Surplus will not be considered for this acquisition.
First Article applies to this requirement and will not be waived.  The requirement calls for contractor testing with delivery of the first article test report within 90 days of the contract date.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253.

<DESC>Sophisticated electronic microsystems can now be made at such low cost that they are increasingly pervasive throughout the battlefield and large numbers can be widely proliferated and used for applications such as distributed remote sensing and communications. However, it is nearly impossible to track and recover every device, resulting in unintended accumulation in the environment as well as subsequent unauthorized use. DARPA seeks innovative proposals to address this pervasive challenge by developing electronic systems capable of physically disappearing in a controlled, triggerable manner. The goal of the Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) BAA is to develop and establish a basis set of materials, components, integration, and manufacturing capabilities to undergird this new class of electronics.<br /><br />See the full DARPA-BAA-13-23 document attached.

The focus is on a partnership in which we minimize risk, improve construction schedule, try new innovations, and live within the budget. An important role of the contractor is to help acquire the information to reduce risk. We anticipate that your involvement will help reduce errors in design, improve constructability and meet budget goals.<br />This project is located on Reservation Road on the Fond du Lac Reservation which approximately 6 miles west of Duluth, Minnesota. The existing roadway was washed out during a large storm event during June 2012. The old culvert, all of the surrounding embankment and pavement were damaged during this event. The roadway is closed to traffic. <br />Access to the bridge site during construction will be limited to the roadway. Both sides will be accessible to the contractor. This will also be the only area available for contractor's staging of equipment and materials. The roadway is barricaded and gated at the access points. <br />The design of this project is currently only at 30%, but it has been determined that the structure will be a single span pre-stressed reinforced concrete girder bridge. As part of the CM/GC evaluation, perspective contractors will be also evaluated on innovative design/construction methods that may result in a more cost effective project. The successful candidate will be required to procure the bridge girders prior to notice to proceed for construction. <br />This structure will require an experienced bridge contractor due to the following issues:<br />&bull; Sensitive cultural and natural issues associated with this bridge site and there will be limited access to the project site. No work or staging will be allowed outside the existing roadway prism. <br />&bull; Existing trout stream will need to be maintained during construction .<br />&bull; Multiple agency coordination with the Federal Highway Administration, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Fond du Lac Reservation. <br />&bull; Girders will require advance lead time for fabrication and delivery.<br />&bull; Short on-site construction time of only around 4 months due to need to complete the project this year before Winter conditions set in. Delays to the schedule can easily force construction into a 6-month or more delay and require multiple seasons to construct.<br />&bull; Difficult weather conditions ( heavy rain, strong winds, cold temperatures) can cause construction and delivery delays.<br />Estimated Construction Cost Range is from $1,000,000 to $3,000,000<br />Tentative advertisement date for the Request for Proposals (RFP) is February 27, 2013. PLEASE NOTE: The RFP will be available for download on or after February 27, 2013, from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov. Questions related to the RFP must be submitted to CFLContracts@dot.gov or FAX to (720) 963-3360. <br />

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:<br /><br /><br /></strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br /><br />This is a pre-solicitation / notice of intent synopsis for a sole source noncompetitive award to Medical Neurogenetics for genetic testing. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Medical Neurogenetics, One Dunwoody Park, Suite 250, Atlanta, Georgia 30338-6723 to provide genetic testing for Undiagnosed Diseases Program for rare and new genetic disorders, specifically, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), including neurotransmitters, mitochondrial and inflammatory markers to diagnosis disorders of brain chemistry.
<p><strong><br />BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>This is a follow-on requirement. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge.</p>
<p>The DIR-NHGRI-Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP) protocol 76-HG-0238, Clinical Trial Number: NCT00369421 is connected to this clinical testing, which began in 2008 as a vehicle for admitting patients with broader range of inborn errors of metabolism. Under this observational protocol study, patients with long-standing, complex undiagnosed diseases are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for comprehensive evaluation to discover new genetic disorders and/or potential treatments. The UDP program has made 47 diagnoses, which is about 20% of the total number of patients seen in this protocol to date. The Researchers in the Protocol study intend on diagnosing and treating certain inborn errors of metabolism. By doing this, researchers hope to expand their knowledge about these disorders and provide access to patients of interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Patients enrolled in this protocol have been referred with a known or suspected inborn error of metabolism, heritable disorder, or genetic predisposition. Patients participating in this study will be examined and treated on an outpatient basis, if practical. However, patients requiring specialized tests or treatments will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center as necessary. Researchers will use only accepted medical procedures in diagnosing (medical history, physical examinations, X-ray studies, eye examinations, blood tests, and urine tests) and treating the patients involved in this study.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), intends to procure statistical services from the University of Bristol. The Institute intends to purchase this service by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.
<p>NIH and The University of Bristol have a long term collaborative relationship identifying early childhood behaviors that increase risk of later alcohol and substance misuse, which is critical for identifying potential prevention interventions. The study originally enrolled approximately 14,500 pregnancies and has followed these families until children reach adulthood. Data is available for these analyses and links dietary patterns of mother in pregnancy, children, adolescents and phenotypic characterizations of their alcohol and substance misuse behaviors. The previous research began the characterization of diet and environment that may influence development of alcohol and substance abuse disorders. Continued research requires statistical work to 1) characterize the clusters of childhood behaviors that increase risk of later alcohol and substance misuse and 2) continue to examine effects of dietary patterns, seafood intake, blood compositional levels, and environmental contaminants and how they influence the clusters of childhood risk behaviors and alcohol and substance misuse behaviors. The data already done in the previous ten-year study is only available from the University of Bristol. To change vendors would be detrimental to the research already performed. A different vendor might add different variables and would duplicate the work already performed and would not be cost effective to the Government.</p>

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to issue a modification to extend the ordering period of the Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract, N68335-08-D-0015, on a sole source basis, with Quality Performance Inc (QPI), 11207 Single Oak Road, Fredericksburg, VA 22407 for the production of the Moriah Wind System - AN/SMQ-13 through 16 April 2015 as the award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.
<p>The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 3204 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. All efforts are being made at this time to continue the development of a request for proposal for a follow-on effort, however, the Moriah Wind System configuration baseline is unstable at this time due to obsolescence issues the Government is experiencing with the Sub-Processor Unit (SPU), SPU software, the Low End Display, the High End Display (HED), and HED software. Until the configuration baseline is re-established, the production of the Moriah system cannot be competed.</p>
<p>The Government does not anticipate procuring data rights and competitive drawing package for this effort as the Original Equipment Manufacturer is unwilling to sell their data rights. A determination by the Government, not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within fifteen (15) days of publication of this notice. The Point of Contact is Ms. Shannon Lis, Shannon.Lis@navy.mil, Code 2.5.2.5.3 SL, (732) 323-7063.</p>

<CONTACT>KATIE FREEMAN 215-697-4704
<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to issue American Systems on an other than full and open competitive basis, a cost plus fixed fee contract for the Command and Control (C2) Capability Development, Requirements and Management to the Joint Staff J6 for the period from 01 June 2013 through 31 March 2014.  The estimated level of effort is 37,149 man-hours. Performance of the required services requires that contractor personnel possess a current Top Secret (TS) Clearance and the contractor to possess and maintain a Top Secret (TS) facility clearance from the Defense Security Service. This is an interim action and the resultant contract will provide the requiring activity with the necessary services while the contracting office solicits and awards a contract or contracts through competitive procedures.
 American Systems is currently providing the required services under task order W91C9G-07-D-0002 Task Order 0014 and is the only qualified source that can assist with the C4/Cyber capabilities analysis, reviewing Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirements documentation, and providing support to technology and capability assessments.  Loss or delay of this effort will jeopardize both ICD development continuity and ability to successfully accomplish technical and staffing collaboration with the USAF for JROC approval.  The ongoing technology assessments and support to monthly Functional Capability Boards (FCBs) and the Joint Capability Board (JCB) are also in sensitive stages of both technical assessment and development.
 Without continued support, the mission Joint Staff J6 as well as those of the Combatant Commands who rely on these airspace management capabilities will be jeopardized. American Systems is the only qualified contractor who has the experience, personnel, and expertise to maintain the continuity of services without disrupting the mission of the Joint Staff J6 by 01 June 2013. The solicitation will be made available electronically, upon its release, at www.neco.navy.mil. Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above mentioned website for posting of the solicitation and any amendments thereto. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by 28 February 2013.
 This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. However, the Government will consider information received by 28 February 2013. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice. The NAICS code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $14M. For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Katie Freeman, Code 290.2A, at (215) 697-4704, or at Katie.freeman@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Research and Development, Technology Transfer Program intends to solicit a commercial requirement for its new legal and litigation services.  It is contemplated that this will be a multiple award IDIQ contract set aside for SDVOSB's and VOSB's; the government however reserves the right to make the final determination based on the number, type, and quality of proposals received.  

The Office of Research and Development (ORD) is the research arm of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The major emphasis of ORD is to advance VA medical research and development programs that address veterans' needs, with an emphasis on service-connected injuries and illnesses, and that contribute to the Nation's knowledge of disease and disability. A secondary benefit of these research endeavors is the transfer to the healthcare delivery system of new and beneficial technologies resulting from research conducted throughout the VA medical centers. Through its Technology Transfer Program (TTP) ORD facilitates the translation of VA discoveries into practice. TTP educates inventors on the process of translating discoveries into commercial products while facilitating disclosure of discoveries/ inventions, evaluates inventions, obtains patents, fosters CRADAs (Cooperative R&D Agreements), and facilitates the commercialization of these discoveries/ inventions. TTP is committed to the timely processing of invention disclosures and all subsequent actions required for bringing VA technologies to the marketplace.

TTP receives approximately 300 disclosures per year. Because of VA's historic close working relationship with affiliated academic medical centers, most of VA's inventions are jointly owned with our affiliates, who often take the lead in patenting and commercialization. This is facilitated by Cooperative Technology Administration Agreements that VA has entered into with over 60 leading affiliated academic medical centers. TTP directly manages about 20% of the disclosed inventions. The remainder are managed by our affiliates. TTP alone files approximately 30 patent applications each year, and receive approximately 5 issued patents. To date, VA or its affiliates have entered into over 200 licenses with companies to further develop VA owned inventions.

The VA has ownership of inventions discovered by VA investigators. These inventions require protection by patents which are costly to file, prosecute and maintain, and require professional expertise. These VA intellectual properties (IP) will only be protected by patents. Patent protection is critical in differentiating between products and also leads to licensing specific technologies.

This contract will provide the patent services required by TTP to protect VA owned intellectual property through patent filling and prosecution. These services will assist the VA TTP in developing and commercializing products that will ultimately be made available to veterans and the public. The VA TTP requires support to patent technologies invented within the VA.

The requirement may include a base year and four one-year option periods for a total of five years.  

More detailed information will be found in the solicitation document to include a detailed statement of work and other supporting documentation. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is late November 2012.

<DESC>This notice is for market research only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  The information received under this announcement may be used to purchase items for Government testing and/or to prepare a solicitation package. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Institute of Public Health, Drinking Water and Sanitation Program, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is conducting a market investigation on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Environment, and Energy [ASA (IE&E)], to identify products, suppliers, and manufacturers of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) water quality analysis sets (WQAS) and component equipment with capabilities for deployed Warfighters in austere field operations to monitor their drinking water quality.   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army is interested in identifying companies' products, technologies, and capabilities to provide WQAS or components for the determination of water quality based on the standards outlined in U.S. Army Technical Bulletin Medical 577 (TB MED 577), Sanitary Control and Surveillance of Field Water Supplies (http://armypubs.army.mil/med/index.html).  The market research will focus on test strip, dip stick, hand held meters, and other applicable technologies.  Products of greatest interest are those that will reduce the weight, power, time burdens on the operator, and expand the capabilities of currently fielded solutions in the WQAS-Preventive Medicine (WQAS-PM).  The major components of the current WQAS-PM include: <br>  <br> -	DREL 2800 Spectrophotometer  <br> -	SensIon 156 pH and conductivity meter <br> -	2100P Portable Turbidimeter <br> -	Digital Titrator  <br> -	Colilert P/A (total coliform and E.coli) <br> -	Arsenic Quick Kit (add-on) <br> -	Lead Test Strips (add-on) <br> -	CHEMets Cyanide Test Kit (add-on) <br>  <br> Lightweight versions of the WQAS-PM are fielded with a handheld DR890 colorimeter in lieu of the DREL 2800 spectrophotometer.   <br>  <br> WQAS components sought are lightweight, easy to operate and maintain, compact in size, ruggedized and capable of providing rapid and  accurate results consistent with or superior to currently fielded solutions such as the WQAS-PM.  Reagents and test strips should have an unused storage life of a minimum one year.    <br>  <br> Products should be able to analyze or screen for one or more of the Military Field Water Standards (MFWS) outlined in TB MED 577 or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Primary and National Secondary Drinking Water Standards.  The detection limit ranges for these analytes and water quality parameters should meet or exceed the ranges identified in TB MED 577.  Methods of testing should involve minimal manipulation by relatively untrained personnel, and calculations should be avoided or held to a minimum.  Batteries, if used, must be commercially-available and compatible with commercial shipping and air transit requirements. <br>  <br> Interested companies should respond no later than 29 March 2013 with information on their current commercial product(s) and how they might address the capability for monitoring water quality in field operations by deployed Warfighters.  Responses should include information regarding company background/experience, personnel, and facilities.  Product information provided should include cost, detailed technical information (i.e., technical literature, independent or pending laboratory test data, capacity data, device temperate exposure data, as well as illustrations, photographs, any relevant patents  and one or more samples of the test equipment for evaluation (optional) or instructions on how the equipment may be obtained.  Firms responding should indicate whether or not they are small, and women-, veteran-, and/or minority-owned businesses.  A point of contact, telephone and fax numbers, web address, and e-mail address should be provided.  Any information/samples submitted will not be returned (unless return arrangements are agreed upon beforehand).  Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Christopher Childs, U.S. Army Institute of Public Health, Drinking Water and Sanitation Program, 5158 Blackhawk Road, Building E-1675, MCHB-IP-EWS, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010-5403.  Submit questions or inquiries via e-mail to: christopher.childs2@us.army.mil or via telephone: (803) 729-4308.  This notice is for market research only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  The information received under this announcement may be used to purchase items for Government testing and/or to prepare a solicitation package. <br>

<DESC>NOTE:
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition (541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, Size Standard: 500 employees). Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Division of Drug Safety Research conducts research on the safety, efficacy, metabolism, and other aspects of the mechanisms and effects of pharmaceuticals. The Division of Drug Safety Research has a need to host resistance model using listeria and a Balb/C mouse model pre-dosed with nanoparticles (NPs). Systemic administration of NPs leads to particle accumulation in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system independent of NP core composition, size, or mode of administration. There is, however, little to no information on whether NP accumulation affects macrophage function in vivo. CDER would like to use the listeria host resistance assay to evaluate the function of macrophages in vivo to determine if the systemic administration of nanoparticles suppresses macrophage function to the point of producing observable disease effects.</p>
<p>PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to host resistance models using listeria and a Balb/C mouse model pre-dosed with nanoparticles. The listeria host resistance models shall be used to evaluate the immune response of Balb/C mice after they have been pre-dosed with nanoparticles. The Contractor shall determine if nanoparticles cause a delayed immune response to the listeria challenge or cause the mice to have a more severe infection/longer clearance times for the bacteria. The Contractor shall make this determination through an analysis of bacterial titers, blood and serum analysis, animal observations, early death findings, and histopathology analysis.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>To meet the purpose and objective of this requirement, the Contractor shall perform all aspects of this study, including being responsible for animal model set-up, preparation, dosing, and handling, the listeria challenge, necropsy, and all post-dosing tests and analysis. In particular, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks and provide the following deliverables:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a comprehensive written study plan to the FDA project manager (PM) prior to testing, which shall include an outline of all animal handling, the host resistance model, dosing and post-dosing analysis (including bacterial titers, animal observations, blood and serum analysis, and histopathology analysis), and all endpoint and interim data collected during the study, including protocols, such as validation protocols. The Contactor shall discuss with the PM the appropriate handling and disposal of test samples and compounds prior to the initiation of testing and only follow a study plan approved by the PM.</p>
<p>&bull; Inject Balb/C mice with vehicle, nanoparticle, or positive control once per week for up to four weeks. The Contractor shall discuss and get approval from the PM concerning the appropriate handling of dosing materials prior to initiation of this study. The Contractor shall perform the injections only in accordance with approved instructions provided by the PM.</p>
<p>&bull; Challenge mice with a five to 35% lethal dose of listeria via intravenous injection or vehicle. The Contractor shall use approximately 180 mice with 10 mice per group, six groups, and three time points. The exact number of mice may change based on discussions between the Contractor and the PM and determined by the PM.</p>
<p>&bull; Perform bacterial titers during a specified time course: approximately on day one, day four, and day seven of testing. The Contractor shall determine titers in peripheral blood, spleen, liver, and lungs.

<DESC>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a project underway in Saint Paul-lez-Durance, France (ITER Cadarache site) to construct a device that will demonstrate nuclear fusion power at a powerplant-relevant scale (http://www.iter.org/). Work scope associated with diagnostics systems supplied to ITER by the US is assigned to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a national laboratory operated for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) by Princeton University under Contract No. DE-AC02-09CH11466, and PPPL is responsible for the work described in a Statement of Work (SOW) that will be published as part of the above-referenced PPPL RFP No. 13-031. The RFP SOW will cover a portion of the Low-Field-Side (LFS) Reflectometer system that is one of the diagnostic systems being provided by the US. The LFS X-mode system, reflecting off the upper cutoff, is used to probe the scrape-off layer (SOL) profile. The LFS O-mode system is used to provide the profile in the outboard gradient region. The radial extent of the probed region for each of these systems depends on plasma parameters, the toroidal field, the probing frequency ranges and polarization. It is anticipated that the Supplier selected as a result of this RFP shall form a collaborative team with one or two subcontractors that distributes the tasks described in the RFP SOW. The desired outcome of this solicitation is to award a subcontract to an institution that will lead a LFS Reflectometer collaborative team that has the collective expertise and experience to complete the LFS Reflectometer R&amp;D and design phase and also have the expertise, experience and resources to develop the software and fabricate and deliver the LFS Reflectometer hardware identified in the SOW. The Supplier shall have responsibility for the transmission line performance testing, physics modeling and coupling to support preliminary and final design and specifying and overseeing fabrication and testing of instrumentation able to make fluctuation and profile measurements consistent with measurement requirements. Providing real-time analysis for feedback control shall also be the responsibility of the Supplier. The Supplier selected shall interface directly with each subcontractor and manufacturer to coordinate activities and maintain an effective Quality Assurance Program with implementing procedures to assure compliance with this SOW. PPPL shall be informed of activities and shall have final approval authority with benefit of recommendations of the Supplier. The Supplier shall develop and maintain an overall schedule for the design and production of the equipment including major milestones. It is the intent of PPPL to distribute a Request for Proposals (RFP) to perform the work objectives described in the SOW. The subcontract period of performance for the R&amp;D and preliminary and final design phase will be approximately&nbsp;three years (June 2013 through&nbsp;September 2016). The proposed subcontract to be awarded to the LFS collaborative team will also have an option to award the fabrication phase of the SOW based on the design and requirements approved at the FDR. This announcement is not a solicitation and does not obligate PPPL to issue a solicitation. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a statement demonstrating their capabilities to perform this work. Information submitted should describe your organization, personnel, facilities, applicable subcontractor network and past experience to meet specific needs stated above. Include company name, address, telephone number, technical point of contact, item nomenclature, item description, and brochure/literature. Please send your documentation to Rodney Templon at the office identified above, by fax to (609) 243-2021 or by email to <a href="mailto:rtemplon@pppl.gov">rtemplon@pppl.gov</a>. Electronic submittals are preferred. To be considered by PPPL, documentation should be received within twenty (20) working days after the date of publication of this synopsis. Please be advised that PPPL will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement.

<DESC>U. S. Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC) seeks to identify individuals or organizations, domestic or foreign, interested in partnering with USAMRMC in the development of bacteriophages as U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medical therapeutic products for human clinical indications.  In particular, USAMRMC would like to hear from entities interested in bacteriophages as treatments for the following infections: skin and soft tissue infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus; and bacterial diarrhea. USAMRMC believes that a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) would be a suitable framework for the establishment of a partnering relationship.  While USAMRMC cannot supply funding under a CRADA, USAMRMC resources (facilities, materiel, and labor) can be used to support the manufacturing and testing efforts needed for medical product development.  To respond to this Request for Information (RFI), e-mail a brief (no more than 5 pages) statement of interest to shannyn.scassero@amedd.army.mil.  This statement of interest should (1) identify the bacteriophage(s) you believe are suitable for development of medical products; (2) describe in general terms the manufacturing process for the bacteriophage(s) preparations; (3) present a summary of the results of relevant nonclinical and clinical studies bearing on product safety and efficacy; (4) state any interest you have as an inventor or owner of an invention, or holder of any other type of interest that permits you to exploit, or prevent others from exploiting, relevant technologies; and (5) outline your concept for development of bacteriophages as products approved for marketing by the FDA.  USAMRMC will evaluate your statement of interest and maintain it as trade secrets and/or confidential business information.  If it appears to USAMRMC that further communications are warranted, USAMRMC will contact you.  This RFI does not commit the Government to acquire supplies or services or award any type of contracting vehicle to include assistance agreements. <br>

Workflow Management Services
1.	BACKGROUND
The Chief Business Office (CBO) is responsible for a broad range of business activities associated with health care benefit delivery. These activities occur both at the national and local medical facility level and are governed by statute and policy. The CBO is responsible for developing the business processes supporting the statute and policy governing VHA business programs. In addition, CBO is responsible for the timely and appropriate resolution of veteran inquiries and cases.
The Contractor shall provide services to define, create, and maintain a workflow management system using the workflow engine BizFlow (http://www.handysoft.com/) to manage tasks within the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) Income Verification Division (IVD), Eligibility and Enrollment Division (EED), Business Services Division (BSD) and Chief Business Office Systems Management (CSM). Most of these workflow/work load management processes are currently managed using multiple databases, spreadsheets, and applications. The Contractor shall also provide BiZFlow training.
2.	SCOPE OF WORK
CBO Member Services will utilize the workflow engine as a tool to improve and streamline operations. The Contractor shall identify and analyze appropriate applications, databases, and services required to ensure the implementation fully incorporates components such as Identity Management Services, Content Management Systems, Documentation Services, and Web Services. 
IVD uses Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to manage their workload. The Contractor shall provide analysis and services to implement a workflow management process to assign, track, manage, close and report on all case types within IVD. The purpose is to efficiently collect work tracking information without requiring dual entry, to seamlessly interface with existing Enrollment Database (EBD aka IVM 2.9) infrastructure, and allow for flexibility in modifying existing workflow processes and setting up new workflow processes (such as Appeals management). Upon completion, the workflow processes shall enhance operational efficiencies and provide a reduction in operating costs.
EED has two Microsoft Access databases to manage workload; the Workload Reporting and Productivity (WRAP) application manages Enrollment and Eligibility staff workload; and the Caregiver Tracking Application (CAT) manages Medical Center, Enrollment, Call Center (Health Resource Center), and the Health Administration Center staff who provide support to Caregivers. The Contractor shall provide analysis and services to implement a workflow management process to assign, track, manage, close and report on all case types within EED. The purpose is to efficiently collect work tracking information without requiring dual entry, to seamlessly interface with existing Enrollment System (ES aka ESR) infrastructure, and allow for flexibility in modifying existing workflow processes and setting up new workflow processes. Upon completion, the workflow processes shall enhance operational efficiencies and provide a reduction in operating costs.
The BSD mailroom has been processing correspondence since 2005 using Opex scanners and imaging software to convert into an appropriate format for extraction, retrieval and indexing. These images are then converted to a readable format (optical character recognition, OCR) for further processing and distribution. The images are stored on disk and tapes, and also made available for viewing to the mailroom, EED, and IVD staff through their desktops. The Contractor shall provide analysis and services to implement a workflow management process to manage, assign, track, close and report on all correspondence cases within BSD. The purpose is to efficiently collect work tracking information without requiring dual entry, to seamlessly interface with existing imaging (Opex, http://www.opex.com/) and mailroom applications infrastructure, and allow for flexibility in modifying existing workflow processes and setting up new workflow processes. Upon completion, the workflow processes shall enhance operational efficiencies and provide a reduction in operating costs. 
CSM team members employ specialized knowledge; skills and experience that help reduce a project's level of risk and thereby increase its likelihood of success. The suite of CSM tools improves a project's probability of success by building on what has proven to be successful. Project management processes (e.g., risk management, requirements development, project planning, configuration management, and project monitoring and control) are tailored to fit the size and scope of the project and provide proven procedures that lead to a desired result. The phases included in the CSM project management approach include initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing out the project by transferring the completed product to the stakeholders and end users. The definition, creation, and setup of workflow process to initiate project requests from various stakeholders (such as the CBO Business Engineering Services Team), track status, monitor projects and tasks to further increase the likelihood of project success and provide senior managers with the visibility into the status of a project. 
The business owners (in addition to the HEC IT staff) need to have the authority and capability to create, modify, or deactivate workflows and any reports associated with them. To ensure the appropriate staff is able to perform these functions, the contractor shall deliver workflow training to the HEC IT, CSM, and business owners responsible for maintaining the workflow rules and system.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)<br />17 January 2012
<p><br />NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE- SOURCE FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source Flexseal Follow-on contract under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 (a)(2), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This authority will be supported by a sole source Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) which will be posted separately to FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>The Government has conducted extensive market research leading up to development of its acquisition strategy. A FedBizOpps posting of a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), Reference Number FA8818-11-R-0001, posted 16 December 2009, resulted in two responses. The industry responses have identified two potential contractors. However, additional research has shown that only one source is currently qualified for this type of work. As such, a sole source solicitation will be released upon approval of the Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) document for a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>This sole source follow-on contract will allow Aerojet GenCorp to continue to provide an end product and mission support for the Flexseal retrofit. The current contractual vehicle for these critical requirements expired 30 September 2011. This sole source action will result in a Firm-Fixed-Price contract with an estimated contract value of $49M and an estimated award date on or before 31 May 2012.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the notice for the sole source Flexseal follow-on effort.</p>
<p>As stated previously, a sole source award is expected for the follow-on effort and the solicitation for this requirement is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2012. Notices regarding that acquisition will be posted to FedBizOpps.</p>

<p>2. Authority FAR 6.302-1 (C)</p>
<p>3. Agency and the contracting activity. The agency is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames IA intends to buy the following Bruker laboratory equipment and services brand-name equipment.</p>
<p>4. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>A. The Bruker Biotyper Reference Libraries contain profiles of clinical isolates, including mycobacteria and select agents of interest to the NVSL.</p>
<p>B. The Bruker system is in use in veterinary diagnostic laboratories in four other states with a fifth in process of purchasing the Bruker system. Purchase of the Bruker system would provide for the exchange of veterinary isolate profiles among these other labs that use the Bruker system. This would enable all of the labs to have access to updated libraries with additional profiles of specific veterinary isolates. If the NVSL does not purchase a Bruker system, we would not be able to exchange strain profile information with the other veterinary labs using a MALDI system.</p>
<p>C. The particular model required, the autoflex is suitable for proteomics and other mass spec projects in addition to identification of bacterial isolates.</p>
<p>5. Other sources were evaluated, but didn't meet our requirements.</p>
<p>BioMerieux was evaluated. Their system library has emphasis on microbial isolates of pharmaceutical interest which would not meet the need for libraries of veterinary isolates. Also, this system is not upgradable for use in proteomics projects.</p>
<p>6. <strong>These 3 items must be 100 percent compatible with the Brunker Autoflex Speed LRF MALDI-TOF, Software-CD Reference Library, MALDI BIOTYPER 3.0 Software, Database-CD MALDI Biotyper, and Powervar UPS ABCDEF3000-22.</strong></p>

<DESC>Notice of intent to sole source and exercise the extension of services clause for an additional six months of stevedoring and related terminal services in the Port of Nordenham, Germany. This extension is made to a contract originally awarded on a sole source basis. The follow on contract will also be awarded to the same sole source contractor as they are a sole provider of services in this port.  The need of this extension is to alleviate any risk of break in service while the new sole source contract is negotiated with the same contractor by a new procuring contracting office.  The current contracting office is transitioning this contract to a stateside contracting office, thus the time required to plan and transition these services.  This is not a request for proposal only a notice of our intent to award this extension of services on a sole source basis to the current sole source contractor.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation,  Columbia Cascades Area Office in Yakima, Washington intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Rogue Basin Coordinating Council in Eagle Point, Oregon to collect signed land access agreements with interested parties which will allow Reclamation and Reclamation representatives (e.g., surveyors, engineers, contractors) to conduct work on private land or use private land as access points to others' land.  In addition, Reclamation will use the LBCWC to facilitate further coordination and outreach with watershed residents. Reclamation requires assistance with landowner coordination, landowner access agreements, and public outreach within the South Fork Little Butte Creek Watershed.  This work is to support Reclamation's work as part of the Rogue Basin Biological Opinion (BiOP) which includes implementing coho salmon habitat projects.  Because Reclamation does not own land in this area Reclamation must work with local landowners to implement projects on private property within the Little Butte Creek watershed.
This sole source intent is under the authority of FAR Part 6.03  Firms believing they can provide the PIT tags must provide written notification to the Contracting Officer with supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations and award of this requirement will not be delayed to qualify a new contractor. 
Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-00-NIB-0564<br />Name:		Towel, Cleaning, Non-woven Microfiber, Disposable, 16" x 16"<br />Description:	16" x 16" non-woven disposable microfiber cleaning towel. Towel is absorbent, non-abrasive, and low lint. Towel is compatible with quat disinfectants and sanitizers, providing surfaces with a higher level of disinfection and bacterial removal. UOI is BX. BX= 200 cleaning towels.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7920-00-NIB-0564<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	RCP1805727; GEP29616; RCPQ610/620/630; KIM83610; UNSBLUECLOTH</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 28, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell office, janitorial, and other products to the offices included at the Barnes Federal Building.<br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of a Base Supply Center at the Barnes Federal Building.</p>
<p><br />National Industries for the Blind (NIB), an AbilityOne Program designated central nonprofit agency (CNA), is currently in discussions with officials at the Barnes Federal Building to establish a Base Supply Center (BSC).  BSCs are retail stores on military installations and in Federal office buildings that sell a wide range of office, janitorial, and other products primarily to meet the same-day shopping needs of Government customers.</p>
<p>The Commission approves the addition of BSCs to its PL primarily as outlets for the sale of AbilityOne products.  The sale of AbilityOne products to Government customers is one of the ways that the Commission accomplishes its mission of creating employment opportunities for people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities.  The Commission also allows the sale of a wide variety of non-AbilityOne products referred to as convenience items in the BSC to make each store a same day, one-stop shopping option for Government customers.  The Government purchase card (GPC) is the primary means of payment for products purchased in BSCs.   Use of the BSC by Barnes Federal Building customers is not mandatory.  It is simply another shopping option for your GPC holders.</p>
<p>Typically, BSCs carry a full range of office, janitorial, and sanitation supplies and almost any other product being legitimately sought for purchase by the GPC holder.</p>
<p>The addition of a BSC to the Commission's PL follows a deliberative process.  Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 51-2.4 requires that the Commission consider the level of impact on the total sales of commercial firms from whom Government purchasers are currently buying the same or similar products being proposed for sale in the BSC.  Although sales in the retail environment are not guaranteed to any firm, it is possible that the level of business being done with local small businesses in (BSC Site) area will be diverted to the BSC as GPC holders opt to shop at the on-installation BSC.  The kinds of firms that could be affected might include any businesses that sell office, janitorial, sanitation, and hardware supplies to GPC holders.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to enter into a no-cost contract for operation of the BSC at the Barnes Federal Building will be the Defense Contract Management Agency Procurement Center, Boston.<br /> <br />If your firm is currently selling office, janitorial, or other BSC-type products to offices at the Barnes Federal Building it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the office, janitorial, or BSC-type products to offices at the Barnes Federal Building for the same most recent 12-month period.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to offices at the Barnes Federal Building.</p>
<p>6.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>7.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for information for impact analysis for the potential addition of a Base Supply Center at the San Diego Naval Base to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell office, janitorial, and other products to the offices included at the San Diego Naval Base.<br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of a Base Supply Center at the San Diego Naval Base.</p>
<p>National Industries for the Blind (NIB), an AbilityOne Program designated central nonprofit agency (CNA), is currently in discussions with officials at the San Diego Naval Base to establish a Base Supply Center (BSC).  BSCs are retail stores on military installations and in Federal office buildings that sell a wide range of office, janitorial, and other products primarily to meet the same-day shopping needs of Government customers.</p>
<p>The Commission approves the addition of BSCs to its PL primarily as outlets for the sale of AbilityOne products.  The sale of AbilityOne products to Government customers is one of the ways that the Commission accomplishes its mission of creating employment opportunities for people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities.  The Commission also allows the sale of a wide variety of non-AbilityOne products referred to as convenience items in the BSC to make each store a same day, one-stop shopping option for Government customers.  The Government purchase card (GPC) is the primary means of payment for products purchased in BSCs.   Use of the BSC by the San Diego Naval Base customers is not mandatory.  It is simply another shopping option for your GPC holders.</p>
<p>Typically, BSCs carry a full range of office, janitorial, and sanitation supplies and almost any other product being legitimately sought for purchase by the GPC holder.</p>
<p>The addition of a BSC to the Commission's PL follows a deliberative process.  Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 51-2.4 requires that the Commission consider the level of impact on the total sales of commercial firms from whom Government purchasers are currently buying the same or similar products being proposed for sale in the BSC.  Although sales in the retail environment are not guaranteed to any firm, it is possible that the level of business being done with local small businesses in (BSC Site) area will be diverted to the BSC as GPC holders opt to shop at the on-installation BSC.  The kinds of firms that could be affected might include any businesses that sell office, janitorial, sanitation, and hardware supplies to GPC holders.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to enter into a no-cost contract for operation of the BSC at the San Diego Naval Base will be the Naval Support Fleet Logistics Center, San Diego.<br /> <br />If your firm is currently selling office, janitorial, or other BSC-type products to offices at the San Diego Naval Base it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the office, janitorial, or BSC-type products to offices at the San Diego Naval Base for the same most recent 12-month period.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to offices at the San Diego Naval Base.</p>
<p>6.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>7.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>8.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 1, 2013and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VBA, HQ Contracting Activity

This prospective service agreement is administered by the VBA HQ Contracting Activity (0010E). The funding has been secured by the following appropriation and account symbol: 3630151.001 3096-2580 OC 396 (Detroit Regional Office). 

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Justifications-Content, the following information is provided as part of this justification. The responses below are numbered to match each subpart contained in each respective FAR reference.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 

This prospective action being approved is to proceed with issuing a firm-fixed service agreement contract to Liebert Global Services, Inc. to provide the necessary means to conduct Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) system's preventative maintenance on a semi-annual basis. This action will be a new contract identified as VA329-13-F-0025 by using other than full and open competition as written by the FAR.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

The service required by Detroit Regional Office through the requesting IT Staff is to provide preventative maintenance measures on its current UPS system and its batteries. The estimated dollar amount for the base year and four option years totals an estimated $38,760.00. The Detroit Regional Office UPS preventative maintenance shall be conducted through a semi-annual basis to include an emergency response time of four hours after placing a call into the emergency contact. This emergency response time should be available to the Veterans Affairs 24 hours/7 days/week, 365 days a year. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

a. Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1) -

The current UPS equipment can only have maintenance performed by Liebert Services as they hold propriety rights to the machine parts and maintenance. Liebert has not authorized nor appointed any third parties to perform maintenance services, or equipment replacement. The UPS equipment, a mission-critical piece of gear, is vitally important to sustain our IT network. The UPS system is an integral part of VA overall mission to service veterans and serve as the backbone of productivity. If maintenance and support is discontinued, it could result in a catastrophic data loss and productivity. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Liebert has not authorized nor appointed any third parties to perform maintenance services, or equipment replacement. At this moment, the only potential source of maintenance is Liebert Services.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The anticipated cost of this purchase shall be determined fair and reasonable with the use of a should-cost analysis and acquisition history. The should-cost analysis will be completed by gathering historic acquisition data. The data will be analyzed, comparing what was paid previously to current charges. Current economic conditions will be considered. Market research information will be collected and analyzed, providing comparison of similar requirements cost. The percentage ratio of what the unit cost Liebert UPS, compared to what the price quote is, will be calculated, to determine if the quoted price is within industry standards.  
	
Because of the estimated cost being $38,760.00 there will be no requirement for certified cost or pricing data, technical evaluations, or audits, but the contractor will be requested to explain how they have arrived at their price, and what discounts they are providing off commercial list price.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Due to the fact that Liebert holds proprietary rights to the UPS equipment and its maintenance, as well as the fact that Liebert has not authorized or appointed any third parties to perform maintenance services, or equipment, market research for another vendor to provide maintenance on the UPS system was not possible.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

Currently, there are no additional pieces of supporting information to this agreement. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

Liebert Global Services

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

The Detroit Regional Office is requesting that the UPS maintenance be continued for more than one year, due to the life-cycle of the UPS hardware/software still being operational. However, during the next two or three years, it may be appropriate to replace the thirty batteries with the UPS unit. VBA will review the UPS operation and maintenance costs and examine if, at that time, a new acquisition should be completed.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to place a simplified acquisition order with D. Casillas and Associates on a sole source basis. The NSF is seeking to secure the contract services of a professional with extensive labor relations experience; in-depth knowledge of the NSF mission, programs, and unique culture; labor management issues specific to NSF; labor relations negotiation skills, and alternative dispute resolution. The Foundation's LRO position is currently vacant and a nationwide effort is underway to back-fill this critical position. Until such time as the LRO position is filled, including an adequate opportunity for knowledge transfer, contractual services of an experienced LRO with in-depth NSF knowledge are necessary. Such services are critical to ensure that short, mid and long-term labor relations issues of a sensitive and high priority basis continue on an on-going, consistent and high-quality manner. Consultant services will also be required on an as-needed basis to augment and support NSF on labor relations issues once the LRO position is filled. This support is expected to last up to one year. <br /><br />No internal resources exist to backfill this position while it's vacant. A number of highly sensitive labor relations issues currently exist which require immediate and on-going attention. To achieve this a consultant with in-depth knowledge of the Foundation, its' unique programs and staffing, its' union representation and existing labor relations cases is essential to ensure that current issues are resolved in a timely manner and protect the interests of the Foundation.
<p>Many of the issues currently being negotiated are complex and highly sensitive and it is critical that the new Labor Relations officer, once hired, have sufficient opportunity to become familiar with the intricacies of these programs, cases and issues. Thus, a consultant with comprehensive experience in labor relations coupled with a detailed understanding of the Foundation and an in-depth/comprehensive knowledge of existing labor relations and alternative dispute resolution cases is essential to maintain the continuity of the program and ensure an orderly transition for the LRO.</p>
<p>Similarly, there a number of longer-term programs and initiatives, including a new collective bargaining agreement, that will require considerable time and resources; much more than a one-person Labor Relations Office can accomplish in an efficient and expeditious manner. A consultant with comprehensive knowledge of these initiatives and with established and effective communication lines with senior management and the union will facilitate the implementation of these initiatives.</p>
<p>Ms. Docia Casillas is the only consultant that has the requisite skills to accomplish the immediate and critical labor relations needs of the Foundation. Ms. Casillas has the requisite experience as NSF's LRO, has been intimately involved in developing management's position and negotiating with the union on all on-going LRO and ADR issues, and who has intimate knowledge and understanding of all short, mid and long term initiatives that will be undertaken within the Foundation. This in-depth experience and knowledge is necessary to negotiate/resolve existing issues that are unique for the Foundation, ensure an orderly transition for a new LRO, including a complete knowledge transfer, and provide, as necessary, the experience level required to augment the LRO and senior management on issues of a longer-term nature, including re-negotiating the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing, D. Casillas and Associates is the only source reasonably available to perform this effort.</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Award Sole-Source Contract Modification - Cook Inlet Navigation Channel Dredging
<SOLNBR>W911KB-12-C-0004
<RESPDATE>022813
<CONTACT>Aldone Graham, Phone 907-753-2528, Fax 907-753-2544, Email Aldone.R.Graham@usace.army.mil - Christine A. Dale, Contracting Officer, Phone 907 753-5618, Fax 907 753-2544, Email christine.a.dale@usace.army.mil
<DESC><p>In accordance with FAR FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) - the action being approved is a modification to Firm-Fixed Price Contract W911KB-12-C-0004 with Manson Construction Company (contractor - NAICS No. 237990) for the dredging of the Cook Inlet Navigation Channel on days when they are in a stand-by status and not performing maintenance dredging at the Port of Anchorage. The estimated dollar value of the proposed action is $3.5M. The Scope of Work (SOW) for the proposed Cook Inlet dredging modificaiton includes the completion of nine (9) surveys required for dredging activities and dredging of 675,000 CY of material from the Cook Inlet Navigation channel. The current value of the Port of Anchorage dredging project is $15.4M. <br /><br />The Cook Inlet Navigation Channel is approximately 6 miles from the Port of Anchorage, and was constructed to provide safe passage through Knik Arm Shoal to the Port. This channel is the only USCG marked route for all cargo and fuel ships supplying the Port of Anchorage, which is the sole distribution point for 90% of the goods consumed by 595,000 of the 700,000 people that live in Alaska. Additionally the Port of Anchorage is one of 19 commercial ports around the nation designated as a Department of Defense Strategic Seaport. This designation recognized the port's vital role supporting overseas deployments, fuel for Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson, vehicle transportation and goods used in the day-to-day business and commissaries by the 55,000 military and family members in Alaska. <br /><br />Since the original dredging of the channel in 2000, no maintenance dredging has been required; however, there has been a sudden surge in shoal material in the channel over the last two years. In 2012 the condition survey found shoal material 10 feet above an acceptable and safe depth, which has reduced the channel usability by 50% and required shippers and their pilots to take extraordinary measures to avoid running aground while navigating through the channel. Without action, the continued shoaling will require shippers and their pilots to take even more challenging maneuvers while moving through the channel and possibly close the navigation channel to current shipping activity in the near future. The Cook Inlet Navigation Channel is scheduled to be dredged in the Spring of 2013 by the Government dredge ESSAYONS, but its schedule will only allow time for removal of about 25 percent of the available material.<br /><br />NOTE: Any responses to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Governments needs not later than the 15th day after this notice is posted. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the POC indicated on this notice. This notice is not considered a request for bid/quote/proposal. No solicitation documents are available and telephone request for technical will not be honored. No contract delivery order will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Offers will be used during evaluation for comparable sources available that could be potentially more advantageous to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with 
Haworth, Inc., 1 Haworth Center, Holland, MI 49423-9570, for them to furnish and install their UniGroup Too Stations Systems Furniture, utilizing their authorized dealer for the Pittsburgh, PA area (Burke and Michael), that are provided off Haworth, Inc.'s  their GSA FSS Contract# GS-28F-8014H, for the following reasons: 

(Estimated Cost - $69,742.35).

It is essential to the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), to purchase the above described Haworth, Inc. Systems Furniture Items, since VAPHS is in need of Systems Furniture with the following features that are available in this Haworth's Systems Furniture, and not available in any other company's similar product: 

"	Simple planning, installation and reconfiguration: unitized panels and universal connections minimize complexity reducing the total costs associated with managing modular furniture. 
"	Universal connector can accommodate 90, 120 and 180 degree configurations.
"	Panel partition thickness of 2" and available in heights ranging from 32" to 80".
"	Monocoque construction technique for strength and durability.

In addition, it is essential to VAPHS, that it purchase the above described Haworth, Inc. Systems Furniture Items, since the Furniture being purchased has to be able to fit with VAPHS existing Haworth Systems Furniture, and which the Haworth Systems Furniture being purchased will fit with, and since no other manufacturer's Systems furniture, will fit together with VAPHS existing Haworth Systems furniture.

In addition, it is essential to purchase the items from Haworth, Inc., since Phil Todd of Haworth Inc, has indicated that no other GSA Contractor could offer a lower price than their price, and since Haworth, Inc, would require the other GSA Contractors to use their authorized dealer/installer for the Pittsburgh, PA area (Burke and Michael), to perform the delivery and installation services, which the Contracting Officer has learned, the other GSA Contractors cannot do, since Val Sowa of Burke and Michael has informed the Contracting Officer, that Burke and Michael, would not perform delivery and installation services in Pittsburgh, for another GSA Contractor, since they have already quoted on behalf of Haworth, Inc.. 
Therefore, since no other GSA Contractor would be able to utilize Burke and Michael to perform the delivery and installation services, for the above mentioned reasons, and since VAPHS (the Government's) minimum need is to have a Turnkey Furnish and Install job, the Contracting Officer has concluded that Haworth, Inc. is the only responsible and sole source for this Furnish and Install requirement/GSA Delivery Order Contract. 

This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest; accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than 2/18/2012 COB.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial supply and/or service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is F2VUEN3023AQ01. This acquisition is a small business set aside. The 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following:
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT (BRAND NAME or EQUAL):</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - Contractor shall replace 480 UPS batteries in BLDG 156 at USSOCOM. Contractor shall remove and dispose of old batteries (with environmental clearance certificate) and install batteries and perform UPS calibration. Batteries shall be GNB S12V500F, quantity 480. This is a brand name or equal requirement; or equal batteries must have 165 AH and come with a 3 year replacement warranty. Please include and break out all costs for shipping, handling, delivery, installation, and calibration.</p>
<p>*****There are three (3) UPS machines that require battery replacement. Each UPS has a rated output of 500 kVA and contains four (4) cabinets, each cabinet houses forty (40) batteries. The battery room is located on the first floor with an exterior double door entrance. The batteries can be delivered directly to the site; however, HQ USSOCOM HAS NO HEAVY OFF-LIFT CAPABILITY!!! THE DELIVERY DRIVER AND COMPANY WILL NEED TO BRING THEIR OWN FORKLIFT, PALLET JACKS, PERSONNEL, AND INCIDENTALS TO OFF-LOAD THE BATTERIES. Work can be performed during normal business, Monday through Friday, but be advised real-world situations may necessitate a delay in installation albeit on an ad-hoc basis. HQ USSOCOM will do everything possible to minimize disrupting the installation of the batteries and UPS calibration. The following are the model/serial numbers for the three (3) UPS machines:</p>
<p>GE Power System SG Series<br />- UPS #1 S/N P15001108B154N<br />- UPS #2 S/N P15001908B296N<br />- UPS #3 S/N P15001009B682N</p>
<p>Current systems are GE; therefore the UPS calibration MUST be done by a GE certified technician. The GE certified technician does not necessarily need to accomplish the removal and install, but will need to accomplish the following: The contractor shall provide a factory trained and certified GE Power Systems technician to diagnose, calibrate, test and certify the installation of all the batteries and that the installation has been accomplished correctly and within the factory specified standards as required by GE Power Systems. The technician shall use the appropriate GE Power Systems proprietary software as required by GE Power Systems to correctly diagnose, calibrate, test and certify the aforementioned GE Power Systems UPS machines.*****</p>

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Government's policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals. Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products. EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials. Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) required federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products. Moreover, it required that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009), required federal agencies to analyze internal processes and revise reporting requirements in order to achieve such results as improvement of water use and efficiency, promoting pollution prevention and elimination of waste. But more particularly as related to procurement, an emphasis was placed on efforts to advance sustainable acquisitions to ensure that 95 percent of new contract actions including task and delivery orders, for products and services with the exception of acquisition of weapon systems, are energy-efficient (Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated), water-efficient, bio-based, environmentally preferable (e.g., Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) certified), non-ozone depleting, contain recycled content, or are non-toxic or less-toxic alternatives, where such products and services meet agency performance requirements.</p>
<p>&sect; 1. Mandatory Use of Paper and Other Products with Recycled Content.</p>
<p>(a) All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor, by responding to this solicitation, affirmatively acknowledges that it will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm. In addition, by responding to this solicitation the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.</p>
<p>&sect; 2 Notice of Green Alternatives in Offerors' Product/Service.</p>
<p>(a) When offering a product or service that contains "Green" components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm, the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.</p>
<p>&sect; 2 Affirmative Duty of Contractors to Adhere to Green Contracting Policy.</p>
<p>(a) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.</p>
<p>(b) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is OPM2613Q0104 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC)2005-64 dated January 18, 2013.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. This procurement is set-aside exclusively for small businesses, allowing only a small business to submit proposals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Center for Leadership Development (CLD) provides high quality leadership and management development for supervisors, managers and executives across the Federal government through both multi-agency and single-agency designed courses. OPM has established two leadership institutes, the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville (FEI), Virginia, and the Management Development Center's (MDC's) with locations in Shepherdstown, West Virginia and Aurora, Colorado. OPM also offers courses at the OPM Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and at other locations. <br /><br />As a Federal business enterprise, CLD provides services that assist Federal agencies in achieving their missions by providing competency-based leadership programs to build great leaders for great government.</p>
<p>One course offered by CLD is the Effective Writing in the Federal Government: Leading with the Written Word (EFW). The current EFW course design utilizes a standard classroom format with in-person instruction. The EFW includes a series of modules that cover subject matter presentations and exercises that correspond with relevant OPM competencies. The EFW is not to be considered a basic writing course. It is designed to prompt and teach participants how the Federal government announces, defends, investigates, regulates, explains issues and systems, and procures products and services that run the country and impact the American people. The course also explores how Federal employees compose, review, edit, and issue critical and sensitive written materials for diverse audiences including national and international groups. For those who write for regulatory, investigative, and oversight agencies, to name a few, the need for effective writing is critical to the success of their organizations. The need to rid documents of cluttered or unclear language has been made a priority by government executives.</p>
<p>In support of its mission, OPM needs to acquire no more than (5) contractors to provide Visiting Program Director (VPD) services the Effective Writing in the Federal Government: Leading with the Written Word (EFW) courses.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award no more than (5) Firm-fixed Price purchase orders to the offeror(s) that represents the best value to the government. The offeror shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract, see Statement of Objectives (SOO) detailed below. The period of performance is listed in the SOO below.</p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit their quotations to OPM Contracting in response to this notice by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), February 21, 2013. Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at Shannon.Kennedy@opm.gov through 10:00 AM EST, February 15, 2013. Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to Shannon.Kennedy@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Technical and Pricing proposals MUST be in two separate files. If your technical and price proposals are not submitted in two separate files, your response to this solicitation will be considered non-responsive and will not be given any further consideration. Each of the parts shall be separate and complete, so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of and concurrently with the evaluation of the others.<br />All communications shall be directed to the attention of:</p>
<p>Name: Shannon G. Kennedy<br />Title: Contracting Officer<br />Telephone: 304-870-8065<br />Email: Shannon.Kennedy@opm.gov</p>
<p>NOTE: COMMUNICATIONS WITH OFFICIALS OTHER THAN THE OPM CONTRACTING OFFICER INDICATED ABOVE, MAY COMPROMISE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THIS ACQUISITION AND RESULT IN THE CANCELLATION OF THE SOLICITATION AND/OR EXCLUSION OF YOUR PROPOSAL FROM THIS SOLICITATION.</p>

<p><br />The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>I) Technical Capabilities<br />a) Experience<br />b) Understanding of the Requirement<br />II) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates an award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract resulting from this solicitation. The contract will be awarded to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government reserves the right to award without discussions; therefore, it is critical that each proposal be fully responsive. However, the Contracting Officer also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES - The proposals will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Capabilities. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. The Government must receive enough information to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>PRICE - The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the attached Pricing Templates for the Base Period and two (2) Option Periods and must be provided separately from your technical capabilities. Please note that columns C, D and F are password protected. Cell E must be completed using currency format ($0.00) in order for the extended price column (F) to calculate the correct total.</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES - The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work.<br />Sub Factor a. EXPERIENCE - The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub Factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT - The government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the SOW, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No Adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings: Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follow. No Adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II - Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Capabilities - will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Acceptable - A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - A proposal that contains major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicate a lack of understanding of the SOW that may result in not being capable of meeting all the requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors - The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Capabilities and its sub factors are significantly more important than Factor II, Price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II, Price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Proposals are due by Monday, February 25, 2013 at 9:00 a.m. EST. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Submit proposals to the attention of Jo Scott via email to: scott.jo@dol.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is soliciting proposals from offerors having the capability to act as a centralized laboratory to carry out validated quantitative and/or qualitative assays for a variety of compounds in biological specimens collected from preclinical and clinical studies. The data obtained will be used by NIDA to support the development of new medications for the treatment of drug addiction. The laboratory must be able to perform the tasks listed below:
<p>1. Quantitative assay for samples collected from metabolic, pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies:</p>
<p>The laboratory must be able to perform quantitative assays for samples collected from preclinical metabolic and pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies, as well as samples collected from all phases of clinical studies. The analytes include, but are not limited to, potential therapeutic compounds and/their metabolites, abused drugs and/their metabolites, concomitant medications/compounds, and endogenous substances (e.g. proteins, enzymes etc). Sample matrices include biological fluids (plasma, urine, saliva, etc) and tissues (liver, brain, hair etc). The analytical laboratory must be able to develop and validate new assay methods for drugs/metabolites for which established assays do not exist. The analytes may appear in biological matrices at concentrations of low ng/mL or subnanogram/mL and therefore require the use of state of the art analytical methods including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and immunoassays.</p>
<p>2. Assay for surrogate outcome measures and/molecular biomarkers (protein, enzymes, etc.):</p>
<p>The laboratory must be able to perform assays for surrogate outcome measures and/molecular biomarkers for the assessment of efficacy and safety of study medications in clinical trials. Monitoring of abused drugs in biological fluids serves as a surrogate outcome measure for assessing drug use in clinical trials. The abused drugs include, but are not limited to, cocaine/benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite), methamphetamine, amphetamine, morphine (or morphine-glucuronide), cannabinoids, and benzodiazepines. Automated qualitative/semi-quantitative immunoassays are generally used for screening of abused drugs in biological fluids, primarily in urine. Validated quantitative methods using GC-MS or LC-MS are generally required for confirmatory/quantitative assay for samples which showed positive for screening. Immunoassays are generally required for quantitative assay of molecular biomarkers.</p>
<p>3. Sample collection and shipping containers, as well as on-site test devices:</p>
<p>The laboratory is required to supply clinical sites with sample collection and shipping containers, as well as on-site test devices for screening of abused drugs.</p>
<p>The methods for quantitative assays must be validated for reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at the concentration ranges required for the preclinical and clinical studies. The laboratory must follow appropriate Food and Drug Administration guidance regarding assay validation and the assay must be carried out in compliance with pertinent current Good Laboratory Practices regulations. The laboratory must have automated equipment for handling sample preparation and injection as well as computer software for data acquisition and report generation. The laboratory must also have sufficient resources to ensure high throughput of samples and must provide secured facilities appropriate for storing biological samples and analytical data as well as computerized systems for tracking samples.</p>
<p>In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that the successful offeror possess a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Registration for Chemical Analysis or DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V controlled substances and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.</p>
<p>NIDA anticipates the award of a single, five-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) task order contract. NIDA may award either cost reimbursement and/or fixed price task orders under this contract. NIDA anticipates that at least one task order will be awarded with the initial contract.</p>

The current estimated award date is March 11, 2013. All dates below are based on this estimate. The actual dates in the contract award document will be based upon the actual award date. Because a requirements type contract is contemplated 16.503(a)(1) states that "For the information of offerors and Contractors, the Contracting Officer shall state a realistic estimated total quantity in the solicitation and resulting contract. This estimate is not a representation to an offeror or Contractor that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal. The Contracting Officer may obtain the estimate from records of previous requirements and consumption, or by other means, and should base the estimate on the most current information available." The current overall annual amount of estimated hours needed is 1200. As delivery requirements are defined firm fixed-price task orders will be issued based on the rates provided in the contract and the number of hours needed.<br />Base Period (Date of Award 3/11/2013 - 3/10/2014)<br />CLIN Description UOM Unit Price<br />0001 Administrative Assistant HR tiny_mce_marker______<br />Option Period 1 (3/11/2014 - 3/10/2015)<br />CLIN Description UOM Unit Price<br />0002 Administrative Assistant HR tiny_mce_marker______<br />Option Period 1 (3/11/2015 - 3/10/2016)<br />CLIN Description UOM Unit Price<br />0003 Administrative Assistant HR tiny_mce_marker______<br />(vi) Description of Requirements: See the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for detail.<br />(vii) Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and Acceptance.

The Contractor's response to the following factors in descending order of importance will be used to evaluate offers. The factors describe the qualities that are delivered.<br />SELECTION CRITERIA - The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(1) FACTOR 1 - Technical Capability (Prior Experience and Management of Similar Requirements)<br />Instructions to Offeror - Submit a well defined approach to successfully accomplish the work described in the statement of work. Define how work will be accomplished.<br />Evaluation Criteria - The contractor will require the ability to be trained in the use of the National Easement Staging Tool (NEST), to review and understand the Wetland Reserve Program policy and other conservation easement programs in order to be able to provide assistance to the NRCS Easement Programs Staff. Assistance to the Easement Staff includes assisting with closing easements and preparing the paperwork included in this process. The paperwork includes preparing offer letters, payment obligations, title review, obtaining information from the field office, obtaining information from the contracted closing attorney, obtaining information from the Office of General Counsel, preparing closing packages and obtaining final title opinions. Experience would be desired in these areas but is not required. The technical capability will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror possesses the ability to provide the technical services required by this solicitation. To be considered technically acceptable the offeror must demonstrate a clear understanding of all requirements and demonstrate that as a contractor it has technical expertise to perform this service. Knowledge of federal government easement program requirements and procedures will receive additional weight.<br />FACTOR 2 - Technical/ Past Performance<br />Instructions to offeror: Include descriptions of similar project experience in Tennessee and/or surrounding states. Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully.<br />Evaluation Criteria - Past Performance will be evaluated as Acceptable or Not Acceptable. The offeror shall submit three past performance references to support its ability to meet the Government's objectives. The offeror's similar experience will also be evaluated based on demonstrated commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of quality services.<br />In accordance with the table below, an offeror's past performance shall be rated Acceptable, Unacceptable or Unknown. For offerors without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonable assigned, the offeror shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have Unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, Unknown shall be considered Acceptable.<br />Past Performance will be rated according to the following table below.<br />Rating<br />Acceptable<br />Description<br />Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or<br />- 5 -<br />the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable<br />Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />The technical factors and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price.<br />FACTOR 3 - Price<br />Instructions to Offeror: Offeror should complete Pricing Sheet for the Base Period and Option Periods.<br />Evaluation Criteria - To evaluate offers for award purposes, the Government will apply the offeror's proposed fixed-prices/rates to the estimated needs for the first year. These prices will be evaluated to determine reasonableness of the price. A comparison of the proposed prices, government estimate, and/or market values will be used.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(x) Offerors are required to complete the FAR provision at 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.

The Offerors proposal must demonstrate reasonable pricing that is aligned with the technical capability.  Price will not receive an adjectival rating.

<DESC>Offerors shall propose IAW the CLIN structure and quantities as provided in the attachment. This requirement is for software maintenance and license renewal of the Niksun Sensors and NetTrident for network monitoring on Army networks world-wide. The Niksun products are needed to satisfy immediate mission maintenance on previously purchased equipment. The Niksuns are highly specialized equipment; deviating from the required product, at this point, would significantly degrade the sustainment and maintenance posture of the equipment in operation.  The impact of maintenance interruption would significantly hinder and prevent the interfacing of systems with other intelligence production and dissemination capabilities. The Niksun hardware monitors all Army networks world-wide and then provides this data to the NetTrident and NetReporter appliance via interface licenses. This maintenance must provide 24/7 coverage, to include software and hardware upgrade versions.  The OCONUS sites are required to return equipment directly to Niksun for repair.  Niksun is the system developer that provided the design, engineering, integration, installation, hardware and software maintenance for Niksun's  systems and is available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract. for maintenance.

The vendor must explain how they will comply with the requirements in the request for quote by submitting a written quote which describes: <br> ROTEM delta analyzer and accessories - Brand Name <br> 1:  The unit shall be, a portable all-in-one Thromboelastometry (TEM) analyzer using the viscoelastic method for haemostasis testing in whole blood. <br> 2:  Must be able to detect both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and test for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. <br>  <br> 3: Must be designed to be a stand alone unit. <br>  <br> 4: The Thromboelastometry (TEM) analyzer shall come in 220 VAC 50 Hz. <br> 5: Must have the following key measurement parameters as a minimum: <br> a)	Clotting time (CT): The CT is the latency time from adding the start reagent to blood until the clot starts to form. Prolongation of CT may be a result of coagulation deficiencies, primarily coagulation factors, or heparin (dependent on the test used).  <br>  <br> b)	Clot formation time (CFT) and alpha-angle: The alpha angle is the angle of tangent between 2 and the curve while CFT is the time from CT until a clot firmness of 20 mm point has been reached. These parameters denote the speed at which a solid clot forms and are primarily influenced by platelet function, but to a certain extent especially fibrinogen and coagulation factors contribute. <br>  <br> c)	Maximilliclot Firmness (MCF):  MCF is the greatest vertical amplitude of the trace. It reflects the absolute strength of the fibrin and platelet clot. <br>  <br> d)	Lysis Index after 30 minutes (LI30) and Maximum Lysis (ML): The LI30 value is the percentage of remaining clot stability in relation to the MCF value at 30 min after CT. A similar value can also be calculated at other time points (45 or 60 min). The ML parameter describes the percentage of lost clot stability (relative to MCF, in %) viewed at any selected timepoint or when the test has been stopped. <br>  <br> e)	AS, A10, Al5 or A20 value: These values describe the clot firmness (or amplitude) obtained after 5, 10, 15 or 20 minutes and provide a forecast on the expected MCF value at an earlier stage. The advantage of the A15-value is obvious: It allows for a more rapid decision about therapeutic intervention. <br>  <br> 6: Must have the following types of assays: <br>  <br> a)  A semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay used to monitor the coagulation process via the intrinsic pathway in citrated whole blood specimens. <br>  <br> b)        A semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay to monitor the coagulation process via the intrinsic pathway in the presence of unfractionated heparin, in citrated whole blood specimens. <br>  <br> c)  A semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay to monitor the coagulation process via the extrinsic pathway in citrated whole blood specimens. <br>  <br> d)  A semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay to monitor the clot firmness of citrated whole blood specimens after blocking platelet contribution to the clot firmness by Cytochalasin D. <br>  <br> e) A semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay to monitor the clot firmness of a citrated whole blood specimen after blocking hyperfibrinolysis by aprotinin.  <br>  <br> f) A semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic assay to monitor the coagulation process, contact-activated by the surface of the measurement cell, in citrated whole blood specimens. <br>  <br> 7:  Corporate capability. The vendor shall submit a written narrative to explain its corporate capability to supply the medical items that the US Government will order. If a vendor offers equal products, vendor shall provide an explanation/narrative to demonstrate why the offered product is equal to the Brand Name. <br> 8:  System for Award Management (SAM). The vendor shall have a current registration in the SAM with updated DUNS and CAGE numbers. <br> 9:  Government Purchase Card (GPC).  The vendor accepts the US Governments GPC as method of payment. <br> Failure to receive an acceptable rating in any of the salient characteristics will result in an unacceptable rating unless the error(s), deficiency (ies) or omission (s) can be corrected. <br> All items on the required items list shall be priced.  If you fail to price all items, your quote will not be submitted for award. <br> Para (c)  Change 30 to 60. <br> Para (d)  Does not apply to this quotation. <br> Para (i)  Does not apply to this quotation. <br> Add the following: <br> Para (m)  Quotes shall describe how your offer meets the salient characteristics of this solicitation.  <br> Para (n)  ELECTRONIC OFFERS.  Vendors may submit electronic quotes in response to this RFQ.  The quote must arrive by the time specified in the RFQ to the following email address: elena.hughes@amedd.army.mil <br> Vendors may call Elena Hughes (+0049) 6371-86-60213 to verify receipt of the quote.  If the vendor chooses to email the quote, the Government will not be responsible for any failure of transmission or receipt of the quote, or any failure of the vendor to verify receipt of the emailed quote. <br> Para (o)  QUESTIONS.  Prospective vendors are strongly encouraged to submit any questions regarding this RFQ two days before closing date of quote submission by e-mail to Fax (+49)6371-86-8070.  All questions received will be answered officially through an amendment for distribution to all prospective vendors. <br>  <br> ACQUISITION PROCEDURE <br> The acquisition procedure to be used for this acquisition will be in accordance with FAR Part 12 and 13 Simplified Acquisition. <br> ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 <br> Paragraph (a) is hereby replaced with the following: <br> (a) The Government will award a purchase order to the responsible quoter whose quote represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made on the basis of the Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br>  <br> (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br>  <br> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br>  <br> (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). ?(The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).) <br>  <br> (1) Listed End Product <br> 	Listed End Product <br>  	Listed Countries of Origin: <br>  	 <br>  	 <br>  	 <br>  	 <br>  	 <br>  	 <br>  <br> (2) Certification. ?(If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.) <br>  <br> (  )(i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. <br>  <br> (  ) (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.

These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.  The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months.  The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days before the contract expires.   <br>  <br> (End of clause) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> 52.217-9    Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2000)  <br>  <br> (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor 30 days prior to contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. <br> (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. <br> (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 54 months. <br>  <br> (End of clause) <br>  <br> 52.219-28    POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2012) <br>  <br> (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- <br>  <br> Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority. <br>  <br> Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. <br>  <br> (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall  represent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: <br>  <br> (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br>  <br> (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br>  <br> (3) For long-term contracts-- <br>  <br> (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and <br>  <br> (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. <br>  <br> (c) The Contractor shall re-represent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards. <br>  <br> (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. <br>  <br> (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. <br>  <br> (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. <br>  <br> (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: <br>  <br> The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code      - assigned to contract number      . <br>  <br> (Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title). <br>  <br> (End of clause) <br>  <br>  <br> 52.252-2      CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)  <br>  <br> This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

It is anticipated that a non-competitive purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to American Eurocopter Corporation as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  

Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(i) warrants;

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200045 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft.  THE SCHEDULE OF LINE ITEMS IS ON A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT.  










It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to American Eurocopter Corporation as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  

Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-<br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;<br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-<br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or<br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and<br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.<br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.<br />(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.<br />(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.<br />(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.<br />(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:<br />(i) warrants;<br />(ii) options;<br />(iii) contracts to acquire stock;<br />(iv) convertible debt instruments; and<br />(v) others similar interests.<br />(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.<br />(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:<br />0 It is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;<br />0 It is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it has submitted a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74, which has not been denied; or<br />0 It is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74.<br />(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Asia/Middle East (AME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Kabul, Afghanistan with extended TDY's to regional military commands. This post is not a family-accompanied post and does not allow minor or adult dependents, although a separate maintenance allowance may be authorized for incumbents with dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.<br /><br />USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) launched its Afghanistan program in July 2009 to address instability at the local level. The mission of OTI-Afghanistan is to improve stability in strategically selected locations by supporting formal and informal Afghan governance structures. Through the Afghanistan Stabilization Initiative (ASI) program, OTI seeks to: improve local perception of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) legitimacy; establish and/or strengthen the link amongst GIRoA, informal governance structures and the local population; and leverage and/or empower community based resiliencies to address sources of instability. To achieve these objectives, OTI incorporates a number of programming principles that emphasize a process-oriented, Afghan-led approach to implementation.<br />OTI-Afghanistan's program works to facilitate community consultation, encourage GIRoA transparency and public outreach, and build Afghan capacity through fast, flexible, and targeted projects. Project activities facilitate local government engagement with communities to address grievances and enhance GIRoA's legitimacy; rehabilitate infrastructure through creation of short-term employment opportunities for which GIRoA is responsible and receives credit; support civic education programs that strengthen the relationship between formal and traditional governance mechanisms; provide technical support to local GIRoA officials and community groups including public outreach and communications training, assessments, surveys, and subject-matter experts; and build GIRoA officials' capacity to design and implement public relations campaigns and community programming following military clearing operations.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below: (1) "Trade Secret" means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities. (2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information. (f) The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error. <BR> <BR>(a) Any system hardware, software, firmware and/or networked component (voice, video or data) developed, procured, or acquired in support and/or performance of this contract shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, processing, forwarding and storing digital information across system boundaries utilizing system packets that are formatted in accordance with commercial standards of Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6) as set forth in the IJSGv6 Profile (KIST Special Publication 500-267) and corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.  All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines.

<p>1. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Human Systems Division (AF LCMC/WNU) is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities and experience to respond to the requirements listed in this document.

This is only an RFI in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.

<DESC>This modification is issued to confirm the response date for this RFI is 5 April 2013, 5:00 pm Central.<br /><br />********************************<br /><br />The Department of the Air Force ("Air Force"), through the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), requests information from interested parties regarding a potential lease of certain real property known as the Malabar Annex situated in Palm Bay, Brevard County, Florida under the control of Patrick Air Force Base (AFB) for the purpose of private commercial use. The Air Force seeks to gather information to fully analyze the leasing opportunity and to better understand questions and concerns of potential participants/lessees. The Air force will use information received in response to this RFI in determining whether to issue a solicitation for the leasing opportunity and developing the content for the solicitation, if any. If the Air Force proceeds with a solicitation, it will then evaluate responses received and may select a "highest ranked offeror" (HRO) with whom to negotiate and enter into a lease agreement. <br />This RFI is issued for planning and information gathering purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a solicitation will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the preparation or submission of information.

<DESC><p>AMENDMENT TO SOLICITATION NOTICE:</p>
<p>The following questions were received by the closing date in response to the notice. Responses are included in italic font immediately following each question. The closing date and time for the notice remains as originally described in Section VI of the notice.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES:<br />1. Does OPM intend for the contractor to utilize OPM's GoLearn platform to deliver the on-line training? <em>No, we would expect to use the vendor's site. </em></p>
<p>2. Has the curriculum for the modules OPM specifies been delivered or does OPM need the contractor to develop them? <em>No, we would expect the content to be already developed by the vendor. </em></p>
<p>3. Does FIS have a single training coordination office to interface with the contractor's program management office? <em>The contractor will deal solely with the designated program manager at FIS' National Training Center office, Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. </em></p>
<p>4. The deliverables mention "unlimited access" to online training and classroom courses. Can you provide more clarity around unlimited? In the case of online training does unlimited mean continuous access to retake a course after it has been taken (1 student unlimited times) or does it mean no cap on students (unlimited students 1 course)? For classroom training does unlimited mean no cap on students but limitations on when the course will be offered? <em>By "unlimited access", we mean that access to the contractor's course offerings, whether live seminar or web-based, is limited by the potential student population already identified. An individual student's access to a single course would be controlled and monitored by the FIS training office: one student's course registration for a single course attendance. For classroom training, the FIS training office would work with the contractor concerning scheduling a course event for a particular number of FIS students or for a FIS student to attend one classroom event at a specific place and time. </em></p>
<p>5. The RFI states submissions are to be made in Microsoft Word. Will you accept submissions in pdf (to reduce file size)? Also is there a maximum file size for electronic submission? <em>The requested format is designed to facilitate OPM's ability to work with the material after submission. In our experience, files up to 5MB can be received. If a vendor's complete package needed to be sent in multiple increments to comply with the file size limit, we would work with the vendor to accept multiple increments in order to receive the complete submission package.</em></p>

<p>Reminder:<br />***Proposals are due no later than 2:00pm EST on February 19, 2013.</p>
<br />________________________________________________________________________<br />The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is hosting a pre-solicitation conference. The purpose of this conference is to provide potential offerors with background information to better understand the Department's requirements. The attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is provided to interested parties for questions and comments.<br /><br />The requirement is as follows:<br />The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is seeking a contractor to provide publications, operations, outreach and dissemination support (PO2DS) to one of its flagship programs, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), for the procurement period FY2013 - FY2018. NAEP is approaching its 45th anniversary as a mature program in a rapidly changing environment. It is incumbent on the program to maintain its historical role of reporting educational progress while at the same time accommodating and taking advantage of unprecedented changes in education and of rapid advances in technology. <br /><br />There are numerous factors that will influence NAEP during this period, many of which will be referenced throughout this Performance Work Statement (PWS). <br /><br />Examples include:<br />&bull; transition from a paper-and-pencil to technology-based assessment,<br />&bull; the emerging interest in international comparisons for states and districts, <br />&bull; advances in test development and new item types,<br />&bull; moving from a paper to an electronic environment, <br />&bull; development of measures of preparedness for post-secondary education and work,<br />&bull; adoption of common content standards by most states that may or may not align with NAEP content frameworks, <br />&bull; development of two separate common state-developed assessments based on those standards,<br />&bull; growth of out-of-school and technology-based learning by students, <br />&bull; growth of web-based reporting and social media, and <br />&bull; budget reductions throughout the education and assessment enterprises.
<p>NCES envisions this contract as vital to supporting a quality assessment and the program's transition to the future. There will have to be balance between the requirements specified herein and the on-going planning for the future of NAEP. NCES has undertaken several activities to develop a vision for NAEP 2020; those activities are documented at http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/future with their own knowledge of the future of large scale assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The pre-solicitation conference will be held as follows:</p>
<p>Date: December 3, 2012 <br />Time: 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time<br />Location: U.S. Department of Education<br />National Center for Education Statistics <br />1990 K Street, NW<br />8th Floor, Conference Room 1<br />Washington DC 20006</p>
<p>Registration is required for the event.</p>
<p>Questions and comments must be provided in writing.</p>
<p>Please email all questions and comments by November 27, 2012, to Scott Frankel, Contract Specialist, Scott.Frankel@ed.gov NLT 12:30 PM Eastern Time. There will be a time for questions and answers at the conference. Questions asked in writing by November 27, 2012, will be answered at the conference; questions asked at the conference will be answered in an addendum to this posting.</p>
<p>Each contractor is required to email a list of attendees from their company by November 30, 2012 to Scott Frankel, Contract Specialist, Scott.Frankel@ed.gov. This list will be used for pre-solicitation conference attendees to gain entry at the security desk of the building. Contractors should bring state or federal issued identification.</p>
<p>There will be a conference call dial in number available for a limited number of participants upon request.</p>

The NPS considers this notice to be an extension of the existing solicitation (#CC-BLRI002-13).
The text that follows is from Solicitation #CC-BLRI002-13, posted on December 20, 2012:
The National Park Service (NPS) has revised a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10-year concession contract to provide craft sales, retail and limited food and beverage services at the Northwest Trading Post (NWTP) within the Blue Ridge Parkway. The NPS has revised the Prospectus to improve the opportunity for potential offerors by reducing the Leasehold Surrender Interest buy-in to $0. 
The NWTP is located at Milepost (MP) 259 on the Parkway, near the town of Glendale Springs, NC, in Ashe County, and is an hour north of the popular resort towns of Boone and Blowing Rock, NC. Since its inception, the NWTP has focused on the sales and promotion of locally produced, mountain-themed handicrafts. Shop offerings include handicrafts such as baskets, pottery, jewelry, quilts, books, souvenirs, and local handmade foodstuff. 
The NPS has determined that the Existing Concessioner is a Preferred Offeror for this Draft Contract pursuant the terms of 36 C.F.R. Part 51. All offers, including that of the Existing Concessioner, must be received by the NPS at the address listed on the inside front cover of the prospectus no later than 4:00 p.m. on February 13, 2013 in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract.  The prospectus describes the business opportunity and includes the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract. 
The prospectus will be available on the NPS website at http://concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm, or you can receive a hard copy for $50.00.  To request a hard copy of the prospectus to be delivered via Federal Express, send a check for $50.00 payable to the National Park Service to Mark Morgan at the address listed below.

<DESC>DHS has a requirement on a sole source basis to extend the interim bridge contract vehicle HSHQDC-12-F-00048 for up to 4 months (4) for critical research and development (R&amp;D) laboratory operations and associated technical support services, specifically explosive detection portfolio in the areas of checkpoint, check bag, air cargo, standoff detection, explosive blast effects, and emerging technologies. The proposed period of performance for this action is February 16, 2013 through April 15, 2013 with two (2) one month options.
<p>The current Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-000048 was awarded on June 1, 2012 for a period of 6 months as a sole source award under DHS LSJ No. 071-12 on an interim measure until such time as the award of a follow-on contract vehicle can be made through full and open competition. Since the expiration of this period of performance, the contract was extended IAW FAR Clause 52.217-8 (Option to Extend Services) beginning on December 1, 2012 through February 15, 2013 and was processed under DHS LSJ No. 005-13 and approved by the OPO Competition Advocate.</p>
<p>The purpose of LSJs 071-12 and 005-13 was to provide TSL with continued contract coverage while a newly competitive contract vehicle could be solicited. On November 23, 2012, OPO issued Request for Quotation HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 under GSA e-Buy. The Solicitation closed on December 21, 2013 and a total of four (4) proposals were received. RFQ HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 includes the research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) services that are presently covered under the interim bridge task order. The estimated milestone timeline for the award of new contract vehicles under the RFQ exceeds the period of performance available on the current task order and it is critical that TSL continue to maintain contract coverage while the RFQ proposal evaluations are underway. The estimated award timeline is March, 2013. For this proposed action, LSJ No. 051-13 has been coordinated and approved by the OPO Competition Advocate.</p>
<p>For this proposed extension, Other Direct Material Costs (ODC) will be required in order to perform the services. In accordance with the requirements of FAR 8.402(f) and competition requirements of FAR Part 6, an open market J&amp;A document has been prepared to cover the ODC portion of this action.</p>
<p>The approved LSJ No. 051-13 and J&amp;A No. 052-13 are attached.</p>

<DESC>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a project underway in Saint Paul-lez-Durance, France (ITER Cadarache site) to construct a device that will demonstrate nuclear fusion power at a powerplant-relevant scale (http://www.iter.org/). Work scope associated with diagnostics systems supplied to ITER by the US is assigned to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a national laboratory operated for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) by Princeton University under Contract No. DE-AC02-09CH11466, and PPPL is responsible for the work described in a Statement of Work (SOW) that will be published as part of the above-referenced PPPL RFP No. 13-031. The RFP SOW will cover a portion of the Low-Field-Side (LFS) Reflectometer system that is one of the diagnostic systems being provided by the US. The LFS X-mode system, reflecting off the upper cutoff, is used to probe the scrape-off layer (SOL) profile. The LFS O-mode system is used to provide the profile in the outboard gradient region. The radial extent of the probed region for each of these systems depends on plasma parameters, the toroidal field, the probing frequency ranges and polarization. It is anticipated that the Supplier selected as a result of this RFP shall form a collaborative team with one or two subcontractors that distributes the tasks described in the RFP SOW. The desired outcome of this solicitation is to award a subcontract to an institution that will lead a LFS Reflectometer collaborative team that has the collective expertise and experience to complete the LFS Reflectometer R&amp;D and design phase and also have the expertise, experience and resources to develop the software and fabricate and deliver the LFS Reflectometer hardware identified in the SOW. The Supplier shall have responsibility for the transmission line performance testing, physics modeling and coupling to support preliminary and final design and specifying and overseeing fabrication and testing of instrumentation able to make fluctuation and profile measurements consistent with measurement requirements. Providing real-time analysis for feedback control shall also be the responsibility of the Supplier. The Supplier selected shall interface directly with each subcontractor and manufacturer to coordinate activities and maintain an effective Quality Assurance Program with implementing procedures to assure compliance with this SOW. PPPL shall be informed of activities and shall have final approval authority with benefit of recommendations of the Supplier. The Supplier shall develop and maintain an overall schedule for the design and production of the equipment including major milestones. It is the intent of PPPL to distribute a Request for Proposals (RFP) to perform the work objectives described in the SOW. The subcontract period of performance for the R&amp;D and preliminary and final design phase will be approximately&nbsp;three years (June 2013 through&nbsp;September 2016). The proposed subcontract to be awarded to the LFS collaborative team will also have an option to award the fabrication phase of the SOW based on the design and requirements approved at the FDR. This announcement is not a solicitation and does not obligate PPPL to issue a solicitation. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should review the draft Statement of Work (SOW) and SOW reference documents. The documents may be accessed and downloaded&nbsp;by clicking on the&nbsp;hypertext link below, then clicking on the link entitled "Procurement Opportunities", and then clicking on the links for RFP No.&nbsp;13-031.&nbsp;Interested parties&nbsp;should&nbsp;submit a statement demonstrating their capabilities to perform this work. Information submitted should describe your organization, personnel, facilities, applicable subcontractor network and past experience to meet specific needs stated above.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in accordance with FAR Part 6 "Competition Requirements", intends to contract without full and open competition a commercial six-month Firm Fixed-Price bridge contract (as prescribed in FAR 6.302-1) with the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), 601 Madison Street - Suite 400, Alexandria, VA for Fingerprint and Photo Processing Services.
<p>This contract supports services for the Recruitment and Hiring Program which requires fingerprints for the pre-employment security background process performed on all TSO (Transportation Security Officer), FAM (Federal Air Marshal), and FFDO (Federal Flight Deck Officer) candidates and contractors seeking employment with TSA. This sole source bridge contract will have a period of performance for six (6) months that will be inclusive of a four (4)&nbsp; month base period and two (2) one month option periods&nbsp;(March 11th, 2013 -September 10, 2013). The estimated cost of this procurement is $250,000.00.</p>
<p>This 6-month bridge contract is needed to allow time for the TSA to negotiate and award a new fingerprinting contract, and once the award is made, the new vendor will have to undergo the C&amp;A (Certification and Accreditation) process and Achieve ATO (Authority to Operate) which is anticipated to be at least 4-6 months before the vendor is fully operational. Without a bridge contract in place, the TSA would undergo a break-in-service which would adversely impact the TSA's ability to support the recruitment and hiring program which requires fingerprints for pre-employment.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.</p>
<p>Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by emailing the points of contact below. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within five days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p align="left">Authority to use a Time and Materials contract</p>
<p align="left">FAR 12.207(b)(l)(ii)(A), 16.60l(d)</p>
<p align="left">FINDINGS</p>
<p>&nbsp;I. The Morris K. and Stewart L. Udall Foundation proposes to contract for administrative consulting services for the Foundation.</p>
<p align="left">The contract amount is NTE $100,000. It is anticipated that no further additional services will be required</p>
<p align="left">2. Market research was conducted to determine access to administrative consulting services in the local area. A solicitation was issued through FedBizOpps and a contract was awarded to the most qualified and best value offeror.</p>
<p align="left">3. The dnration and extent of work needed cannot be accurately anticipated because the services are necessitated by the needs of the Foundation's interim Executive Director and Board of Directors to determine what changes are needed to the organization due to ongoing investigations. Due to the difficulty in defining the scope of work, the costs of the effort cannot be anticipated with any degree of certainty. No other type of contract is suitable for procuring the services of the kind and quantity required without using a Time and Materials contract.</p>
<p align="left">4. The contract is expected to be concluded at the end of the six month performance period and the contract is for a relatively low level of funding. Approximately half of the work will be performed on Foundation premises. The Executive Director will be monitoring performance to limit the risk involved in a Time and Materials contract. A similar contract is not anticipated once the Foundation can implement the consultant's recommendations.</p>
<p align="left">5. The Foundation prefers to use Firm Fixed Price contracts, and expects that there will be limited need for such consulting services in the future. Future work, if needed, will be competed using a firm fixed price contract.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">DETERMINATION</p>
<p>On the basis of the above findings, l hereby determine that no other type of contract other than aTime and Materials contract is suitable for this procurement.</p>
<p align="left">2/12/2013</p>

<DESC><p>1. The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 USC 2304(c) (2) and FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency</p>
<p>2. RRMC's Uninterruptable Power System (UPS)&nbsp;went down in the middle of the night.&nbsp; The system is an Eaton System and the parts that were required could only be purchased from Eaton.&nbsp; The UPS is back up power system in the event the electricity would go out - so the parts needed to be purchased immediatly and replaced to meet RRMC's mission requirements.&nbsp;<br /><br />3. Impact: The effort to contract with full and open competition would cause delays and there is a risk that the URGENT and COMPELLING requirement would not be met. This could result in an adverse result in the event of a LIFE THREATENING emergency.</p>

<DESC>1. The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 USC 2304(c) (2) and FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency
<p>2. The RRMC Uninterpretable Power System (UPS) had a 5 year Preventive Maintenance and Repair&nbsp;contract with En-Net Services that was competitively awarded by the Technology Application Office (TAO).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The base year of the preventive maintenance contract&nbsp;had expired.&nbsp; At this time Contract Support is being provided by Washington Headquarters Services Acquisition Directorate (WHS AD). To ensure there is no interruption in&nbsp;Preventive Maintenance/Repair Service&nbsp;a 6 month bridge contract was administered to En-Net Services to give WHS AD ample time to&nbsp;advertise and competitively award another 5 year contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />3. RRMC has an URGENT and COMPELLING requirement to ensure that we had this continues service.<br /><br />4. Impact: The effort to contract with full and open competition would cause delays and there is a risk that the URGENT and COMPELLING requirement would not be met. This could result in an adverse result in the event of a LIFE THREATENING emergency.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; A new requirement for a 5 year contract will be solicited in the near future.</p>
