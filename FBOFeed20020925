<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends this contract to provide targeted screening to identify potential therapeutic and preventive modalities, as well as resources to characterize additional antimicrobial activities of already licensed antimicrobial agents, small animal and non-human primate models to test the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive modalities that target emerging infectious agents including, Bioterrorism Category A-C agents as outlined in the CDC website http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/Agentlist.asp.  A list of priority organisms is also available on the NIAID website http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm.

The objective of this contract is to provide a range of developmental resources to bring new therapies and preventive measures from the laboratory to initial clinical testing in humans.  The contract consists of six parts, listed below, which each contribute to the overall development effort.  These contracts will provide a ready capacity in a number of needed areas and will be utilized as products become available for testing.  Test articles that are found to have activity in Part A may progress through development using contractors from other parts.  For Parts C, D, E and F, various vaccine concepts may be tested based on the following categories:   (a) synthetic peptides, (b) recombinant subunits, (c) vector based vaccines, (d) virus-like particles/replicons, or (e) nucleic acid based vaccines. The contract will have six (6) parts.

Part A: In Vitro Screens for Antimicrobial Activity.  Part A will provide the capacity to screen test articles for antimicrobial activity against emerging infectious agents including, Bioterrorism Category A-C agents.  Materials for testing will be obtained by NIAID and provided to the contractor for testing.  This contract is not intended to cover antiviral screening against viral hemorrhagic fevers or poxviruses, which is covered by a separate contract.  

Part B: Clinical Isolate Panels for Selected Bacterial Pathogens.  Part B will provide the capacity to perform antimicrobial activity determination against clinical panels of bacterial pathogens to arrive at tentative susceptibility breakpoints. This activity is to be performed using bacterial pathogens classified as emerging infectious agents, including Bioterrorism Category A-C agents.  Antimicrobial agents to be tested under this contract will be selected on the basis of their activity against select genera and species of bacterial pathogens using reference strains. 

Part C: Small Animal Models for Selected Pathogens, including GLP Studies.  Part C will support the development, validation and use of various small animal models to screen new therapeutic, diagnostic and preventive agents or test the efficacy of therapeutics, immunotherapies, diagnostics, and vaccines with activity against emerging infectious agents including, Bioterrorism Category A-C agents.  

Part D:  Non-human Primate Models for Selected Pathogens, including GLP Studies.  Part D will support the development, validation and use of various non-human primate models to screen new therapeutic, diagnostic and preventive agents or test the efficacy of therapeutics, immunotherapies, diagnostics, and vaccines with activity against emerging infectious agents including, Bioterrorism Category A-C agents.  

Part E:  Safety and Immunogenicity Testing for Vaccines.  Part E will support the testing of vaccine preparations as required prior to initial clinical evaluation (under GLP).  This includes testing candidate products for safety and immunogenicity (both cellular and humoral) in small animals and, if appropriate, in non-human primates.

Part F: Safety/Toxicology and Pharmacology Testing for Therapeutics.  Part F will support the testing of candidate products for safety, including reproductive toxicology and other appropriate tests, in small and large animal, and if necessary, in non-human primates.  This activity includes all such tests as are required to support clinical use in humans; testing must be sufficient to meet requirements for IND filing (GLP).
 

It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made for each part of this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) solicitation.  The ordering period of this IDIQ will be in effect for seven (7) years.  An IDIQ contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services to be furnished during a fixed period, with deliveries or performance to be scheduled by the Government placing orders with the contractor.  Task orders will be issued to the pre-qualified pool of contractors for parts A, B, C, D, E or F based on the specific requirements of the task order. The RFP contains at least one actual task for each of these six parts. In response to this RFP, potential Offerors may submit proposals for one or more of the six Parts described above.  For Parts A and B, Offerors should propose as many organisms or groups of organisms as possible.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE 	This is a combined pre-solicitation notice and request for information.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) currently intends to solicit proposals for a contract for development and production of fully militarized microprocessor-based voltage regulators that control generator voltage in both 60 Hz and volts per hertz variable frequency modes onboard CVN 68 Class nuclear aircraft carriers.  The solicitation package is expected to be available on or about 31 October 2002.  Interested companies are advised to monitor http://www.fedbizops.gov/ and/or http://www.neco.navy.mil/ for the availability of the package regardless of whether or not they respond to the RFI contained in this notice.   	The Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) program will replace legacy analog static type voltage regulators currently used on CVN 68 Class Aircraft Carriers.  The c ontract presently being planned calls for FY 03 and FY 04 development of the new regulator with the possibility of options for limited and full rate production units commencing in FY 05.  Development can be modifications to commercial items or non-developmental items to militarize such equipment.  It is NAVSEA's current intent to procure up to a ship set of 4  prototypes to be tested on a ship in mid to late FY 04.  Once the solicitation is released a short turnaround time of 30 days for receipt of proposals is anticipated with planned award occurring  in early 2003. 	All interested companies are invited to express interest to the POCs listed below by either phone, mail, or email no later than 9 October 2002.  Interested parties may also submit information concerning their companys ability to produce a variable frequency voltage regulator with pamphlets or brochures describin g their experience with same or similar shipboard equipment.  Information submitted to NAVSEA as a result of this RFI will not be returned, nor will the government pay for any information received, nor will the government compensate any respondent with costs incurred in developing the information provided.  The Government will not release any information received in response to this RFI and marked with a Proprietary legend, , to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. 	This Pre-solicitation Notice/Request for Information  is in no way to be construed as a commitment by the government for either an RFP or an award.   POCs for the RFI are Franceen George (202) 781-4809, georgefp@navsea.navy.mil; and Jeffrey VanNederynen (202) 781-0916, vannederynenj@navsea.navy.mil.

Because the vendor was not requested to supply the temperature controller as part of the entire system, we are amending the above sentence to read "Stable temperature regulation shall be attainable throughout the operating temperature range." The remainder of the temperature regulation specification remains unchanged.
2.	One of the original required specifications stated "Stainless Steel, braided, flexible hoses for high purity helium shall be 1/4 inch I.D. and 15 feet in length."  The reason for the small diameter is that we need extra flexibility in the lines in the environment where these systems are used. However, we understand that this size hose is smaller than recommended for use with these systems, and that vendors may not have experience with the capabilities of their systems with these hoses in place. We make the following amendment to the solicitation with regard to the performance specifications of the system.

"The performance specifications for the system provided by the vendor, such as cooling power and base temperature, must be met with the vendor-recommended 1/2 inch I.D. hoses for high purity helium. However, the system shall be delivered with 1/4 inch I.D. hoses as described in the solicitation. NIST has in its possession the vendor-recommended hose size and will test the system with these hoses as required to verify system performance."
***All other terms and condtions remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

(17) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial commodity items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The 21st Contracting Squadron is seeking 494 Vehicle Repeaters and all associated hardware to three different Wings to include support, installation and extended warranty. (Malmstrom Air Force Base, Minot Air Force Base, FE Warren Air Force Base.) For Minot AFB, 125 each SVR-200UA, 406-420 MHZ; Malmstrom AFB, 185 each SVR-200VB, 150-174 MHZ; and for FE Warren AFB, 184 each SVR-200VB, 150-174 MHZ. Vehicle repeaters specifications include: (a) In-band repeating. Military radio frequencies are limited to one spectrum band per wing. The SRV-200 must have the ability to repeat within one spectrum band. Established military frequencies of 403-420MHZ and must have a 25kHz and 12.5kHz channel spacing. (b) Product size; the SRV-200 size must be small enough o fit inside the security forces vehicle atop the mounted vehicle radio, allowing the ease of installation and removal. (c) Repeater De-Key and Priority Repeater Function: The repeater must De-Key periodically to check if other repeaters are operating in the same area; if so, the repeater must be able to cease transmissions so multiple repeaters are not over repeating the radio transmission.  The SRV-200 must continue to monitor all radio transmissions even when it is not the priority repeater and take action to become the priority repeater when the absence of a priority repeater is detected.  (d) Minimum Power Output.  The SRV-200 must output less than 2 Watts. It must transfer the transmission to the mobile radio for boosting the signal power and transmission. It is critical when transmission signal strengths have been coordinated between the United States and Canada.  Minot Air Force Base Security Forces operate near the Canadian boarder and signal strengths have already been negotiated.  (e) Interface with existing radio: The SRV-200 interfaces without any modification to existing Security Forces mobile radios.  Standard cabling and wiring is used.  (f) Upward compatible with newer radio technology. The SRV-200 must use the existing radio technology to transfer the signal. It can be used with future radio upgrades without modification.

<DESC>NA THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The U.S. Army is seeking experts to support development of a sensor for buried landmine detection based on the nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) phenomenon.  NQR allows detection of specific explosives in mines and eli minates false alarms from other objects in the ground.  However, the NQR response from a mine is very weak relative to the background RF noise and mitigating that RF noise has been one of the biggest challenges of the Ground Standoff Mine Detection System (GSTAMIDS) program.       The Army has run into some technical problems with the NQR sensor arising from RF noise mostly at the NQR frequencies for TNT, but RDX detection is also an issue.  The TNT frequencies (near 842 kHz) are in the AM radio band.  RDX frequencies are near 3.41 MHz.  The sensor picks up the magnetic-field component of the noise, which can be 20 to 40 dB above thermal noise.  The NQR signal is only about 6 dB above the thermal noise after several seconds of signal averaging.  While the basic dimensions of thi s RF noise problem have been understood since the beginning of the NQR landmine detection project, it has recently become clear that the problem is not well in hand, especially for night time operation with the changed propagation path and increased RF pow er levels after dark in some parts of the world.      Quantum Magnetics, Inc. (QM) has designed a unique kind of gradiometer NQR antenna design to pick up NQR signals from the explosives and RF noise.  For this antenna, the far field rejection ratio is only about 15 dB, but the near field loss is not as great as with a conventional gradiometer.  QM also designed a separate RF noise reference antenna consisting of orthogonal magnetic field coils to pick up only the RF noise.  This approach to RF noise mitigation is complicated because the NQR antenna is pu lsed and rings down, so subtraction of RF noise is difficult during transients.  Furthermore, there is a limit to the number of far-field radiators that can be removed with this remediation.  An added complication is that the coupling coefficients between the RF noise reference antenna and the NQR antenna may change with time, especially at night with the scattering off the ionosphere.  Recent testing resulted in good performance during the day, but poor performance beginning shortly after sunset.  A relate d problem was observed during daytime near an electric power line since it acts like an antenna picking up and re-radiating RF noise.       The Army is putting together a Red Team to take a fresh and in-depth look at this problem of RF noise mitigation..  Specifically, the purpose of this red team is, over the course of several months, to study the RFI problem and the NQR system in depth and devise potential solutions which will lead to improved performance in the field. NVESD is seeking experts around the world in RF noise reduction techniques from academia, government, and industry.  The plan is for the team to meet initially at QM's fac ility in San Diego to obtain the necessary detailed information from QM.  Then, the team acting individually and collectively will develop detailed solutions to the NQR RFI problem. The potential solutions will be reviewed in depth by the red team and the army with the purpose of pursuing the most promising approach or approaches..  The members of the Red Team would report progress monthly to CECOM-NVESD and assemble at QM's facility about every three months to report progress and exchange ideas.      If you think you can assist the Army in solving this challenging problem, please provide information that  fully describes your qualifications to support this effort by 11 October 2002  This information shall be provided via email to peggy.melanson@ca cw.army.mil.  The army will invite red team participants based on their relevant qualifications and with the objective of achieving a balance of technical skills and backgrounds.   All participants will be required by  sign nondisclosure statements and may be reimbursed for travel  associated with this endeavor.   Please direct questions to Peggy Melanson at 703-325-6096.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

<CONTACT>John Walker, Contracting Officer (502) 364-5280
<DESC>The Chief of Naval Operations Director of Surface Warfare (OPNAV N76) has requested the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) undertake a study to address the Surface Warfare (SUW) mission area. The US Navy's growing responsibilities to operate more extensively in the littoral environment affords hostile forces a greater opportunity to engage US and Allied Naval Surface Forces with an array of anti-ship weapons launched from land, sea or air. This increasingly hostile environment requires a thorough evaluation of current and future systems that can successfully defend US Naval Surface Forces against the multitude of threats operating in the littorals.  The objective of the NDIA SUW study is to assess current/planned Fleet SUW capabilities, review other US and Allied assets in the Theater of Operation for applicability to the SUW mission, identify technologies/systems  that may contribute to an improved SUW capability and develop draft documentation pertainent to the creation of a Capstone Requirements Document (CRD) for the Surface Warfare mission area. A study team is being formed to address current and future SUW capabilities from the present out to the year 2020. The NDIA study team comprised of both industry and government representatives will identify operational concepts, overarching capabilities, requirements for the SUW mission area family of systems (FOS)  and the scope of individual systems envisioned to comprise the FOS. The team must identify criteria against which various combinations of systems and contributions of individual systems can be evaluated. The team will conduct analyses using appropriate results and insights from previous assessments, operational experience, lessons learned from deployments, exercises, test and  evaluation, experimentation, technology demonstrations and other sources that can identify capabilities required for the SUW FOS. The team must also identify the factors that drive the timing of the SUW requirements, such as service life of existing systems or expected introduction of new threat operational capabilities. The team must develop a description of the operational capability, threats, scenarios, shortcomings of current systems, and expected capabilities for the SUW FOS. Requirements drafted by the team will have appropriate criteria, rationale for each, and be defined in threshold/objective format along with the top level interface requirements for information exchange and interoperability.      In support of the study effort, OPNAV N76 is soliciting information on ideas, concepts, technologies and systems which may provide potential improvement to the Fleet's abi lity to defeat the surface threats operating in the littorals. OPNAV in conjunction with NDIA is also soliciting volunteers to participate in the SUW study. NDIA has begun organizing the study team and has started to define the study structure, document the threats and scenarios, identify appropriate analysis methods/tools and collect applicable documentation. NDIA is still accepting new study team members who wish to volunteer their time and participate in an effort that can improve the US Fleet's warfighting capability. All prospective volunteers should contact Dave Lassek (study team leader) at phone 763-572-6690, email address dave.lassek@udlp.com or Russ Schuler (study team coordinator) at phone 502-364-5006, email address schulerrl@nswcl.navy.mil to offer their support on the study.  In addition to the request for information on theater combat capability, OPNAV N76 is  also interested in obtaining information on modeling and simulation tools/techniques that could be used to assess the SUW capability of the individual elements, the combat systems or the integrated assets of the entire theater force in successfully defeating the array of surface threats that may be encountered during military operations.    .    To submit information in support of the study, each contributing organization or individual must prepare a synopsis of the item (idea, concept, technology, element or system) that is no more than three pages in length. The synopsis must include a description of the item, an explanation of how the item is expected to improve  current SUW capability, the item's predicted performance factors, the item's dependency on other technologies, systems or elements within the combat system, the potential risk of fielding the item including cost  and schedule implications, and the systems or elements within the current SUW mission area that are expected to be replaced by the item. Only one hard copy of the synopsis should be submitted along with organization contact information (POC phone, fax, email). All synopses must be received no later than close of  business 25 October 2002. Submittals received after that date will not be evaluated. Each organization may submit more than one synopsis. The synopsis can be submitted as classified material up to the SECRET level, unclassified material, company proprietary or unprotected general information. All submittals must be properly marked with the appropriate labels to ensure correct handling of the material. It is recommended that each responding organization  attempt to document the item being submitted in an unclassified, non-proprietary manner to facilitate the synopsis di stribution throughout the study team for evaluation. All submittals should be forwarded to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division, Louisville Detachment, 160 Rochester Drive, Louisville KY 40214 to attention of Russ Schuler. Classified material should be forwarded to the Site Director at the same address and internally marked for attention of Russ Schuler.  It is NDIA's intention to conduct a study team evaluation of the submitted material and identify those items that warrant further consideration for application in the SUW mission area. For those items selected, each submitting organization will be asked to prepare a detailed briefing on the item and  present  the material to the SUW study team during the November (selected presenters to be notified later) team meeting.   This announcement provides no funding for concept development purposes. No additional  written information is available.  No formal BAA, RFP, solicitation or contract will be issued.  Requests for additional written information will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the synopses submitted in response to this announcement for further review or evaluation.

<DESC>Amver, the Automated Mutual-assistance Vessel Rescue System, sponsored by the U.S. Coast Guard, is a unique, computer-based, and voluntary global ship reporting system used worldwide by search and rescue authorities to arrange for assistance to persons in distress at sea.  With Amver, rescue coordinators can identify participating ships in the area of distress and divert the best-suited ship or ships to respond.  

Participating ships send voyage message reports to the Amver center at the Operations Systems Center (OSC) in Martinsburg, W.Va.   Amver?s success is tied directly to the number of merchant vessels regularly reporting their position on a voluntary basis.  The more ships on plot, the greater the chance a ship will be identified near the position of distress.  Once enrolled, ships are required to send sail plans, position reports, deviation reports and arrival reports.  The product of the Amver message reports is called the Amver SURPIC (surface picture).   These positions are predicted by a dead-reckoning calculation provided by the software at the OSC.   The message reports are received at the OSC and if they meet all criteria for auto-validation are directly entered into the Amver database.  Otherwise, the data validation staff must manually correct and enter the reports into the database.  

Currently, the Amver Center receives incoming message traffic from a variety of sources and maintains the data in the central database at the Operations System?s Center.   Ships currently send their message reports via email, sitor, telex, fax, and Inmarsat-C.  In order to expand the communications means by which vessels can submit Amver message reports, to further automate the system, and to eliminate the need for manual entry of reports by the shipmaster,  the Amver program is interested in exploring the concept of Inmarsat ?C polling of assets.      
 
In recent years, a number of companies have developed long range asset tracking using Inmarsat-C polling.  With the advent of this new technology, the U.S. Coast Guard Amver program would like to solicit for vendors who are willing to participate in testing the relay of  their tracked assets (participating Amver vessels)  to the Amver Center in Martinsburg, W.Va.   The relayed messages must be in the International Maritime Organization?s standard message format for Amver message reporting.  The data shall be delivered to a pre-determined email address at the Operations Systems Center in Martinsburg, W.Va.    

Testing will be done at no cost to the government.  

This is not a request for proposal and does not commit the government to award a contract now or in the future.  Interested parties should submit a capability statement not to exceed four pages addressing the areas cited above.  Send all responses to Kathy P. Klein, Contracting Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Operations Systems Center, 600 Coast Guard Drive, Kearneysville, WV, 25430.

Responses must be received by the Close of Business (COB)(approximately 5 PM EDT), on Wednesday, October 16, 2002.  Responses can be sent via e-mail (KKlein@osc.uscg.mil) or faxed to 304/262-5997.  Timely receipt, and confirmation thereof, is the responsibility of the vendor.

<DESC>The National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is considering conducting a study to test the efficacy of an innovative program of clinic-based behavioral interventions on adherence and glycemic control in early and middle adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  The purpose of this announcement is to request Capability Statements from interested small businesses in order to determine, for planning purposes, whether there are any potential responsible small businesses that have the capability to perform the study.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this study is 541720.  Therefore, the small business size status is $6 million in average annual receipts, or less, for the past three years.

Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is a relatively common childhood chronic illness, affecting approximately one child in 600 (LaPorte, Matsushima, & Chang, 1995).  The medical regimen for diabetes is complicated and interferes with everyday life, making adherence difficult and often inadequate for achieving good metabolic control (Mortensen et al., 1997).  Because the extent of lifelong adherence is associated with long-term health outcomes (DCCT, 1993), improvements in daily adherence during adolescence truly matter.  Gradually, early adolescents assume increased responsibility for their regimen at the same time parental involvement declines, but the transition of responsibility from parent to child can be problematic, leading to poor adherence and glycemic control (Allen et al, 1983; Anderson et al., 1990; Anderson et al., 1997; Wysocki et al., 1996).

The objectives of the clinic-based behavioral interventions are to (1) enhance youth motivation for adherence with the therapeutic regimen; (2) increase and improve self-regulation and self-management skills; (3) foster appropriate parenting behavior; and (4) promote effective and satisfactory sharing of responsibilities of parents and youths for the diabetic regimen; and (5) facilitate an effective partnership between the family and the health care team (e.g., physicians and diabetes educators).  The primary research question is "Does providing motivational and self-management behavioral interventions during early adolescence promote improved adherence and glycemic control?"

A sample of early adolescent youth with diabetes and a parent would be recruited to participate in the study.  Family members would provide consent to participate and would be informed about the nature of the research and the potential risks and benefits, interviewed upon recruitment, and followed for two years.  Parent-child dyads would be randomly assigned to the comparison group or the special intervention group, involving interpersonal and mediated intervention components delivered at the clinic and remotely.  Participants would complete computer-based assessments at each clinic visit and would be interviewed at baseline and annually for three years.  Outcomes would include attitudes towards diabetes management, parent and child responsibility for diabetes management tasks, parent-child conflict, level of adherence to the diabetes management regimen, and glycemic control (as measured by HbA1c).

Interested small businesses that believe they have the capabilities necessary to successfully perform this study may submit a Capability Statement to Mr. Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, at the address provided by 1:00 P.M. EDT on October 25, 2002.  Please note that there is no standard form or format for such Capability Statements.  However, at a minimum your submission must clearly provide the following information concerning your organization in an organized manner:  

(1) Experience with randomized behavioral trials involving health care facilities, diabetic youth, and parents, including participant recruitment, informed consent, multiple measures collected repeatedly over time, intervention development, and implementation, and evaluation; 
(2) Established link with a health care facility that provides care to at least 150 patients ages 10-15 with type 1 diabetes;
(3) Experience recruiting and maintaining participation of health care facilities in behavioral research; 
(4) Experience training and supervising research staff;
(5) Experience with computer-based survey administration;  
(6) Experience developing and conducting behavioral interventions for health promotion with early and middle adolescent youth;
(7) Demonstration of financial responsibility and adequate financial resources to perform a contract for this study.

Please be advised there is NO solicitation or Request for Proposal(s) associated with this announcement, therefore, contract proposals will not be considered at this time.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.

<SUBJECT>R -- Multi-State Seat Belt Public Media Campaign
<DESC>In recent years, traffic highway data has shown that the nation's impaired driving problem has worsened; thereby, prompting the Administrator for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to effectuate plans for expanded enforcement mobilizations under its 2002 Click It or Ticket Campaign through calendar year 2003.  The expanded mobilizations will continue to focus on seatbelts; and now, they will address impaired driving, also.  States require technical assistance to develop broadcast advertisements and to plan and place media buys, especially for the new impaired driving mobilizations.  Accordingly, this is a notice of intent that NHTSA plans to negotiate with the incumbent contractor, Greer, Margolis, Mitchell, Burns and Associates (GMMBA), to modify NHTSA Contract Number DTNH22-02-C-09029 to expand its scope of work to include activities associated with the development and implementation of paid media initiatives in support of the impaired driving mobilizations.  Notwithstanding the change in scope, the period of performance for the referenced contract remains unchanged, ie., from March 15, 2002 through March 15, 2003).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  It is anticipated that a modification to the existing Contract will be awarded for this effort.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating their capability, NHTSA intends to negotiate a modification with GMMB, Inc. on a noncompetitive basis for the work described.  The listed procuring office must receive responses within 15 calendar days from date of publication of the notice.

INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: The Office of Community Services (OCS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) intends to issue a contract to a qualified organization to facilitate activities related to the development of a comprehensive campaign aimed to strengthen families and communities through faith-based and community-based institutions. The project will identify, examine and assess ways to promote healthy families and improve the quality of life for low-income individuals in every community across the country. The purpose of this project is to develop a nationwide initiative which will identify specific policy objectives and proposals to address how the country will move forward in addressing issues related to the disintegration of communities -- specifically the breakdown of families in these communities. According to statistics issued by the White House: (1) More than 2 million children have a father or mother in prison or jail; (2) More than half a million children are in foster care, and more than one fifth of those children are awaiting adoption; (3) In 1997, more than one million babies were born to unwed mothers; and (4) More than one out of six American families with children live on an annual income of $17,000 or less. And, while the breakdown of the family in communities across the country has had a destructive impact on our society, it has had a particularly devastating affect on the African American community. In fact, many African American scholars believe that the single most destabilizing factor in society today is the decline of stable and healthy families, which in turn, has had a devastating affect on these communities. Statistically, single-headed households are more likely to suffer higher rates of poverty. In addition, children in these households are more likely to have lower academic achievement and have a higher risk for anti-social behavior. ( <http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/faith-based/)> http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/faith-based/). The decay of the black family in communities across the country has lead to an alarming social crisis, and while many in the African American community have yet to agree with current social policies, there is consensus on the need to strengthen the families in their communities. Thus, within the Administration's faith-based and community-based agenda is the potential to bridge together a consensus in the African American community on issues aimed to strengthen families and communities. Through this collaboration, the OCS will realign federal policies and programs to better mobilize, empower, and expand service providers in areas where breakdowns in the community have been most damaging. OCS must continue to play a prominent role in addressing poverty and social distress if it is to completely heal vulnerable communities. OCS believes that community and faith-based organizations have a unique understanding of the affects of the breakdown of the family on the their populations and communities; however, such institutions have been left out of the debate on how to address and remedy the imperative harms facing families and communities today. OCS believes that such institutions and organizations have vast knowledge and insight that should be exploited as this Administration moves forward in its fight against the further decay of the family in communities across the country. The collaboration of faith-based and community- based organizations and government is important when it comes to stabilizing and strengthening vulnerable communities. Through this contract, a qualified contractor will aid the OCS in formulating a nationwide initiative that will seek to address issues relating to the breakdown of the communities and families. In addition, an advisory broad will be established to assist OCS in developing interventions that may be replicated throughout the country. The purpose of the proposed collaboration will be to assist in building and maintaining a national working group of African American community leaders to effectively promote awareness and sustain a dialogue to promote healthy communities and wholesome families. The approach will be comprehensive addressing all aspects and causes of breakdowns in the family and the community. The purpose of this collaboration is to go beyond stand-alone programs, and to create a connected and coordinated approach that will address all aspects of family dissension and community breakdown. The OCS views convocation of individuals as an important component of its policy formulation, and seeks a contractor who can provide unique insight and innovation as OCS works towards its goals in addressing the breakdown of the family and poverty in our communities. The OCS, jointly with a qualified contractor, will host conferences to bring together various African American churches, pastors, community leaders and other individuals for the purpose of sharing information and strategies to address these vital and pressing issues. The contractor will provide logistical, administrative, technical, communications, and management services to support these events as needed. Primary requirements of this contract will be the development of a national steering committee of selected community leaders, sociologists and other experts to recommend, implement and guide policy decisions aimed to strengthen the family and the community. The contractor will also develop marketing and publicity materials, document information garnered from events in hard copy, and post and distribute collected data. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SERVICES: OCS seeks a contractor with extensive experience with faith-based and community-based organizations, and with a vast knowledge of how government may work in partnership to identify and implement strategies to improve the quality of life for children and families. The intentional collaboration is to stabilize and strengthen vulnerable families and communities. Specifically, the contractor must have a unique understanding of how the deterioration of the family has affected the African American community. Additionally, the contractor must have demonstrated experience in addressing the improvement of health, social, educational and economic conditions of children and families, especially African Americans. In order to facilitate the purposes of this contact, the contractor must have the ability to recruit and form a consortium of individuals to help implement, research and develop the purposes of this contract. The consortium must work together to expand and support this initiative. It is vital that the contractor and the other individuals involved already understand the implications of breakdowns facing communities across the country, including the growing rate of divorce, out of wedlock births, and other family breakdowns facing our communities. The contractor must have a full appreciation of the specific issues facing African American communities. OCS believes that with this collaboration there is the potential to bridge together a consensus in the African American community on issues aimed to strengthen families. For instance, while many in the African American community have yet to agree with current social policies, there is great consensus on the need to strengthen communities through the promotion of healthy families. Thus, any inroads that may be made to reach a consensus in formulating a nationwide policy framework would be a great accomplishment in moving not only ACF's faith-based, community-based and healthy marriage agenda, but also the Administration's agenda as a whole.
