<DESC>Request for Information: PAVE PAWS, BMEWS, and PARCS Radar Systems <br />Agency: Department of the Air Force<br />Office: Air Force Materiel Command<br />Location: ESC - Electronic Systems Center<br /><br />TITLE: Request for Information (RFI) in support of planning/acquisition strategy development for a modernization or replacement of the [PAVE PAWS, BMEWS, and PARCS] radar systems.
<p>This RFI is for planning purposes only. In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research. This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only. Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to pay for the information you provide. Your responses will be treated as information only.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The PAVE Phased Array Warning System (PAWS) radar is a ground-based system that provides United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) is a ground-based system that provides USSTRATCOM and NATO Command and Control System (NCCS) with credible ITW/AA data on all Submarine/Sea-launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs). The PAVE PAWS and BMEWS Beam Steering Unit (BSU), Receiver Exciter (REX), Receiver Beam Former (RBF), Array Group Driver (AGD), Radio Frequency Monitor (RFM), Frequency Time Standard (FTS), and the Corporate Feed (CFD) were built for these five radars in the late 1970's and were upgraded in the 1980's. REX and FTS have already been redesigned and upgraded at Beale, Fylingdales, and Thule, as part of the Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) programs. They will be upgraded at Clear and Cape Cod sites as part of the UEWR programs when they are awarded, with expected completion in 2016-17. UEWR programs have not upgraded the rest of the equipment associated with the array front end. This equipment has been in service without being replaced for over twenty years and is rapidly nearing obsolescence requiring technology refresh. <br />Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS) is a fully-automated, computer controlled, multi-function, phased-array radar system, procured in early 1970's. The PARCS Signal Processing Group (SPG) has received only "band-aid" fixes since the site's Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 1975. The 1960's-era technology used at PARCS is not widely used, and few sources are available for Depot-level repair on failed components. The PARCS Signal Processing Group (SPG) consists of ten cabinets of equipment with hundreds of unique parts. The Signal Processing Group (SPG) is used to generate frequency-modulated pulses for transmission, spectrum inversion, and pulse compression; perform side lobe reduction; and processing of track signals/comparison, multiplexing, and signal conversion. Extensive alignment and maintenance are required to maintain proper signal reception and analog digital conversion.</p>
<p>APPROACH: Currently the government is conducting an analysis of several modernization alternatives and comparative estimates of technical feasibility, performance, risk, and cost associated with the alternatives. <br />In support of this activity, the government is requesting information from interested sources on approaches and possibilities that may be considered for upgrading the system. The information developed will be used by the study team to aid the government in defining its funding needs, technical approaches, and acquisition strategy to modernize or replace the system.<br />&bull; The BMEWS and PAVE PAWS radars will have received significant upgrades to their data processing (DP) &amp; signal processing (SP) subsystems by FY16, this upgrade analysis will focus upon front end modernization and remoting. <br />&bull; PARCS has a different architecture than PAVE PAWS and BMEWS and has not received as extensive backend upgrades, so this system may require more upgrades to its backend processing capabilities to support front end modernization. <br />The fundamental requirements are:<br />- Maintain the overall mission support capabilities of the existing system<br />- Minimization of system downtime during system replacement or modernization<br />- Detecting and tracking objects per the BMEWS and PAVE PAWS Prime Item Development Specification (PIDS) Rev H<br />This information will not be used in any future determinations of contractor capability or compliance with future solicitations. Industry responses can be based on analogy to similar radar programs or developed through work estimates for technology development, system design and development, and production costs. <br />1. Request information on technology related to the upgrade of the Radio Frequency (RF) Front end of the Early Warning Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radars to include hardware, software, and producibility/manufacturability. Desired information includes design maturity Technology Readiness Level (TRL), development funding, and schedule to meet TRL 6, cost estimates (recurring and non-recurring), and similar experience with phased array radar technology. Specific areas of interest include; but are not limited to the following:<br />a. UHF Transmit/Receive solid state module technology. Assume quantities of over 20,000 elements. Include information on packaging and production methods to lower cost, module calibration, and performance (power output, isolation, switching times, noise figure, etc.). Provide the cost drivers associated with the T/R module technology and methods to drive down the cost.<br />b. High Power Amplifiers capable of driving groups of elements (2+). Identify linear output power level, efficiency, and packaging information at UHF band. If development is needed provide information on development funding and schedule. <br />c. Digital receiver technology performance and design maturity. The radars will combine inputs into subarrays which are then fed into a digital receiver. Assume quantities of 150.<br />d. Cost Comparisons between a solid state transmit or receive only module versus a full T/R module. (assume a module includes either transmit or receive capability and compare the cost/maturity of this module with full T/R module)<br />e. Describe your concept for high-level modernizing (in place) of the existing PAVE PAWS/BMEWS/PARCS systems with minimal system downtime. <br />f. Experience on the benefits and risks of open system architecture at the subarray level. Identify specific systems. <br />g. Digital Beam forming processor technology for large array. Identify state of the art signal processing capabilities a new subarray level digital receiver will enable. Assume 80 baseband (I&amp;Q) sub array inputs for processing. Include both hardware and software upgrades. <br />h. Identify maintenance and associated cost benefits that can be realized with new front end hardware based upon current fielded system experience.<br />i. Production learning curve theory and slope as applied to analogous programs.<br />j. Identify risks foreseen in performing radar front end modernization and the steps can be taken to mitigate them. Quantify in terms of cost and schedule. <br />k. Describe any emerging technologies currently under development that may be directly applicable to a modernization effort. <br />l. Necessary modifications to backend processing components required as a result of the proposed front end modification.<br />m. Information (performance, cost, and schedule) on the state of the art in multiband and wideband T/R module technology and relevant experience. Technical challenges/risks and performance merits should be provided.<br />n. Identify the magnitude of software development associated with a new system, how much can be an extension of existing software and the percentage of new algorithm development that is recommended. <br />o. Other technologies not specifically identified above.</p>
<p>2. Information on concepts for remote operations of PARCS, PAVE PAWS and BMEWS radars, except Fylingdales, is also requested. Provide information on approaches to remote operations to at least two command and control centers located in the Continental United States (CONUS). Normal remoting via secure global information grid (GIG). When in high threat levels, remoting of at least missile warning (MW) operations via survivable Military Communication (MILCOM). <br />a. Analyze applicable architectures and recommend the optimum architecture for the remote operations.<br />b. Analyze implementation risks and determine Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) schedule and losses for the government budget process.<br />c. Develop a strategy for the demonstration of the proposed remote operating concept. <br />d. Address exploitation of all sensor data to its fullest potential to support multiple mission needs and users. This would include potential data sharing (read net-centric architecture) with other sensor systems to improve event characterization, report timeliness, tipping and cueing and international cooperation.</p>

<DESC>****ATTENTION****ALL FORMAL COMMUNICATION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION MUST BE DIRECTED TO: Darryl Wright, Contract Specialist, email: darryl.wright2@us.army.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted. The Army Contracting Command-Redstone proposes to award a contract for tactical and non-tactical, Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF)/Commercial Equivalent Equipment (CEE)/Electro-Optics Test Station (EOTS)/Electro-Optics Test Facility (EOTF)/Next Generation Automated Test System (NGATS) Repair and Calibration of Secondary Items for Fiscal Year 2012 through FY 2016, by other than full and open competition to Northrop Grumman Corporation, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL  60008-1098, (Cage Code: 26916).  The new contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)five-year requirements contract, consisting of the repair and calibration items which are planned to be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF).  The repair of tactical and non-tactical Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) will have a maximum ceiling for number of repairs.  The repair and calibration portion of this contract cannot be adequately defined to develop a fixed price as there are various levels of repair required.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Northrop Grumman Corp.  The Government suggest that small business firms, or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with this procurement, make contact with the firm(s) listed.  This acquisition covers potential future requirements for five (5) years; however, this does not preclude the Government from ordering the maximum quantity at any time during the requirements period.  Orders will be issued one or more times as repair and return materialize.   <br>Below is the complete listing of Repair and Calibration items:<br> <br> 	NSN	PART NUMBER/MODEL

<DESC>BLM Invitation for Bids, L12PS00118- Wild Horse and Burro Horse Long Term Holding Request For Proposal (RFP) for the following requirement: Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land.	The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain one or more long-term pastures (LTP) facilities located in the continental United States.  The objective for each LTP facility is to pasture a minimum of 400 up to a maximum of 2000 wild horses/burros. The intent is to provide a pasture (grassland) setting for these animals while they are cared for on private land.    During the first years of this contract the majority of the horses may be younger and older adoptable animals that will be shipped and received on a year-round basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. 		Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP), the BLM anticipates the award of one or more contracts.

The offered properties must be located in the continental United States.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years.  Upon contract award:	The BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility only after the offered property meets the minimum requirements outlined in the contract specifications together with any mitigation or additional requirements identified in the BLM=BFs EA  Shipment of animals to the facility is anticipated to occur within 120-150 calendar days from the date of award.  The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks- Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain a minimum of 400 up to a maximum of 2000 wild horses. The animals are to be grazed in grassland pastures that are capable of producing sufficient standing forage.  The pastures must have sufficient rock and soil type to maintain proper hoof size and shape without trimming.  The pastures shall be capable of producing sufficient standing forage (12 animal unit months of forage per animal) to provide for most of the nutritional requirements of the animals on a yearlong basis.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant.  	Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis.  	Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility. Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, and maintain the facilities in a safe condition. Provide weekly monitoring of the animals to assess their health and determine death loss.   Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  The facilities must be located in the Continental United States.

<CONTACT>Vivian Lucas, Contract Specialist, Phone 3018270359, Email vivian.lucas@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), intends to issue a solicitation to obtain comprehensive information on the sale and marketing of tobacco products in the United States.
<p>This is not a solicitation for proposals. The purpose of this notice is to obtain capability statements regarding the availability and capability of qualified small business sources for the proposed acquisition. &nbsp;Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541613, Marketing Consulting Services.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p><br />The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), which became law on June 22, 2009, gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products to protect public health. In order to achieve its mission to protect the American public from tobacco-related disease and death, the FDA requires comprehensive information on the sale and marketing of tobacco products in the United States.</p>
<p>FDA will use this data to monitor trends in tobacco sales and marketing to both inform the development of polices and regulatory actions and evaluate their impact. To better understand consumer choices and the impact of FDA actions, FDA requires comprehensive data for the full range of tobacco products including cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, e-cigarettes, hookah tobacco, dissolvable tobacco products and tobacco accessories.</p>
<p>The Agency needs to know the size and nature of tobacco product sales in the United States and how these sales change in response to FDA actions. Monitoring consumer purchases of tobacco products is one way to measure the effectiveness of FDA actions to protect the public from tobacco related death and disease. Retail sales scanner data is the most readily available, complete, representative and accurate source for sales information. We also need information on the demographic characteristics of purchasers. Retail sales data will also permit FDA to analyze the cost impact of various policy options and actions. This will permit FDA to balance the costs and public health benefits of current and future efforts to regulate tobacco. In particular, the data will permit analyses that evaluate how current and future policy options could impact tobacco product manufacturers, retailers, distributors, importers or other relevant entities.</p>
<p>In addition to retail sales data, FDA seeks information on tobacco product pricing, promotional activities and advertising expenditures to assess trends in the factors that influencing the sale and consumption of tobacco products. Data on the size and characteristics of tobacco marketing expenditures, including promotion over the Internet and through social media, are important to provide the Agency with the tools needed to develop effective policies and actions to regulate tobacco products.</p>
<p>To carry out the statutory mandate to protect the American public from tobacco related death and disease; FDA must measure the sale and consumption of tobacco products and understand the marketing and promotion methods used to sell tobacco products. The purpose of this project is to provide FDA with access to retail sales and marketing data describing the past, present and future volumes, nature and composition of consumer tobacco purchases.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this&nbsp;award shall be the purchase of desktop access to current and <br />historical datasets of commercially available tobacco products sales data, including pricing and promotional information in a form that can be downloaded by FDA for <br />further analysis using software such as Excel or SAS.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>Data Access:</p>
<p>1) The Contractor shall provide FDA with nationally representative, currently existing, commercially available tobacco products sales data, pricing, and promotional information. Tobacco products include, but are not limited to: cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars, e-cigarettes, hookah tobacco, dissolvable tobacco products, and tobacco accessories. The data should be collected using scientifically sound methodologies. Data should also be in a form that can be downloaded by FDA for further analysis in software such as Excel or SAS. Data should be available by brand, sub-brand, UPC code, and carton, pack or other unit measure.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake, CA intends to procure on a full and open competition basis a Weapons Performance Data Package relating to a 5" Rocket Laser Guidance System.

For proposal purposes, the offeror must request a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) from Steven Shultz at steven.shultz@navy.mil. Upon receipt of the NDA, the Government will provide warhead and rocket motor drawings required for proposal purposes and the demonstration
noted below.

It is the intent of the government to collect performance data and provide range and engineering support for suppliers to demonstrate a 5" Rocket Laser Guided System. 

The contractor provided Guidance System will be demonstrated in a ground launch performed by the Navy at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake.
  

The demonstration will consist of: static test firings to ascertain any degradation in seeker capability based on adjacent missile firings.  Furthermore, the contractors' seeker will be exposed to dynamic test firings on the WD SNORT track to ascertain if the effects of adjacent missile firings are expected to be different under flight conditions.  The Government will not be performing flight testing.  Finally, the Government will be launching three separate full up weapons to assess the minimum and maximum controllable ranges against a static target, in addition to what may best be described as a "heart-of-the envelope" shot against a moving target.  The ground launched test firings will be performed using the MK 24 HE Mod 1 HE Warhead and the MK71 Mod2 rocket motor.
  The duration of the demonstration is estimated to be within a 14 day window.

 Fly-out and weapon/seeker performance data will be captured by the government and each supplier will be given the data from their provided weapons launches. To enable the contractor to accomplish the necessary firings, which establish a full up weapon, the Government will be providing all required assets for weapon build-up, targets/lasers and ranges, labor and analysis to support any aspect of the build up and firing the weapons.  Additionally the Government will provide the contractor with all data from the adjacent test firings and live fire events of the contractor's delivered system.

The Government will make available existing inventory of rocket motors, warheads, fuzes and launchers for testing.
  Additionally, the Government will provide a build up and storage at WD, safety monitors, launch facilities and data capture and no cost analysis of the contractor provided 6 DOF package.  The Government will provide dummy equipment and drawings (i.e. motor, warhead, fuzes) for the contractor's integration efforts in plant.  

The offeror shall deliver a data package, which defines the projected operating envelope of the weapons system.  The data package shall include drawings of the weapon system suitable to support a weapons performance data package.  The data package shall include environmental qualifications with the intent towards future operations on Navy and USMC tactical fixed wing aircraft.
  

Multiple contract awards are planned to obtain weapons performance data.

Specific information to include detailed specifications shall be included in Solicitation N68936-12-R-0062 to be issued and posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about February 8, 2012, to close 30 days after the Request for Proposal issue date.  
Delivery requirements shall be F.O.B. Destination China Lake, CA.  Estimated award is August 2012.
All responsible sources may submit a written quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  All responses shall be submitted in writing to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Attn: S.
 Shultz, 429 E. Bowen Road Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.

The contract will be an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery type contract with provisions for firm fixed price delivery orders.  The contract will have a not-to-exceed CLIN for non-recurring engineering to deal with issues such as obsolescence of components.
  The contract will have a period of performance of four (4) years consisting of a Base year and three twelve month award terms.  The prices for the award terms will be evaluated at time of contract award.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The parts being purchased are slightly modified COTS items manufactured by InterMed Video Technologies of Newtown, Ct.   Inter Med Video is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of these items.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers of LCAC System Upgrade and the SLEP displays and has determined that it is necessary to purchase the same units for the remaining craft.
  This qualification program involved extensive testing to ensure 100 percent compatibility with the display signals of the LCAC systems.  These installed displays are integrated into the display console and craft wiring, and are compatible with the Alarm Monitoring System AMS, Sperry Bridgemaster E Radar, Radar Interface Converter Unit (RICU), Navigation Processor Unit NPU, and Navigation Data Integrator NDI.  Other displays would require craft rewiring, qualification and extensive re-testing.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

These are submitted in either the Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF) or in the Government Master File (GMF) format by NMSC to the National Telecommunication Information Administration (NTIA) where they are voted on by other federal agencies belonging to the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS).  The timely processing of proposals is critical to meeting the emerging spectrum management requirements of the DoN.  To that end establishing spectrum support closer to the warfighter will better anticipate and meet the warfighters spectrum management requirements.
  The services required will provide NMSC with essential field level technical support in the planning, acquisition, retention, protection and effective use of electromagnetic spectrum resources in support operations to the Department of the Navy.

This is a sole source action which will be a nine-month modification to the existing Contract N00189-11-C-Z063 to Odyssey Systems Consulting Group LTD, in response to an effort to extend present services, while a follow-on acquisition is being processed.   Odyssey Systems Consulting Group LTD is the only firm who can supply the required services for the acquisition.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1), and Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a).

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

The Program consists of temporary care (generally, up to 3 hours) that offers children a variety of activities, quiet and active play, indoor and outdoor activities, large and small muscle activities, private/individual time, large group and small group times.  The current maximum capacity at VA Northport is 30 children however; the daily operational capacity is determined by the age of the children, teacher/child ratios, and Veteran needs.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice Only and is for informational market research purposes only to determine the availability of potential qualified contractors.<br>Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. The NAICS code is 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.<br>NAICS code is 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.<br>The U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, Baltimore District, requests interest from contractors interested in performing work on a potential design-bid-build construction solicitation for the estimated price range of more than $10,000,000.  <br><br><br>STATEMENT OF WORK<br><br>National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Campus East (NCE) - Third Floor Build Out at the Tech Center<br>1.0	OBJECTIVE:  The Issued-For-Construction (IFC) package for the NGA Third Floor Build Out of the Technology Center contains completed drawings and specifications for fitting out 29,500 SF room that currently has a bare concrete floor depressed 3' from grade, CMU walls and concrete ceiling with pendant industrial lights. The work will transform this space into a state of the art Data Center with Tier 2 plus reliability and concurrent maintainability with a power density of 150 watts/SF designed around a hot aisle/cold aisle cooling concept. This project will upgrade critical IT infrastructure for NGA, doubling the size of the data center in Springfield, VA.  <br>2.0	SCOPE OF WORK:  Provide and install a fully functional Data Center with Tier 2 plus reliability on the third floor of the NCE Technology Center.  A Tier 2 Data Center guarantees 99.741% availability provided by redundant capacity components and single non-redundant distribution paths serving the site's equipment. The Data Center will have UPS and engine generators with a capacity design of Need plus One (N+1), with a single power path.<br>While this is not a complete listing of the scope requirements, following are some specific features of the Data Center further described within the IFC package:<br>2.1	Installation of a raised access floor with stringers grounded to form an equipotential reference plane for the IT racks (provided as GFE equipment) that the contractor will secure to and ground to this floor.<br><br>2.2	Architectural work includes acoustic ceiling, furred gypsum drywall on existing CMU walls, demountable partitions with integral doors, painting, signage and a thorough cleaning after construction is complete to meet data center standards as specified by the International Organization for Standardization Class 8 in accordance with ISO 1466-1.<br><br>2.3	Mechanical work consists of installation of 50+ Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units, chilled water distribution piping, pre-action sprinkler system, chilled water pumps, ductwork, fans and a hydrogen detection system (for UPS battery rooms) as well as a new cooling tower and chiller in the Central Utility Plant.<br><br>2.4	Electrical work includes Power Distribution Units and Remote Power Panel installation in the new data center and all under floor receptacles to power the computer equipment.  Due to the criticality of this facility each piece of computer equipment is fed from 2 different sources to provide redundancy in case of failure of one source.  The electrical system must be installed with redundancy so that failure on any one component will not cause a failure of the IT equipment.  Additionally, the electrical system involves installation of 2 large Uninterruptable Power System arrays of batteries, new rotary uninterruptable systems, new switchgear, new multi-ended unit substations and bus ducts, lighting and options for up to 3 backup diesel generators located outside the Central Utility Plant.  There are options for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems to be installed on up to 12 generators with a urea tank system to mitigate the waste from the SCR's.  <br><br>2.5	Controls systems work includes expansion of the existing photoelectric fire alarm system. There is an option to replace this with an aspirating laser scanner fire alarm system.  Additionally, an expansion and tie in to the existing building automation system and power monitoring system are in the scope of this project.  It is critical that this be done seamlessly to avoid losing any control and monitoring capability to the existing 24x7, 365 day/year data center.  <br><br>2.6	Telecom work includes installation of a multi level cable tray system and installation of telecom cabling from the existing operational computer room to the new data center.  Access to the existing data center will be severely limited due to operations and all work must be done under security escort. <br><br>2.7	Contractor will need to work in this space under a joint use arrangement with other follow on contractors specifically for IT and security installations.<br><br>3.0	SCHEDULE:  Upon award, the Contractor shall develop a proposed schedule for the completion of all work as described in Section 2.0 above and as further described in the IFC documents.  The schedule shall be developed in accordance with all contract requirements and submitted for review and approval no later than thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).<br>3.1	NGA desired BoD is April 2013. The performance duration will not exceed 14 months (426 calendar days) beyond NTP.<br><br>4.0	SECURITY: <br>4.1	The existing data center is a secure facility located on the 4th floor of the Technology Center and must remain operational 24x7 hours/day, 365 days/year throughout the construction of this project.  Routine outages impacting other areas of the Technology Center or elsewhere on the NGA Campus will NOT BE PERMITTED.  Any outages that must occur will have to be coordinated through an agency outage control board.  This process takes 1 month and is subject to last minute changes due to mission impacts.<br>4.2	This project occurs in an operational Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) so all activities in the project scope will be performed under the supervision of government provided escorts.  Work hours, access to the NGA site, access to the work area will all be restricted and must be coordinated.  These restrictions may include: US workers only, no cellular phones, no cameras, no recording devices, subject to search at any time, inspection of all materials/tools/equipment, pre-coordinated access and approval of any personnel. Utilization of the 'E-Verify' System will likely be required for all personnel & workers accessing the site.<br>5.0	OTHER: The contractor shall conform with the installation policy regarding vehicle and personnel access and any special tenant security requirements.  The contractor shall comply with all requirements for preparation of the Health and Safety plan, in particular, any confined space entry as required as part of this SOW will be conducted per the Health and Safety Plan and applicable Federal, State and Local requirements. <br>The Contractor shall submit documentation to the following office:<br>US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District<br>Belvoir Integrated Program Office<br>6050 1st Street, Building 1444<br>ATTENTION : DREW WHITE<br>Fort Belvoir, VA 22060<br>All data, reports, submissions, and other materials under this delivery order are property of the US Government and shall not be released by the Contractor or his/her affiliates without written approval by the Contracting Officer.  Upon completion of the contract, the Contractor shall provide copies of all documentation and unused project information to the Government for use or disposal as appropriate.<br>6.0	OPTIONS:<br>6.1	Aspirating Laser Scanner Fire Alarm System.<br>6.2	Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Systems<br>7.0	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 14 months (426 calendar days) from award date.<br><br><br>NOTE:   Please note that it is required that your company be registered in the Contractors Central Registration (CCR) System, please see www.ccr.gov for additional information. In addition, this sources sought is not to be construed as a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information solicited or delivered.

1.	INTRODUCTION:
This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the Office of Health Information (OHI).  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.


2.	BACKGROUND:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Enterprise Systems Management (ESM), within the Office of Health Information (OHI), under the general supervision of the VHA Deputy CIO and the ESM Director, works collaboratively with Veterans Health Administration (VHA) business staff to derive accurate and appropriate functional requirements for VHA's information systems.  ESM staff work collaboratively with other OHI components and work closely with VHA Program Offices to garner functional requirements that support the execution of the strategic direction of VHA Program Offices related to information technology.   ESM serves as a gateway between the VHA clinical, business and IT communities, ensuring that business requirements are identified, communicated, understood, and translated into IT investments that meet clinical and business needs. The ESM Office designs, implements, and manages processes used to develop, validate, and prioritize customer IT functional requirements to be included in VHA IT investments and to facilitate customer acceptance testing. ESM works in partnership with the Veterans Affairs Office of Information & Technology to acquire solutions on behalf of VHA's business communities and in representing user interests throughout the IT lifecycle. In addition, ESM manages the overall direction of the VHA business architecture, documents the relationship of the VHA Business Architecture with the VA and Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA), partners with VHA IT users and technical communities to model business processes, and performs analysis for determining process improvements that either stand alone or complement IT system solutions.


3.	OBJECTIVES:
The contractor shall provide Facilitation services as well as Requirements Facilitation services for VHA OHI ESM Information Technology (IT) functional requirements. The Facilitator will coordinate group meetings which may vary from 5 to 60 participants with the average being 20  participants (the approximate group size will be defined on individual Task Order issued against the BPA).  In addition, the contractor shall lead and facilitate group briefings and discussions, enabling focused decision-making; recording discussion content and related facilitation support services; debriefing stakeholders; preparing and providing draft and final reports relating to the IT functional requirements. The Government will define specific tasks and deliverables on individual Task Orders. 

The Contractor shall employ facilitation techniques to establish and maintain effective communication among and between attendees.  The contractor shall provide direct support to the meetings and shall be responsible for preparation and wrap-up activities for the meetings.  The contractor shall be available for planning meetings prior to the specified meeting date on the individual BPA Task Orders and shall report out on the progress and status of the meeting.  The facilitator is responsible for guiding the session participants through various facilitation industry standard techniques and methodologies.

Therefore, the contractor, at their own discretion, will determine the best approach based on the meeting intent and type of participants.   Problem solving visualization tools and real-time collaborative tooling and techniques are preferred, as well as techniques and tools that provide graphical representation of business process.  A list of typical techniques and methodologies is listed below and under the Conducting Stage, Use of Problem-Solving Techniques/Dispute Resolution in the statement of work.

Sources Sought

Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
Office of Health Information
HS 12-89 Section 508 Complicance


1.	INTRODUCTION:
This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the Office of Health Information (OHI).  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.


2.	BACKGROUND:
The VHA Section 508 Office's primary mission is to test eLearning courses for Section 508 compliance before they are placed on the TMS.  The 508 program has yielded impressive gains in operational efficiency and compliance performance over the last 20 months.  These gains, however, are constrained by the lack of Section 508 knowledge and experience among the Dynamically changing workforce.  There is still much to be done to continue this trend, and the key is to continue program development for compliance with Section 508 within the VHA Section 508 Office.  The program operation includes administrative support, compliance monitoring, reporting, providing technical support with remediation and to provide guidance in the way of training and resources so Section 508 violations can be avoided altogether in this very complex and often misunderstood field of accessibility and Section 508. 

As amended, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that their electronic and information technology provides comparable access to both people with and without disabilities whenever an agency develops, procures, maintains, or uses Electronic & Information Technology (E&IT).  Additionally, Sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act protect the rights of Federal employees and qualified persons with disabilities against discrimination in Federal employment and in the receipt of Federal programs, services, or activities.  Violating any of these sections of the Rehabilitation Act carries with it the risk of administrative complaints and Federal lawsuits.  For Section 508 violations, we believe that the potential liability of the agencies can be quite large and may require an agency to repurchase or rebuild an entire IT system that fails to meet the Section 508 standards.   VHA strives to have a strong Section 508 program that meets the legal requirements of Section 508 and that considers the ancillary requirements of Section 501 and 504 as the Department of Veterans Affairs transitions to a new generation of health information.   The Section 508 Program Office requires a multidisciplinary approach with specialized resources to assist in all levels of addressing this regulatory requirement

3.	OBJECTIVES:
The Office of 508 Compliance, within the VHA Office of Health Information (OHI) is seeking services to support and augment an efficient Section 508 program that supports members of the workforce with key roles in the procurement, management, development, and dissemination of accessible electronic products and services.

An in-depth understanding of the provisions of section 508 is required. Advanced technical expertise in identifying and remediating Section 508 violations and providing solutions based on current best practices are essential. Expert knowledge of a variety of assistive technologies, i.e., screen readers, screen magnification software, voice input software and alternative input devices is critical. Proficiency with Microsoft Office Suite, Adobe Professional and Flash, HTML, HTML5 and other common authoring tools with respect to accessibility is a must. Provide assistance with batch file creation, script development and small programming projects as needed to help assistive technology better interface with VA software and computer systems when version changes or deployment necessitates such interventions to ensure access to electronic content.

In addition to the technical skills listed above, administrative support and program management are needed. 

The Section 508 standards established by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) are incorporated into and made part of all VA contracts, solicitations and purchase orders developed to procure Electronic and Information Technology (EIT).  These standards are found in their entirety at http://www.section508.gov .  A printed copy of the standards will be supplied upon request. The contractor shall comply with the technical standards at 36 CFR 1194.21 Software Applications and Operating Systems, 1194.22 Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications, 1194.24 Video and Multimedia Products and 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria.


4.	SUBMITTAL INFORMATION:

The Government will not review any other data, attachments that are in excess to the 15 pages.

OIA CHIO 12-10 MyHealtheVet Program Management Office Support Services


 Introduction:

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified GSA Schedule contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, understand GSA Schedule pricing and discount practices and other market information readily available.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA), is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for the MyHealtheVet Program Management Office Support Services. At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

 Background: 
2.  Background: The Veterans/Consumers Health Informatics Office (V/CHIO) for the My HealtheVet Program Management Office (PMO) requires Program Management Services for the implementation of blue button, secure messaging, release management, portfolio management, program/project lifecycle development business case analyses, alternative analyses, Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Interagency Clinical Informatics Board (ICIB) initiatives, and My HealtheVet initiatives.  My HealtheVet (www.myhealth.va.gov) the VA's on-line Personal Health Record for Veterans. The Veterans/Consumers Health Informatics Office (V/CHIO) is the business owner of My HealtheVet (MHV) through the Clinical Advisory Board (CAB) and Patient Care Services.  V/CHIO's purpose is to work collaboratively with other Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Information and Analytics (OIA) programs, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Program Offices and external government and industry partners to develop, implement and monitor MHV content, services and features in support of health care for Veterans. This includes the coordination of Information Technology (IT) lifecycle management for MHV systems and portfolios. V/CHIO functions as a matrix organization to identify and work through cross cutting issues, and to maximize OIA, VA Program Office, government and industry resources in support of the MHV program.  V/CHIO has major enterprise portfolios supporting VHA requirements, including: 

1.	Performance Evaluation                                                             
2.	Statistics                                                                      
3.	Communications                                                              
4.	Training & Education
5.	Outreach
6.	Health Content
7.	Stakeholder Management
8.	Subject Matter Expert management for Business Requirements, Standards, and Interoperability
9.	Clinical Adoption
10.	Strategic Direction
The need to fully support the Veteran necessitates increased emphasis on the development and deployment of existing and emerging technologies to ensure timely, accurate and complete health care information is available to all staff engaged in the care, treatment and the delivery of healthcare for Veterans.  
V/CHIO defines the relationships and processes to direct and control the My HealtheVet program into a centralized Program Governance Model.  This governance model allows V/CHIO to maximize the MHV program's business value within the VA and to end users while reducing risk. 
The purpose of this model is to provide guidance on Product and IT Governance for the My HealtheVet program and V/CHIO organization. Previous governance models for My HealtheVet have focused either on content development or on the IT development lifecycle, without providing clear guidance on the integration points between the two. The Program Governance model will focus on My HealtheVet as a national product oriented to a unique set of stakeholders, and will incorporate both Product and Information Technology (IT) Governance. 
The Program Management Accountability System requires six-month development interatives.  The My HealtheVet program is currently held to deliver in three-month development interatives.  In order to deliver at a fast-pace and provide a quality product, it is mandated that contracting personnel have a working knowledge of VistA, MHV, National Health Information Network, VA/DoD interoperability initiatives, and Veterans Lifetime Electronic Health Record.
3. 	Scope of Work:    The contractor shall provide Program Management Services to My HealtheVet PMO which includes Program Control, Vision documents, Best Practices, Veteran Focus Group feedback summations, Human Engineering summations, Facilitation of subject matter expert workgroups or retreat, business case analyses, alternative analyses, assistance with requirement validations with subject matter experts for MHV's Secure Messaging, Personal Health Record, Blue Button, Veterans Health Library, Health Risk Appraisal, Blue Button, eBenefits, Enterprise Authentication Gateway, My Recovery Plan, Personal Health Record,VA/DoD Personal Health Record initiatives, National Health Information Network, and Veterans Lifetime Electronic Record., Release Management, and Help Desk Transitioning. The contractor shall provide services to support:

Task 1 -  Program Control
The VHA seeks assistance in defining and managing the My HealtheVet product.  This includes activities such as market analysis, product definition, product strategy planning, and execution.  This will assist VHA in determining short-range and long-range plans for development, implementation, education, and adoption, and will drive performance goals and measurement.  It will also position the MHV Program.
VHA seeks to develop the My HealtheVet product to be a world-class website, providing veterans with a leading, comprehensive, and elegant health portal.  The product planning, strategies and execution need to reflect the powerful vision of this product.  This will provide short-range and long-range plans for development, implementation, education, and adoption, and will drive performance goals and measurement.  Program Management support will also ensure all projects are meeting set objectives.  
The My HealtheVet product has multiple streams of development, operational and maintenance activities.  These complex interactions need to be governed in a concerted way that drives to the product vision.  The contractor will update the MHV governance model, including responsibilities, processes, best practices and standard operating procedures across the product lifecycle using the Rational Unified Process.
The Product Governance Model defines the processes, roles, responsibilities and methods for developing, enhancing and maintaining the MHV product.  This model will evolve as the need for defined process and roles evolves.  The Risk Management Plan defines how all projects and functions in the MHV program will identify report and manage risks.  To ensure the My HealtheVet product maintains a high level of quality, the contractor will implement a defined set of quality assurance activities and measurements via a Quality Assurance Plan that guarantees a quality approach and conformance to all product requirements across the product lifecycle.  This plan includes process, methods, tooling and quality measurements.

<DESC>
This is not a Notice of Solicitation.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) currently uses a customized operating platform called the Network Inventory Optimization Solution (NiOS), provided by Turning Point Global Solutions.  The NiOS solution is a customized operating platform to support circuit and service orders, inventory, billing functions for those services provided through the Networx Contract and FTS2001 as well as Networx billing review, problem resolution, and business process improvement.  The NiOS platform includes support to the Designated Agency Representative (DAR) staff in the development and processing of orders for circuits and related services.  Over the last three years VA has expended $4,756,040.62 in license fees, customizations, and support.  The specific customizations include:  

-	Implementation of ability to place an order for MULTIPLE ANI (telephone number) ranges
-	AHC (Agency Hierarchy Code) Creation/Management Module
-	Extensive reporting capabilities to include filtering on ALL reportable data objects
-	Direct E-bonding interface with AT&T
-	RFQ (Request For Quote) ordering process
-	Ability to edit pricing on an existing order
-	Customized service order workflow, to include field-level roles and Queue Manager roles


Currently VA is seeking information regarding solutions that provide similar capability.  The software is critical to VA and any product purchased must meet the minimum salient characteristics listed below:
"	The system shall have the capability to provide unique reports in the Service Request, Preorder, Order, Inventory, Billing and Administrative modules.    The unique reports required are:  Ordering reports, Billing Reports, Inventory Reports, Notification Reports, System Logging Reports (User Access).
"	The system shall allow users to generate ad hoc reports, giving users the ability to select the unique fields needed for each report.
"	The system shall have the capability to load monthly Networx Verizon, AT&T, and Century Link invoices for the purposes of generating an error report using unique billing algorithms designated by the agency.  The system will use the algorithms to generate the error report on a monthly basis. 
"	The system shall allow designated users (billing analysts) to submit disputes through the system.  
"	The system shall allow designated users to make corrections to inventory and ordering items in the system in order to reconcile the Vendor's billing and inventory with what the Agency ordered. 
"	The system shall allow discretionary controls for users such as contractors who will create orders and disputes on behalf of government personnel, but be restricted from submitting the orders.  
"	The system shall provide an activity queue (work queue) for designated agency representatives to review contractor or field user activities such as price quotes, orders, and disputes.  The system shall allow the designated agency representatives to approve activities within their queue and submit orders and disputes created by other users to Networx vendors. 
"	The system shall allow a user to input price quotes and service orders for all services provided by each telecommunications vendor under the Networx Contract. 
"	The system shall have the ability to change pricing for each vendor per the Networx contract.  In addition, the system must allow for the input of Individual Case Based (ICB) pricing at the price quote level and have the ability to generate annual ICB price changes at the Networx Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) level.
"	The system shall have the ability to provide a consolidated inventory based on the Networx Unique Billing Identifier (UBI) or a consolidated inventory for each of the Networx vendors.  The system shall have functionality to allow a designated user to make corrections in order to reconcile services that were ordered against services billed. 
"	The system shall have a user administration module that gives a designated agency user the capability to assign unique roles for sub-users.  The unique role assignments must include discretionary access functionality at the Account Billing (AB) Code and each of the 28 quadrants of VA hierarchy code.  For example, the ability to restrict a user in a Region, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) or sub office from seeing any information outside of their Region, VISN, or sub office.  Discretionary access capability must include subsets of system modules such as:  the ability for a user to only access price quote generation, the ability for a user to only access price quote approval, the ability for a user to only access billing information, inventory information, ordering information, notification information and so on.  This system shall also have the capability for discretionary hierarchy code access at the module level. 
"	The system shall have the functionality to provide discretionary access controls for multiple contracts.  For example, users ordering services under the Networx Universal contract will not have access or visibility to any of the data users ordering services under local wireless contracts have.
"	The system shall allow a designated agency user (administrator) to add and remove unique menus and alphanumeric selections to the menus in each of the system's modules.  For example, the agency system administrator shall have the ability to add sub features of specific telecommunications services to Additional Data Object (ADO) fields and other fields in the price quote module, the inventory module, the service ordering module and so on.  
"	The system software shall reside on current VA equipment located in Falling Waters and Washington DC, therefore the software shall functional and operate on the following equipment:

"	The system shall allow for Electronic Ordering that provides the ability to convert all voice/data and other vehicle telecommunications Service Requests into service orders that DARS can submit to their suppliers through a variety of electronic ordering mechanisms  and ebonding (for those carriers supporting electronic ordering), as well as support electronic processing of Firm Order Commitment (FOC), Service Order Completion (SOC), and Service Order Completion Notification (SOCN) notices generated by Networx carriers (for those Networx awardees supporting electronic processing of these notices). 
"	The system shall NOT experience any downtime during installation or when transferring information.  
"	The system shall accept electronic invoices from vendors into the software system.
"	The system shall have the ability to input up to 400 Automatic Number Identification (ANI) from Century Link at a time without doing multiple service orders request. 
"	The system shall operate 24 per day, seven days per week.
"	Notifications shall be uploaded into the system via Extensible Markup Language (XML).
"	The system shall have the capability of having a Queue Manager for assigning new services orders request.
"	The system shall have the ability to have an Electronic Request for Quotes and the ability to convert service orders request in service orders.
"	The system shall be able to submit and create Agency Hierarchy Codes (AHC) via electronic interface.  There are over 3000 hierarchy codes housed in the current system.  Any future system must be able to accommodate and manage thousands of AHCs including creation, disablement, and modification, and communicate those changes electronically to 3 or more different vendors.
"	The system shall have the ability to provision all types of telecommunication requests into the application software without any modifications or downtime.
"	The system shall be able to accommodate vendor specific information, such as AT&T's Master Customer Number/Group Revenue Code (MCN/GRC) codes associated with each VA AHC.
"	The system shall be able to support multiple contracts such as wireless, local services, and be able to compare inventory to billing invoices.
"	The system shall be delivered within 10 days after award.
"	The software shall be compatible such that the software can be installed with no downtime.

Based on annual telecommunication expenditures of $50 Million and a five year agreement, license renewals will cost VA approximately $8 Million over the next 10 years, until the system is replaced and no longer in use.  Presently, the Turning Point product license is the only known economical solution to meet the needs of VA.

VA is seeking interested parties that have a comparable solution and can meet the salient characteristics identified above.  Interested parties are requested to submit corporate information, availability of contract vehicles, a capability statement demonstrating a product that can meet the specific requirements identified above, commercially available price information regarding the solution including any customization costs, via email to lino.vera@va.gov no later than 3:00pm Central Time January 25, 2012.  

OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS REQUIREMENT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED, OR REVISED AT ANY TIME.

The statutory authority for this sole-source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as prescribed by FAR 6.302-1.<br><br>Mission Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Fort Gordon, GA intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price award to Applied Biosystems Incorporated, Foster City, CA, IAW FAR 6.302-1 in the amount of $11,056.51.  The justification for the sole source is Applied Biosystems, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor. The equipment is already being utilized and has been validated.

This system currently being utilized by USACIL is extremely proprietary in nature and cannot be maintained by any other service company.  Due to a legitimate need by the customer for this specific product, this item will be procured as a sole-source award directly to Applied Biosystems Inc.

<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE<br />DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference in support of the anticipated release of DARPA-BAA-12-27 for the Fixed Wireless at a Distance (FWAD) program on February 2, 2012 at The Capital Conference Center 3601 Wilson Blvd Arlington, VA. 22201 from 8:30AM to 5:00PM. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the FWAD program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: The objective of the FWAD Program is to provide pervasive communications services to deployed military units.</p>
<p>The Fixed Wireless at a Distance concept provides pervasive, high throughput military communications through a mobility backbone that operates over long distances to provide support for the mobile nodes. FWAD places multiple transmission facilities in protected areas to provide communications to current and future military radio systems and networks</p>
<p>Technologies to increase the range of a fixed site base station will be explored in the FWAD program. Several options are possible including: (a) increasing transmit power or receive sensitivity, (b) increasing base station antenna height, (c) increasing base station antenna gain, (d) space-time coding, and (e) other means. Technology to improve the deployment and operation of fixed infrastructure systems is also sought.</p>
<p>Innovative network architectures enabled by the long range infrastructure that support the efficient sharing of data to, from, and among the members of the military deployment will also be explored. Proposers should take a fresh look at the data sharing requirements and develop a novel concept, architecture, and protocols to support data sharing. A radical departure from existing network approaches is expected.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register no later than January 26, 2012, at the following website: https://wwwschafertmd.com/conference/fwad/pd201202/. Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website. There is no registration fee for attending this conference.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to 100 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization. If the conference is oversubscribed, DARPA may limit attendance to one representative per organization. The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and open to the general public. All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event. Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference. Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request". The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be emailed to: Erik L. Smith, esmith@schafertmd.com, Schafer Corporation, no later than January 26, 2012. Both documents are available for download at the registration website.</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposers' Day.</p>
<p>Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so. Presentations may contain a maximum of 10 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues). Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers' Day Conference should contact Erik L. Smith, esmith@schafertmd.com as soon as possible, but no later than the registration cutoff date for the Proposers' Day Conference.</p>
<p>All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager. The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers' Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance. An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by January 30, 2012. There will be no exceptions to this requirement.</p>
<p>After the conference, there will be an opportunity to meet individually with DARPA Program Manager Mr. Mark Rich. Please contact Erik L. Smith (erik.smith.ctr@darpa.mil), (703) 516-6728 to schedule an individual session.</p>

<DESC>Subject: <br />Fusion UV light system On-site service/repair Sole Source Notice of Intent
<p>Reference Number: <br />NB731040-12-00236</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Special Notice- Notice of Intent</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Materials and Structural Systems Division, intends to negotiate with Fusion UV Light System, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to purchase on-site service/repair.</p>
<p>The NIST SPHERE is a unique device that is used for the artificial ultraviolet (UV) weathering of materials. The ability to independently vary spectral irradiance, mechanical loads, temperature and humidity provides researchers with a high level of flexibility in designing artificial weathering experiments. With essentially continuous operation, preventative maintenance is a necessary requirement. Since we have had this service contract with Fusion UV, our "uptime" has increased from ~80% to ~90%. Now, the times when the SPHERE is off are usually scheduled outages from NIST Plant.</p>
<p>If this request is not approved, "downtime" for the NIST SPHERE will be greatly increased. This will result in experiments that are interrupted and may need to be repeated.</p>
<p>Fusion UV Systems is the sole provider of maintenance and parts for the on-site service contract for Fusion UV Systems VPS/I600 lights. These lights are integral part of the NIST SPHERE UV exposure device. Fusion UV Systems is the only known manufacturer of replacement parts for these lights. Since they are the only manufacturer of these microwave energized arc lamps, their service personnel have specialized training on the servicing of these lights.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 335129 with a Size Standard of 500 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Fusion UV Systems for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Willie Lu at willie.lu@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at willie.lu@nist.gov no later than January 27, 2012 at 2:00 pm Eastern Time.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Kenneth Tomer, Cary, NC 27518, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This request is for Dr. Tomer to finalize existing laboratory research projects and resulting publications related to on-going science performed by the Mass Spectrometry Group as well as assist with the transition of projects to other laboratories. Specifically, Dr. Tomer will provide the following per the Statement of Work: The underlying theme of the Mass Spectrometry Group&acute;s research efforts is the structural characterization of biomolecules involved in the body&acute;s immunological and inflammatory responses to environmental exposures. As the immune system is challenged, a number of different innate and adaptive immunological responses can occur. These responses include complement activation, production of antibodies, regulation of protein levels and activities, and changes in levels of pro- or anti-inflammatory small molecules. Each of these responses is regulated by additional levels of complexity where multiple events occur, including the recruitment of protein partners, synthesis of second messengers, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, and repair of biological damage. The group is especially interested in mass spectrometric-based structural studies of the specific biomolecules involved in these cellular events. To address these questions, the group uses techniques such as nanoscale capillary liquid chromatography, direct analysis of affinity-bound analytes by MALDI/MS, that the group was instrumental in their development. Broadly categorized, these studies include: the characterization of the primary sequence, PTMs, and tertiary structures of relevant proteins, the determination of the recognition surfaces involved in protein:protein interactions, and small molecule quantitation. Specific projects include: structural studies of disease related proteins ,such as A-beta (Alzheimer's Disease) and Protective Antigen (anthrax); autoimmune diseases, such as myositis and Sjogrens; protein damaged by oxidative stress; DNA-repair proteins; HIV protein epitopes recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The MSG also significant efforts to proteomic projects, such as the effect of anthrax lethal toxin on macrophages and cardiac cells, and on focused metabolomics, iespecially arachidonic acid metabolites. Under the timeframe of the proposed order, Dr. Tomer will finalize laboratory work and resulting publications related to the science described above as well as close the laboratory. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 3 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 3 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to Dr. Tomer. The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$7.0 Million. This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12 Commercial Item Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is no solicitation package available. For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source POG for testing
<SOLNBR>M6785412T3014
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) Quantico, VA intends to issue request for quote number M67854-12-T-3014 for 200 each, Protective Overgarments (POG).  A firm fixed price purchase order to Hawk Protection, Inc, 8362 Pine Blvd, Suite 280, Pembroke Pines, FL, 33024 utilizing other than full and open competition procedures as authorized by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and is expected to be awarded no later than March 2012. 

The Marine Corps currently uses the POG (NSN: 8470-01-599-0159) produced by Hawk Protection, Inc. to provide fragmentation protection to the groin, perineum and anus equivalent to the protection provided by full armor vests.  MCSC has a requirement for additional developmental and comparative testing for which quantities were not allotted on the production contract.
   Due to the specific nature of the desired testing and that fact that Hawk is the Original Equipment Manufacturer of the USMC, no other sources are capable of submitting the requested items.

This notice is NOT a request for quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quote to be considered by MCSC no later than 10 days after this notice. This notice of intent represents the only official notice of this contracting action and is not a request for quotes. Any inquiries regarding this notice of intent should be directed to Jennifer Glenn via e-mail at jennifer.glenn@usmc.mil. No phone calls will be accepted.

Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>

Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule. For consultants hired under the General Schedule, the daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate (excluding locality pay) by 2087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. Current General Schedule pay rates may be found on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexGS.asp. The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule.

<p>The daily rate is exclusive of travel and per diem cost which may be added to the allowable consultant's rate.</p>

This report must include, as a minimum: (1) The consultant's name, dates, hours and amounts charged to the contract; (2) the names of the Contractor's staff to which the services are provided; and (3) the result of the subject matter of the consultation.</p>

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 23, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT:  CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:  Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.  The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov.  

Please note that any offer submitted after February 22, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated January 23, 2012 (Refresh #18) and must be submitted through the eOffer system.  Offers received after February 22, 2012 that are submitted on prior versions will not be accepted.  

Effective December 10, 2010, firearm lubricants added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Number  (SIN) 426-4G, Firearms Storage, Securing and Cleaning Equipment; Unloading Stations; Bullet Recovery Systems and Gun Racks must meet the Bio-preferred standard.  Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies.  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification.  For SIN 426-4G (Attachment 5), firearm lubricants must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov.  The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website.   If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification.

This refresh includes the addition of five (5) new SINs for Ancillary Supplies and/or Services: 260-1000, 465-1000, 633-1000, 246-1000, and 426-1000. These SINs may only be offered in conjunction with the offer of a corresponding product SIN. 

Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 246-50; services previously covered under SIN 246-50 are now covered under new SIN 246-1000.

Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 260-98; services previously covered under SIN 260-98 are now covered under new SIN 260-1000.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID-NOI-12035 a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-55 dated January 3, 2012. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a business size standard of 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure a standing order for Britelite Plus on a sole source basis with PerkinElmer Health Sciences. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) Britelite Plus Reporter Gene Assay System, 1000 mL, #6016769, qty-30 cases; (5 per shipment from date of award for 6 months). Britelite Plus is an ultra-sensitive luciferase reporter gene assay system for the quantitation of firefly luciferase expression in mammalian cells. This system is especially suitable for use in 96-, 384-, or 1536-well microplate formats, as in use in the high-throughput environment, because of the short half-life of the reagents. The Britelite Plus is compatible with the luminescence detection technology currently in place with the lab. This technology is used for the detection of other substrates in different applications, so replacing it with another product would be extremely costly and inefficient. Any attempts to change reagents for this particular application at this point would provide results inconsistent with previously gathered data. In addition, the relevance of various projects would be harmed because of the incompatibility of new data with data from previous trial runs; comparison would prove impossible with a change in reagents. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) capability to meet required specifications, 2) price, and 3) delivery. Delivery shall be for 6 months from date of award to Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30.

In order to be considered for an award, an Offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201 (a). By submission of an offer, the Offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective Awardee shall be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov prior to award during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an Offeror ineligible for award.] All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Agency. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on February 7, 2012.

The Portland VA Medical Center located at 3710 SW Veterans Road, Portland, Oregon 97239-2964 has a requirement for an experienced licensed provider to provide services for Sealed Source Removal. The VA's National Health Physics Program (NHPP) requires that radioactive sealed sources (not waste) not used for over 24 months, without future plans for use be disposed of through an appropriate vendor who has the appropriate radioactive materials license for sealed source removal that can take immediate custody of the product. This requirement for sealed source removal is being procured IAW FAR 12.6, entitiled "Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items" as supplemented with additional information in this notice, and FAR 19.501 Set-Asides for Small Business. This is a 100% small business set-aside. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The associated NAICS code is 562910, small business size is $14.0M. Any offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party (broker) shall be deemed technically unacceptable. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order to a small business whose offer is evaluated as the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote and is most advantageous to the Government. The contracting officer will review quotations based on the factors listed in this solicitation and the information furnished by the offeror. Before price is considered, the proposal must meet the technical capabilities. The lowest price of the technically acceptable offer will be awarded the contract. The contracting officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the quote. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this Request for Quote (RFQ), based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. Past performance will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis - the government will award to the lowest bidder who provides a history of successful past performance by providing at least 3, recent and relevant examples of providing the same services as requested in the attached Statement of Work.  In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.

Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number&nbsp; 202-372-3695</p>

<p><strong>H.21 CONSULTANTS<br /></strong>A. Consultant(s) hired to perform under this contract may be compensated at a rate for time actually worked or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task, or at nominal compensation in accordance with the contractor's policies. Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule. For consultants hired under the General Schedule, the daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate (excluding locality pay) by 2087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. Current General Schedule pay rates may be found on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexGS.asp. The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule. The current Senior Level pay schedule may be found at: http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexSES.asp.</p>
<p>The daily rate is exclusive of travel and per diem cost which may be added to the allowable consultant's rate.</p>

This report must include, as a minimum: (1) The consultant's name, dates, hours and amounts charged to the contract; (2) the names of the Contractor's staff to which the services are provided; and (3) the result of the subject matter of the consultation.</p>

<p><strong>H.21 CONSULTANTS<br /></strong>A. Consultant(s) hired to perform under this contract may be compensated at a rate for time actually worked or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task, or at nominal compensation in accordance with the contractor's policies. Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule.

The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule.

<p><strong>H.21 CONSULTANTS<br /></strong>A.&nbsp; Consultant(s) hired to perform under this contract may be compensated at a rate for time actually worked or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task, or at nominal compensation in accordance with the contractor's policies. Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule.

The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule.

<p><strong>H.21 CONSULTANTS<br /><br /></strong>A.&nbsp; Consultant(s) hired to perform under this contract may be compensated at a rate for time actually worked or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task, or at nominal compensation in accordance with the contractor's policies. Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule. For consultants hired under the General Schedule, the daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate (excluding locality pay) by 2087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. Current General Schedule pay rates may be found on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexGS.asp. The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule. The current Senior Level pay schedule may be found at: http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexSES.asp.</p>
<p>The daily rate is exclusive of travel and per diem cost which may be added to the allowable consultant's rate.</p>

This report must include, as a minimum: (1) The consultant's name, dates, hours and amounts charged to the contract; (2) the names of the Contractor's staff to which the services are provided; and (3) the result of the subject matter of the consultation.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;H.21 CONSULTANTS<br /></strong>A.&nbsp; Consultant(s) hired to perform under this contract may be compensated at a rate for time actually worked or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task, or at nominal compensation in accordance with the contractor's policies. Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule. For consultants hired under the General Schedule, the daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate (excluding locality pay) by 2087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. Current General Schedule pay rates may be found on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexGS.asp. The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule. The current Senior Level pay schedule may be found at: http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexSES.asp.</p>
<p>The daily rate is exclusive of travel and per diem cost which may be added to the allowable consultant's rate.</p>

This report must include, as a minimum: (1) The consultant's name, dates, hours and amounts charged to the contract; (2) the names of the Contractor's staff to which the services are provided; and (3) the result of the subject matter of the consultation.</p>

<p>Response:  This IDIQ contract is not considered a follow-on contract in the traditional sense.  It is a follow-on contract to several individual purchase orders and task orders that have been previously awarded to several different contractors.  Because the scope of this IDIQ contract encompasses multiple fields within the Usability &amp; Security field, there is not one contract or order that this contract is considered to be a follow-on to.  Therefore, there are multiple contractors who have and are currently performing work that may be considered within the scope of this contract on other contracts or orders.<br /><br />END OF TEXT.&nbsp;</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

5.4	At the time of each delivery, contractor must provide a legible signed and dated written document that identifies the tank level prior to fill, the level after fill, and the quantity delivered. This document must be counter-signed by the facility representative supervising the delivery.

5.5	Emergency delivery will be provided within 24 hours after receipt of Government notification. Contractor must respond to the facility by either telephone or email within one hour to confirm receipt of emergency notification to ascertain the nature of the emergency. Emergency status is determined by the Government when conditions warrant, such as an actuated main bulk tank low level alarm, imminent alarm condition, or system leak. Failure of the contractor to remain current with agreed delivery schedule and requirements does not constitute an "emergency" for purposes of charging an emergency delivery fee.

6.	Quality Assurance Specifications and Requirements

6.1	All medical gas manufacturers and fillers of medical gases must be registered with FDA as drug manufacturers. All oxygen shall be manufactured, processed, packed, transported, and stored according to FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) regulations, and all labeling shall comply with FDA's labeling regulations (21 CFR Part 201).

6.2	All liquid bulk oxygen delivered under the contract shall be medical-grade and shall meet or exceed the standards cited in the current edition of the United States Pharmacopoeia/National Formulary (U.S. P.).

6.3	A valid certificate of analysis shall be provided with each delivery of liquid oxygen. The certificate shall include, at a minimum:
         a) Supplier's name and complete address
         b) Name of the Product (i.e. Oxygen U.S.P.)
         c) An Air Liquefaction Statement where appropriate
         d) Lot number or other unique identification number
         e) Actual analytical results for full U.S.P. monograph testing. (A statement that only states that the product meets the minimum purity of 99.5%, etc. is not acceptable.)
         f) Test method used to perform the analysis. (A statement such as "Meets U.S.P. specifications" is not acceptable; nor would "Tested via Service" be acceptable since the specific model number is not provided.)
         g) Signature of authorized supplier representative and date.

6.4	Material Safety Data Sheets shall be provided to the facility COTR upon request.

6.5	A copy of all inspection reports shall be provided to the facility COTR upon the completion of any contractor owned or government owned bulk oxygen system inspections that are required by regulation.

6.6	All contractor owned equipment shall be maintained or repaired in
accordance with NFPA 50: Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer

7.	Applicable Regulations & Standards

The following is a list of some of the regulations and standards that are applicable to this contract. The list is not comprehensive, and the contractor is responsible for ensuring that all products, equipment and services provided under the contract are in compliance with applicable Federal, state, and local regulations. If applicable, the editions in effect as of the date of this solicitation are listed. Contractor is responsible for remaining compliant with any future revisions that are effective at the time of contract performance.

Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 & 211 - CGMP regulations for supplying medical grade oxygen.

29 CFR 191 0.104 Applies to the installation of bulk oxygen systems on industrial and institutional consumer premises

49 CFR - Transportation

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

NFPA 50: Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites, 2001 Edition

NFPA 99: Standard for Health Care Facilities, 2005 Edition

U.S.P. 23

Density data and volume measurement equivalents published in Compressed Gas Association Pamphlet No. P-6, titled "Standard Density Data, Atmospheric Gases and Hydrogen," shall be used when necessary to convert measurement of gases from one form to another. For example, the following conversion factor shall apply for conversion from gallons to cubic feet.

Calculation based on data in CGA P-6

1 ft3 liquid 02 = 860.6 ft3 gas (Table 1)
1 ft3 liquid 02 = 7.48052 gal ((Table 2)

Therefore:

7.48052 gal (1 ft3) liquid 02 = 860.6 ft3 gas

1 gal liquid 02 = 860.6 ft3 gas
7.48052

1 gal liquid 02 = 115.05 ft3 gas
or more commonly quoted as 1 gal liquid 02 = 115.1 ft3 gas

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OFDA/OD). The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to the complex emergency in Pakistan, OFDA operates an office headquartered at the USAID Mission in Islamabad, Pakistan which is responsible for overseeing the $112 million portfolio of OFDA funding in Pakistan during fiscal year 2011. The Senior Program Officer is OFDA's principal humanitarian representative in Pakistan and is located in Islamabad. The Senior Program Officer will be responsible for monitoring OFDA programs and reporting on the humanitarian situation in Pakistan. The Senior Program Officer assists the Principal Regional Advisor with assessment and monitoring of existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationship, and facilitation of award management activities.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Senior Program Officer will report to OFDA's Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for South Asia. Under the guidance of the PRA, he/she will coordinate closely with USAID and Embassy staff and exchange information regularly with colleagues covering Pakistan portfolios, as well as with the field and headquarters-based OFDA regional team. This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance. The Senior Program Officer will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Technical Representative or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative for all assigned awards. He/she may supervise up to two Foreign Service Nationals.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of one Senior Program Officer to more effectively monitor OFDA programs and the humanitarian situation in Pakistan.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA Senior Program Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency and disaster risk reduction efforts throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). The Senior Program Officer may assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the region as needed.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, Embassy staff, and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines. The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. government disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.</p>
<p>The Senior Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as one of the principal contact points for OFDA in Pakistan, for humanitarian issues. Coordinate closely with both field and headquarters-based components of OFDA's Regional Team and maintain regular contact with development assistance colleagues in the USAID Mission and/or US Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve a primary role in the development of OFDA's response and disaster risk reduction strategies in the AOR, ensure complementarity between the two strategies, and oversee implementation of each.</p>
<p>&bull; Assess a broad spectrum of emergency conditions to provide recommendations, management oversight, and evaluation of OFDA response programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain regular contact with senior leadership within the humanitarian community and represent USAID and OFDA on humanitarian issues. This will include but is not limited to UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs, U.S. Government personnel, donors, host government authorities, and others on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Travel frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor humanitarian conditions in the AOR, and make strategic recommendations for appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in and report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN-led assessments, and participate actively in the international community response structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in the AOR. Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the Regional Coordinator and other support staff current on response issues. Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Manage all administrative functions at the field office level and coordinate travel for all humanitarian-related visitors, including VIPs.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare agendas and briefings for official U.S. Government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Program Officer will report to OFDA's Principal Regional Advisor for South Asia, located in Bangkok, Thailand, and maintain close coordination with the Disaster Operations Specialist in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined goals and objectives. The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with minimal direction and will exercise independent judgment in responding to humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.

<p><br />The RVSS Upgrade procurement is one element of a broader CBP strategy to rapidly acquire non-developmental (and ideally commercially available) systems to support border protection efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technology combines with other resources and capabilities, notably personnel, infrastructure, and intelligence, to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our border protection efforts.</p>
<p>The RVSS upgrade capability will provide enhanced persistent, wide area surveillance for detection, tracking, identification and classification of illegal entries. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The RVSS Upgrade consists of two parallel activities; (1) upgrade selected RVSS sites with newer capability and (2) install upgraded technology at new sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The currently existing RVSS utilizes multiple color cameras and thermal infrared detection video cameras and ancillary equipment, which are integrated into a remotely controlled system that can monitor and record activity within an Area of Responsibility (AoR) during both daytime and nighttime operations. The RVSS sensor images are transmitted via a dedicated communications sub-system to a Border Patrol Station where the information is processed, displayed, and where the USBP agent can monitor and control the system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Government expects the solicitation to be released via FEDBIZOPS on or about 31 January 2012 and is not seeking proposals from industry at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></p>

Background. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The Department of the Air Force is responsible for organizing, training, equipping, and providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required to enable the conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces.
<p>2. Description.</p>
<p>A. Submissions under ATI BAA with Supplemental Information. This announcement requests submissions under BAA HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA for the basic and applied research associated with an Airborne Weapon Layer (AWL) for the BMDS. MDA and the US Air Force (USAF) request submissions from industry in the areas of (1) airborne sensors, (2) air-launched kinetic interceptors, and/or (3) integrated sensor and interceptor approaches. The sensors, interceptors, and/or integrated approaches will result in end-to-end kill chains on existing or planned USAF combat aircraft, US Navy (USN) combat aircraft, or other innovative platforms. MDA and the Air Force are investigating an AWL that emphasizes engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory (boost and early ascent phases) while also providing capabilities for descent and terminal phase engagements. MDA and the Air Force request performance, cost, and schedule information on an AWL that can support a proof of principle flight demonstration within 3 years in order to determine its relative utility. The demonstration will serve as proof of technological feasibility and provide an assessment of producibility.</p>
<p>B. Concept of Employment. The information below provides a brief overview of expected basing, desired operational employment, and potential involvement of partners. Additional information on the Concept of Employment will be provided at the Industry Days.</p>
<p>(1) AWL capability will be forward based to provide immediate response to emerging crises and potential conflict. AWL capability stationed in the United States will provide Homeland Defense and rapid theater augmentation.</p>
<p>(2) AWL may be integrated in both offensive counterair and defensive counterair operations. Offensive counterair using AWL would likely focus on integration within attack operations packages. Defensive counterair operations would likely focus on engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory, but would also include area defense and point defense of critical assets. Offensive counterair and defensive counterair capabilities are to be provided in the context of their associated operational altitudes and positions. For more information on counterair operations, refer to Joint Publication 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats, 5 Feb 07 found here: www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_01.pdf. <br /><br />(3) AWL will be tasked to quickly integrate with air and naval forces to gain operational advantage over the adversary.</p>
<p>(4) AWL may conduct operations using decentralized execution with engagement authority delegated to the individual fire unit (platform operator). Delegation would be consistent with the rules of engagement, defended asset lists, and platform position depending on other missions assigned and maneuvers for self-defense.</p>
<p>(5) AWL will also transmit and receive data including situational awareness, sensor cues, and fire control solutions with other air, space, land, and maritime air defense assets using normal communication/data link and air defense networks. Integrated fire control engagements may occur based on AWL formation tasking, or they may be directed by engagement authorities outside the formation.</p>
<p>(6) AWL should be considered for Allies and multi-national partners through international armament cooperation.</p>
<p>C. Major AWL Components. Respondents should consider:</p>
<p>(1) Platform. Potential platform options include current or future fighters, bombers, or remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). For submission preparation purposes, respondents may use F-15C, F-35A, B-1B, MQ-9, and/or others as a baseline for their reply; however, innovative concepts using other platforms are encouraged.</p>
<p>(2) Sensors and Integrated Sensor Approaches. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should address the following functions: detect, track, target, and provide/support a valid fire control solution, state vector, and covariance at extended ranges from the ballistic missile launch site. Both organic and networked concepts will be considered. Sensor capability should support the full range of interceptor capabilities without degrading aircraft performance beyond that of current targeting pods on aircraft. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should also provide capabilities for engagements against multiple ballistic missiles, warheads, and/or reentry vehicles with capability for basic classification/typing and discrimination. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches may introduce new equipment, modify existing equipment, or integrate combinations of new, modified, and existing equipment to include radars, infrared search and track systems, targeting pods, etc. Modifications to existing equipment should not adversely affect primary mission functions of the platform.</p>
<p>(3) Interceptors. Interceptors should be compatible for carriage and employment across all speeds and G loadings for USAF fighters, bombers, and unmanned aircraft systems. Interceptors may be carried internally or externally on fighters, bombers, or RPVs. Interceptors for internal carriage should be sized and shaped to fit within an F-35A internal weapons bay without interfering with other internal weapons carriage and employment. Options that can be integrated on multiple platforms are desirable over single-platform concepts. Interceptors may also be compatible with carriage and employment from USN combat aircraft. Interceptors should be capable of engaging basic and complex ballistic missile threats. Interceptors may take an incremental development approach that provides an interim capability enroute to final capability. Final production interceptors should also meet insensitive munitions requirements. Interceptors should be compatible with carriage and employment from existing air-to-air and/or air-to-ground weapons stations on fighter, bomber, or RPV to the maximum extent practical. Unique equipment required for carriage and employment of interceptors shall be included in the interceptor reply.</p>

<DESC>The Request for Information (RFI) is posted as a follow on to RFI N68335-11-RFI-7100.
<p>This RFI is identical to N68335-12-RFI-7104 which has been simultaneously posted under PSC Code 17 (Aircraft launching, landing &amp; ground handling equipment).</p>
<p>This RFI pertains to the integration requirement for this effort. RFI N68335-12-RFI-7101 and its identical simultaneous posting N68335-12-RFI-7102 pertain to logistics and are posted separate from this posting.</p>
<p>NAVAIR is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties currently capable of developing a Sustainment Lighting Program (SLP), as a prime system integrator for an improved Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Lighting System that will provide the US Marine Corps (USMC) with Vertical Landing (VTOL), Intermediate Phase (24-72 hrs) and Semi-Permanent Phase (72 hrs+) Lighting. SLP must address a wide range of operational challenges within the expeditionary environments including the increase in state of the art lighting solutions for intensity in order to reduce power needs as well as wireless control. NAVAIR acknowledges that there most likely will not be a single solution within industry and the solution would then come several industry players teaming under that prime system integrator. This teaming concept would be encouraged if it were advantageous to fielding SLP expeditiously while meeting requirements. Experience with the DOD acquisition process and Systems Engineering process that accompany are highly viewed and will make it easier. Broad industry participation is desired but NAVAIR is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production. Delivery of a capability within six years would be required and within less than five years is highly desirable. To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2015 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), NAVAIR requires current industry sources and capabilities information.<br />1. PURPOSE: This notice is part of Government Market Research, a process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this Request for Information (RFI) are to identify responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed SLP requirements. For the purpose of this RFI, the term "proven" means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) "6" or higher, preferably TRL "7" or higher that have been validated in their relevant or operational environment. Examples would be testing in a high fidelity laboratory which emulates the expeditionary (where Marines deploy) environment or actual system prototype testing in any expeditionary environment.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: The mission of the NAVAIR EAF program is to equip the Marine Corps to support Naval Aviation with the flexibility and capability to rapidly deploy and establish survivable, self-sustaining airfields in austere, expeditionary operating environments. The EAF Concept is a shore-based, aviation weapons support system which permits deployment of landing force aircraft within effective range of ground forces. This concept allows for the construction of portable, reusable, forward-deployed airfields that can be assembled in a building block concept for the rapid introduction of air power. The EAF family of systems supports a myriad of airfield configurations, ranging in size and complexity from single-aircraft vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) sites, to short runways for tactical aircraft, to extended runways for heavy cargo lift, through the deployment of airfield surfacing systems, expeditionary arresting gear, airfield terminal guidance systems and airfield lighting and marking systems.<br />The Sustainment Lighting Program (SLP) replaces the existing Legacy Hard-Wire Lighting System in the Marine Wing Support Squadrons of the Marine Aircraft Wing. The SLP will be employed to support flight operations at expeditionary/captured/host nation airfields. The SLP shall provide capabilities for permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps and shall provide VFR and CAT I IFR. The SLP shall be a lightweight system with a minimal logistical footprint, and can be scalable, easily employed and maintained while taking advantage of energy efficient technology. The lighting system shall be scalable to allow for various operating runway lengths, taxiways and parking areas and meteorological conditions.</p>
<p><br />4. OPERATIONAL CONCEPT: The SLP systems must operate with the EAF system as described above. There are a wide range of missions and operational situations in which the EAF system shall operate. Three mission concepts are provided below as representative of the range and scope of EAF implementation:<br /><br />&bull; Mission: Support VTOL sites and Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARP) operations. The system can be installed and retrograded by two EAF Marines.<br />&bull; Mission: Support AM2, bare-based and host-nation airfields or Tactical Landing Zones (TLZ) up to 4,000 ft. The system can be installed and retrograded by six EAF Marines.<br />&bull; Mission: Support Category I IFR AM2, bare-base and host-nation airfields or Tactical Landing Zones (TLZ) up to 6,000 ft. The system can be installed and retrograded by ten EAF Marines.<br />These missions shall be used to establish the physical context in which the SLP systems shall operate. This physical context shall help define the external interface required of the SLP to meet performance objectives. A VTOL Pad lighting system shall interface with the aircraft and surfacing system. A short term austere airfield for limited operations shall have additional external interfaces including maintenance personnel, airfield control and USMC mobile transport interfaces. The largest and most demanding over time is the Category I IFR airfield. Its elements are expanded interfaces including arresting gear and terminal guidance systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. REQUIREMENTS: Following general, unclassified system requirements are applicable:</p>
<p>The SLP shall be part of the EAF family of systems within the Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS) of the Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW). Depending on mission and environment, the current MWSS EAF lighting includes tactical, intermediate and semi-permanent systems per MCWP 3-21.1. A man-portable lighting system (0-24 hours) supports smaller short-term lighting requirements (tactical system), the Minimum Operating Strip Lighting System (MOSLS) provides a mid-term lighting capability (24-72 hours-intermediate system) and the semi-permanent Legacy Hard-Wire Lighting System (72 hours and beyond) provides capability for long term application. These latter two system capabilities, along with the added ability to provide long-term autonomous perimeter lighting for remote VTOL sites shall be incorporated in the SLP. <br />Components of the SLP shall be employed to support both Visual (VFR) and Instrumented (IFR, Category I) flight operations at expeditionary/captured/host nation airfields throughout the world. The SLP shall include a number of different illumination sources as required to support runway, taxiway, approach, signage and obstruction applications. The illumination sources shall be sized to meet the respective application, and the composition of lighting components shall be scalable to allow for various operating runway lengths, taxiway and parking area sizes and meteorological conditions. The SLP shall have a minimal logistical footprint, be easily employed and maintained in an expeditionary environment, take advantage of energy efficient technologies, and include organic power sources to allow sustained operation.<br />Applicable components shall withstand the heat signature of all US/NATO Aircraft (F-35B and MV-22), be compatible with all image intensification Night Vision Devices (NVD) systems (US and NATO), and be capable of remote control by both pilots and local EAF operators.</p>
<p>7.

<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAVAIR Lakehurst's USMC Expeditionary Airfield Sustainment Lighting Program (SLP) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking integrated solutions to supply materials, tools and equipment for the management and operation of US Marine Corps expeditionary airfields located throughout world in current and future Areas Of Responsibility (AOR)'s. This initiative will also support Contingency Operations, Training, Exercises, and Humanitarian Relief efforts in the US and throughout the AOR's. The objective for this initiative is supporting the customer by ensuring reduced cycle times, achieving the best pricing available utilizing commercial business practices, and structuring processes to ensure maximum oversight, reducing administrative burden and increasing customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INITIATIVE OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Sustainment Lighting Program is one of the four systems of USMC Expeditionary Airfields supporting the forward deployed Marine. The Government is requesting input from industry, to determine the potential for a Long Term Contract in support of the Marine Corps expeditionary airfield operations, specifically the SLP.</p>
<p>Projected Scope of Work:</p>
<p>&bull; Supply Chain Management &rarr; Develop and maintain an active and continually evolving state of the art supplier base</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Distribution and Warehousing &rarr; Utilize transportation infrastructure to support geographic locations throughout the world to support EAF Marines</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Quality Control &rarr; insure all products tendered meet the appropriate recognized national and industry standards regarding inspection, testing, grading, marking and general quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Customer Direct Support &rarr; Ensure all products delivered to ordering activities comply with the description of products requested by the customer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Data Management &rarr; Utilize a management System that is compatible with industry and government systems</p>
<p><br />Item Selection &rarr; Any item required by the ordering activity to support construction and routine maintenance of EAF Airfields. In general, the scope includes Sustainment Lighting for EAF Airfields materials and other supplies, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#61607; Electrical products (generators, wire, connectors, sockets, outlets, lights, etc.)</p>
<p>&#61607; Tools of various kinds</p>
<p>&#61607; Communication devices (such as walkie-talkies, two-way radios, etc. used by the maintenance personnel).</p>
<p>&#61607; Contractors should be able to supply the entire product types listed above, as well as various other immediate need maintenance and repair items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Non-routine Type Items &rarr; Items that might not routinely be used in the operations arena, but for reasons within the discretion of the ordering activity, the ordering activity has determined to use such supplies to meet its requirements. Example: temporary storage containers required to support construction of airfields, training or exercises. The intended purpose for their use will place such containers within the scope of this initiative.</p>

<DESC>A10 Wings have experienced negative issues with lesser quality bushings in the past which resulted in production down time and wasted funding. The A10 Structural Engineers authorized the best possible process and specified the use of FTI materials and tooling to ensure one-time installation and reduce flow days and failure rates. FTI uses the science of cold expansion to reduce installation flow-time instead of the usual shrink-fit or press-fit method. The use of ForecMate bushings results in high interference fit which provides for greater resistance to rotation or push out. No cryogenic materials are required so there is no moisture trapped to cause corrosion. No other providers are currently qualified to provide these particular ForceMate Bushings to the current specification. Fatigue Technology Inc. is the original manufacturer and fabricator for these particular ForceMate Bushings. The designs are proprietary designs of Fatigue Technology Inc. and therefore Fatigue Technology Inc. is the Sole Source provider for this requirement. These particular ForecMate bushings are required to be used in the A10 Wing panel hole repair process in accordance with T.O. 16C1-30-10-3 which calls for FTI ForceMate bushings specifically authorized by the Structural Engineers via AFMC Form 202 OO-MAB-2011-02278 and Memorandum referencing Engineering Disposition for A-10/ALL Wings Splice Fitting ForceMate Bushings

<DESC>The Indian Health Service (IHS), Alaska Area Native Health Service has an existing contract with The Alaska Children's Alliance, Chugiak, Alaska, awarded on a sole source basis, following publication of the required JOFOC in the Federal Business Opportunities. The funding for this contract was provided to the IHS, through an Interagency Agreement, by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office for Victims of Crimes, to address the need in rural Alaska for an increase in services to crime victims in remote Alaska communities and villages by improving data sharing, providing transportation to victims requiring treatment and enhancing skills development through training and technical assistance. One of the fundamental principles of the Agreement between the IHS and the DOJ, was to enable victims of crime, especially child victims of sexual and physical abuse to receive culturally appropriate services. Since rural populations are predominately Alaska Native and the IHS has established relationships with the rural communities and villages, the IHS was considered the appropriate Federal Agency to assure the purpose of the appropriation was fulfilled. This existing Interagency Agreement, which has a performance period through August 31, 2013, requires the funding to be dedicated to specific tasks (1) to coordinate with local crime victim service agencies and provide transportation for victims of crime to receive appropriate mental, physical and behavioral health services,(2) to support the Alaska Children's Alliance Child Advocacy Centers Tele-cam Peer Review and Consultation System, (3) to provide training to improve victim services and address the needs of underserved communities in Alaska and (4) enhance the support of established Child Advocacy Centers in Alaska. The initial contract to fulfill the requirements of the Interagency Agreement was awarded to The Alaska Children's Alliance, a non-profit coalition of established and developing children's advocacy centers. This entity has multi-disciplinary teams and child protection teams dedicated to improving community responses to child mistreatment. The Alaska Children's Alliance is a state chapter of the National Children's Alliance which has been developed to support and provide responses to and treatment of child abuse. Their Child Advocacy Centers provide child friendly environments that allow law enforcement, child protection workers, prosecutors, medical providers, tribal representatives and others to work together when there are allegations of child abuse. Referrals come from a variety of sources including the Alaska Children's Services, law enforcement agencies and medical providers throughout Alaska. The basic premise for the sole source award was the fact the Alaska Children's Advocacy Centers are already established and provide evaluations, forensic interviews which are videotaped and monitored by members of the team and medical exams and support for the children and their families. As outlined in the initial JOFOC published in the Federal Business Opportunities there is no other known source for these specific services to be provided in rural Alaska communities and villages. These services are vitally necessary because Alaska continues to have very high rates of child abuse and neglect, particularly sexual abuse. Child maltreatment is strongly linked to juvenile and adult crime and has also been shown to be a major contributor to poor adult physical and mental health. There is substantial evidence and documentation to show children are less fearful when investigations are conducted by Children's Advocacy Centers and parents are more satisfied. The initial contract with the Alaska Children's Alliance provided for forensic photography equipment and training for the tele-cam peer review and consultation system used by providers throughout rural Alaska and provided funding for speakers at a rural based Alaska Child Maltreatment Conference.
<p>The IHS intends to modify the existing contract with the Alaska Children's Alliance to provide an additional $166,971.00 which will be used for (1) continuing tele-cam services for crime victims, (2) develop a rural outreach curriculum to include a template and training demonstrating the process which occurs when a family and victim comes to a Child Advocacy Center, (3) increase the number of medical providers trained in pediatric abuse examinations, (4) develop culturally and regionally suitable training and technical assistance for communities on the north slope of Alaska which will improve their response to child sexual abuse, (5) provide pediatric medical exam training, and (6) provide north slope communities with technical assistance in the development of a Child Advocacy Center.</p>
<p>Subpart 6.3 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation prescribes policies and procedures and identifies the statutory authority for contracting without providing for full and open competition. The proposed modification to the existing contract with the Alaska Children's Alliance will provide additional funding to the contractor within scope of the existing contract and in accordance with the intention of the funding appropriation. The contract modification will be awarded pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1, as authorized by Title 41 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) which provides for an agency to acquire services on a non-competitive basis when only one source is known to be able to satisfy the agency requirements. There is no other know source which has the capability to provide the needed services. Alaska is a vast, geographically isolated state which has one of the highest rates of substantiated child abuse in the nation, especially among Alaska Native children. There are currently 226 recognized Alaska Native Tribes for which the IHS has the responsibility to provide healthcare services which are provided by a statewide network of hospitals and clinics which are predominately managed by tribal organizations under Public Law 93-638, The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended. This contract is supplementing the services provided by this network of facilities and addressing the high rate of child sexual abuse and neglect. The IHS, Alaska Area Native Health Service knowledge of the resources to support child abuse in rural Alaska is sufficient to know there is no other entity which has the existing structure to provide the necessary services. The Alaska Children's Alliance is already part of the established network of providers, facilities and law enforcement. The medical evaluation for possible child abuse is complex and challenging and medical providers who perform these evaluation require specialized training and expertise. Most rural Alaska communities and villages do not have providers with the training and background required to qualify as specialized consultants. The continuation and increased funding of the contract with The Alaska Children's Alliance will help to evaluate and improve the quality of medical diagnosis and treatment when there is child maltreatment, including sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect.</p>
