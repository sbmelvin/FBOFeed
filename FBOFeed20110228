<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Acquisition and Grants, Sacramento Branch intends to contract on a sole-source basis with Telonics, Inc. of Mesa, AZ for approximately Q100 model LPT-145 satellite telemetry transmitters with pressure transducer intended for remote deployment (via crossbow or jab stick) on Pacific walruses.  The transmitters will be fit with attachment anchors provided by the USGS.  The transmitters must be capable of:1)	Remote deployment on walruses without the use of immobilizing chemicals;2)	Enduring physical shocks of remote deployment and daily wear on free-ranging walruses inhabiting ice bearing waters and coastal haulouts;3)	Acquiring walrus haulout and foraging behavior records based on hourly on-board processing of conductivity and pressure transducer sensor data as specified by USGS (hauled out = 1 if more than 90% of conductivity readings indicate a dry state; and forage = 1 if more than 50% of pressure readings indicate a depth of 10m or deeper);4)	Producing transmissions that may be relayed through the Argos satellite data collection system that encode a message containing 119 hours of accumulated behavior data, a low voltage indicator, and a check sum;5)	Producing a minimum transmission power of 0.5 watts;6)	Achieving a mean minimal functional longevity of 7 weeks with a daily duty cycle of 12 hours on and a 60 second transmission interval; and7)	Being fit with a mechanism that allows activation of the transmitter under arctic field conditions.To enable remote deployment of transmitters units shall not exceed 140g mass and shall be configured to accept a deployment mechanism that may be propelled by a crossbow (or jab stick) and to be securely fit to a standard USGS sub-dermal anchor.  To ensure secure attachment to target walruses, the units must be securely fit with a standard USGS walrus anchor.  To ensure optimal battery reserves for each deployment, USGS requires that units be built in small batches in the months prior to planned deployment expeditions.  The proposed action will be a firm-fixed price contract for commercial items (Telonics model LPT-145, slightly modified), and may awarded on a sole-source basis under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items, section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501(a).  Telonics, Inc. is the only known source capable of manufacturing transmitters that meet the requirements described above.  After award, as required by FAR 13.501(a)(1)(iii), the full justification and approval document for this proposed sole-source action will be made available for public inspection.Other interested sources may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer via email at jcaravelli@usgs.gov for the purposes of determining whether competitive opportunities exist.  Capabilities statements must specifically address the requirements described above and demonstrate existing product that meets these requirements capable of being delivered not later than 01 July 2011.  Capabilities statements must be transmitted not later than close of business local time Friday, 11 March 2011 to be considered for this immediate acquisition.NAICS 334220, PSC 5820.

<DESC>This is a special notice open to U.S. industry requesting information on developing an analysis framework for hybrid and lighter than air (LTA) configurations. Hybrid and LTA aircraft could potentially provide capability improvements in the area of mobility. These vehicles could be designed for low or high altitudes, although sustained high altitude flight has been challenging to achieve.
<p>The models could be empirically based or physics based, depending on the amount of data and relevance to the configuration being analyzed. There is a limited historical database for very large airships, and not many exist today, so model validation for certain configurations may be challenging. AFRL is interested in using the model to map technology impacts to key variables, many of which will be outlined in the model components section.</p>
<p>AFRL is interested in a framework that utilizes a modular approach, which will allow AFRL to choose which components of the model operate, and replace or upgrade components to vary fidelity or check different methods. A modular approach to building this framework will give it the ability to grow and evolve with future development.</p>
<p>The following are notional analysis components. This list is not expected to be all-inclusive, and arrangement of components may vary depending on the modeling approach. <br /><br />Aerodynamics - Loads, lift: buoyant and dynamic, drag, side force, moments<br />Structures - Weights, loads, stresses and strains, material properties<br />Propulsion - Power, variation with speed and altitude<br />Stability and Control - Trim, control power required, distributed propulsion <br />Subsystems -Masses (gases, structure, virtual), inertias, power, size; Landing gear / cushions, gas management<br />Payloads - Cargo or sensors<br />Mission sizing and performance - Mission profile, hover, payload onload / offload, weight control, atmospheric modeling</p>
<p>This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.</p>

<DESC>C4ISR Mission Command Common Computing Platform,<BR>Family of <BR>Market Survey Questionnaire<BR><BR>The Army's modernization effort of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) has introduced a multitude of new and improved Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) equipments that will enhance the soldier's ability to plan, monitor, communicate and execute the mission.  Each C4ISR system designed their own unique hardware to meet its stated operational requirement / mission.  Installation of these C4ISR systems into command and control vehicles has become difficult due to space restrictions.  Multiple Processors, Displays, Input/Output devices and installations kits within a command vehicle has reached the saturation point.  The Size, Weight, Power and overall Cost (SWAP-C) involved with duplication of computing hardware for all these C4ISR systems is a major concern.  <BR><BR>To alleviate these concerns, the Government intends to procure a common computing system that will be shared by multiple C4ISR programs / applications.  The objective of this Request For Information (RFI) is to canvas industry to obtain feedback regarding the Government's requirement for a C4ISR Mission Command Common Computing Platform (MC3P).   It cannot be overstated that the government is looking for a low cost common computing system that will address the MC3P requirements.  The MC3P can be a combination of one or more computers /components making up the system to address the increasing levels of computing complexity.  This can then logically translate to a family of computers sharing the same common baseline. <BR><BR>The Government envisions a Family of MC3P computers; initial notional thoughts are there will be three capability levels of computers: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.  All three MC3P computer variants' would support the initial realization of the Mounted Computing Environment as well as be communications/transport agnostic.  The relative quantities or percentages of Basic, Intermediate and Advanced computer systems are on the order of 80%, 15%, and 5% respectively.  Initial fielding quantities are for 3 BCT's.  It is not the Government's intention to replace all fielded FBCB2 JV-5 computers with MC3P's but instead to enhance the BCT's for mission specific requirements detailed below.  Additionally it should be noted that any resulting contract vehicle for the MC3P may be used to fulfill the follow-on computer requirements for PM FBCB2 either JBC-P or re-fresh. Requirements or capabilities for the three variants are described below. <BR><BR>1. The family of computing and display hardware must provide general purpose computing resources in both a mounted and dismounted configuration to host, execute, and meet the hardware requirements of one or more software applications and/or application suites running simultaneously that will provide a variety of capabilities. The family of computing hardware will host capabilities including, but not limited to:<BR><BR>a. Situational Awareness / C2 / Battle Command - including current applications like JBC-P, TIGR, CPOF, MTS (or JBC-P Log), AFATDS/FOS, and DCGS-A (analyst workstation); and future applications to be developed.  <BR><BR>b. Sensor data processing and display including display of current combat platform sensor feeds such as driver's viewers, 360 degree situation awareness cameras, shot detection systems such as Boomerang, the LRAS3, CLOE, CBRN sensors, Mounted Soldier System (MSS) Helmet Mounted Display and combat vehicle mounted FLIR sensors.  The capability will include reduction of GPS devices on vehicles, north seeking modules or Inertial Navigation Systems for the purpose of internal processing or distribution to other on board systems. The capability must allow growth for additional sensors yet to be developed.<BR><BR>c. On-board Platform Network Management - including control of combat net radios, routing of data between terrestrial and SATCOM radios (e.g. BFT 2 & WIN-T PoP/SNE), network monitoring, enterprise services integration (e.g. AD, PKI, Radius, HBSS), cross-banding between two different networks, MSS cordless communications and SWAP/space-claim deconfliction (e.g., the proposed system must be capable of routing multiple voice formats (analog, serial, VoIP).<BR><BR>2. The family of computing and display hardware will host software and/or software applications based on the capabilities required of the leader in accordance with his/her role.   Below are Example categories of the potential capabilities:<BR><BR><BR>a. Basic Capability: Junior NCO leaders - C2/SA mounted platform running JBC-P/MTS/FOS and platform integration of SW, radio controls, one display and user input device, and organic on-board sensors.<BR><BR>b. Intermediate Capability: Junior/mid-grade staff officers and senior NCO leaders - C2/SA with dismountable capability platform running JBC-P and platform integration of SW, radio controls and cross-banding between different networks, multiple security enclaves, network/node management, enterprise services, routing between terrestrial and SATCOM radios, two displays and user input devices for select platforms (one for Infantry dismounts), and organic on-board sensors.<BR><BR>c. Advanced Capability: Commanders and Mnvr S3 leaders -  C2/SA with dismountable capability platform running JBC-P/TIGR/CPOF/DCGS-A (analyst workstation)/ AFATDS and platform integration of SW, multiple security enclaves, network management, enterprise services, radio controls, routing between terrestrial and SATCOM radios, cross-banding between different networks, two displays for Co Cdrs (one for JBC-P and one for CPOF/TIGR) & four displays and user input devices for BCT and Bn Cdrs (one for JBC-P for the TC, and 3 for maneuver, fires and Intel staff), and organic on-board sensors. In addition the capability to receive and view off-board sensor data from UAS or other yet to be determined sensors.<BR><BR>If industry has an alternative capability approach to the above example then suggest it be provided along with basis and rationale.   <BR><BR>3. To the maximum extent possible, the family of computing hardware must allow for the receipt and processing of sensor data from a variety of sensor platforms both on-board and off-board the mobile platforms.  Any cross domain solution necessary to accept sensor data may be implemented internally or externally to the computing hardware itself.  Any external solution would still be considered part of the family of computing hardware.<BR><BR>4. The family of computing hardware will not be expected to host and execute software that is considered real-time and/or safety-critical.<BR><BR>5. To the extent possible the family of computers should look to take full advantage of Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) savings opportunities.  The MC3P computer should comply with the SWAP requirements for the FBCB2 JV5 computer.    <BR><BR>6. To the extent possible and feasible, the family of common computer hardware should be implemented using a modular approach so as to allow flexibility of the hardware to meet the capabilities required of the leader as per his/her role.<BR><BR>7. To the maximum extent possible, the family of computing hardware should be designed to allow for incremental upgrades to increase computing resources (e.g. CPU, RAM, storage) as technologies mature.<BR><BR>8. The family of computing hardware should be designed with reasonable spare computing resources (e.g. CPU, RAM, GPU, storage) to accommodate additional future capabilities without the need to upgrade components.<BR><BR>9. The family of computing hardware must be ready to begin fielding by 1QFY13. An incremental approach may be required to support all use cases.<BR><BR>10. It is the Government's desire for the Basic MC3P hardware system unit production cost goal to be less than $10K in procurement quantities of 10,000 per year.  Total procurement may be as high as 100,000 units worldwide.<BR><BR>11. The MC3P System platform must be capable of operating on Army tactical ground vehicles, tracked and wheeled.  Essentially the MC3P hardware must meet at a minimum the same environmental requirements as the FBCB2 JV5 computer.  This specification is available for review as part of this RFI.<BR><BR>12. The MC3P System Display must have an internal touch screen capability and be fully sunlight readable in bright sunshine, with brightness level that is gradually adjustable from full brightness to total blackout conditions for night time operations.<BR><BR>13. The contractor must provide the US Government with the necessary documentation and Government purpose data rights for the MC3P Family of Computing Hardware equipment sufficient for one or more alternate suppliers to build equipment that will be fully compatible with the MC3P.<BR><BR>14. It is desired that the MC3P architecture be based upon adequately mature commercial technology to enable a short first article prove out cycle and production lead time such that the Government can procure and field this capability beginning in 1QFY13.  Incremental approaches will be evaluated also.<BR><BR>Acronym List:<BR>C2:  Command and Control<BR>SA: Situational Awareness<BR>FBCB2: Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below<BR>JBC-P:  Joint Battle Command - Platform<BR>TIGR: Tactical Ground Reporting<BR>CPOF: Command Post of the Future<BR>MTS: Movement Tracking System<BR>AFATDS/FOS: Advanced Field Artillery Target Designation System / Forward Observer System<BR>DCGS-A: Distributed Common Ground System- Army<BR>LRAS3: Long-Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System<BR>CLOE: Common Logistics Operating Environment<BR>CBRN: Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear<BR>FLIR: Forward Looking Infrared Radar<BR>GPS/PNT: Global Positioning System / Position Navigation & Timing<BR>SATCOM: Satellite Communications<BR>BFT-2:  Blue Force Tracking -2<BR>WIN-T PoP/SNE: Warfighter Information Network, Point of Presence / Solider Network Extension<BR>MSS: Mounted Soldier System<BR>CPU: Central Processing Unit<BR>RAM: Random Access Memory<BR>GPU: Graphics Processing Unit<BR><BR><BR>Vendor Questionnaire<BR><BR>The intent of this questionnaire is to organize vendor responses to this RFI.

<DESC>The FAA intends to award a single source contract to Gallium Visual Systems Inc located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
CAMI (AAM-520) has a requirement for supporting Common Automation Platform (CAP) research, the lab equipment needs to be modified to include the extended capability to simulate CAP prototype displays.  The CAP research plan requires that a minimal set of pre-existing requirements (requirements for en route displays, TRACON displays, and NextGen Big Airspace displays) be collected and used to create an initial prototype display.  This display will be tested and evaluated by controller subject matter experts who will then provide suggestions for how the prototype can be improved.  The prototype will be improved in this way across an iterative process.  A high fidelity simulation will be needed to help maintain the focus of controller subject matter experts on the functionality of the displays and not on any field capability that the simulator may lack.  
The FAA contemplates awarding a contract with a period of performance of 1 April 2011 through 1 December 2011 to fulfill this requirement.   The total estimated dollar value is $747,780.  
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Gallium Visual Systems Inc, Oklahoma City, OK, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
Gallium is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and maintains sole ownership of the Software Code and Hardware Interface.  The Government has limited rights to the source code and is not able to use the data to compete the requirement.  Purchasing the data rights is not in the best interest of the Government because it is unreasonable and the technology is enhanced and upgraded continually which further increasing the costs of the data rights to well beyond those of the commercial technology. 
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions or inquiries resulting from this announcement shall be addressed to Donna Jenkins, Contracting Officer, at (405) 954-0693 or email donna.jenkins@faa.gov.
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for NASA GlennResearch Centers (GRC) Human Research Program (HRP) Imaging Integration Team.	NASAseeks to develop a flexible, programmable, software-based medical ultrasound system insupport of future flight research on the International Space Station (ISS).  TheGovernment is seeking an ultrasound provider to develop and deliver a system with alargely software-based architecture so that a group of NASA-funded Investigators may codetheir advanced algorithms on a common system and conduct on-orbit research.  The systemmay also augment Investigators seeking clinical scanning capabilities above what iscurrently manifested or planned on the ISS.  Accommodating these Investigators in asingle flight demonstration on ISS will address numerous risks across the HRP and advancethe technology readiness level (TRL) of NASAs investment in human research andultrasound in support of future Exploration missions.The ultrasound system sought by the Government would have the following salientcharacteristics:-	Able to support numerous clinical ultrasound modalities.  Clinical modalitiesinclude A-Mode, B-Mode, M-Mode, Doppler modes (pulsed and continuous wave Doppler, ColorDoppler, Power Doppler, Tissue Doppler), harmonic imaging, 2D and 3D Imaging at aminimum.  -	Able to perform imaging in the following areas:  echocardiography, abdominal,small parts and soft tissue, thoracic , vascular, ophthalmic, musculoskeletal,trans-cranial, gynecological and urological.-	Able to support non-clinical, therapeutic uses of ultrasound, includingQuantitative Ultrasound (QUS), Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS), High IntensityFocused Ultrasound (HIFU).  The ability to deliver acoustic power density levels beyondFDA-approved limits for clinical imaging is required.-	Software-based ultrasound system with a well-documented Applications ProgrammerInterface (API) and Software Development Kit (SDK).  User-developed code would controlbeam-forming, scanning, timing, acoustic power levels, data acquisition, processing andanalysis.  Non-clinical QUS, LUPIS and HIFU techniques would be implemented inuser-developed code.  Access to the raw ultrasound data by the user-developed code is anessential feature, as is full control of the ultrasound beam-forming by theuser-developed code.  Clinical modalities would be implemented in either vendor-supplied(preferred) or user-developed code.-	User code would be developed on standard personal computers under a Windows,MacOS or Linux development environment and easily ported to the flight ultrasoundsystems computer host.  Platform-independence for user code development is a significantbenefit to the Government.-	The ultrasound Vendor would work with the GRC flight hardware integrationContractor to repackage their commercial system into a new package that is capable ofmeeting the interface requirements of the Human Research Facility (HRF) aboard the ISSand NASA standards for flight hardware and software development.  The HRF is describedhere: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/HRF-1.html 	  -	The ultrasound front-end (i.e., probe interface, amplifiers, transceivers, D/Aconverters) hardware may or may not reside in a different package than the computer hostwhere the user-developed code resides. -	The ultrasound Vendor would fully disclose the technical details of theultrasound front-end and the software architecture to the flight hardware Contractor toensure that NASA technical requirements are met.  This might include proprietaryinformation, and the flight hardware Contractor would sign a non-disclosure agreementwith the Vendor regarding any proprietary information.-	The ultrasound front-end and computer host must eventually meet the ISS ionizingradiation environment.	The ultrasound Vendor would be expected to deliver a commercialsystem to GRC for radiation testing before the final award of the flight hardwaredevelopment contract is made.  As such, this is a two-phase procurement.  The first phasewill identify candidate systems that meet the performance requirements, and the secondphase will result in a down-selection to a single Vendor for the flight hardwaredevelopment, based on radiation testing results.-	Since this system is considered to be a NASA flight research instrument, FDAclearance and/or approval for the device are not required.No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements areinvited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Allresponses should be provided in MS Word documents or Adobe PDF format via electronicmedia.	Technical questions should be directed to:  Mr. William K. Thompson (216)433-2638.  Procurement related questions should be directed to:  Ms. Debbie Giavasis(216) 433-5420.Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business;average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether theyare large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; - address andphone number).	Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-typeproduct.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as acommitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemedfully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement."The primary goal of this NIEHS project will be use of NextGen sequencing technologies to create a high resolution map of the mouse liver methylome from three different mouse stains. These strains show dramatically different incidences of spontaneous liver tumors. A major premise of this project is that the variable cancer incidence among these mouse strains may be due in part to cytosine methylation in critical tumor suppressor genes and other regulatory regions of the genome that affect associated pathways for liver cancer susceptibility and its heritability across generations. A NextGen Sequencing Support Contract will provide for the following: 1) NextGen DNA sequencing services, and 2) supplementary targeted studies for follow up on generated genomic data. Subsequent studies may examine chemical-induced changes in DNA methylation at target genomic sites that could include complementary studies in global protein and metabolite expression. all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p><strong>Background</strong>. The methylome is an individual's genome wide pattern of cytosine methylation. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification of the genome that plays a major role in development, toxicity and disease. Methylation occurs on cytosines of CpG dinucleotides, a large proportion of which are methylated in mammals. Clusters of unmethylated CpGs or &lsquo;CpG islands' are often found at the 5'-regulatory regions of many genes. These CpGs may become hypermethylated to mediate transcriptional silencing which often occurs in many cancers to downregulate tumor suppressor gene expression or promote pathways in tumor development. Many synthetic and natural chemical undergo 2 year exposure studies in rodents for carcinogenic activity for which a series of genetic and possible epigenetic alterations likely contribute to malignant transformation. However, many basic questions remain about epigenetic variation in contributing to disease relative to environmental chemical exposure.</p>
<p>Recent developments in high throughput or &lsquo;NextGen' DNA sequencing technologies now enable sufficiently rapid genome-wide determination of cytosine methylation, DNA sequence variation, and RNA sequence at base pair resolution. Accumulation of sequence reads in each sample permits sufficient redundancy for accurate base pair assignment to a genome (DNA-Seq) or transcriptome (DNA-Seq). Determination of methylated DNA sites can be accomplished by chemical conversion of unmodified cytosines to thymidine with bisulfite, followed by genomic DNA sequencing. Two parental strains C57BL/6N and C3H/HeN and their F1 hybrid offspring (B6C3F1/N) show very different incidences in spontaneous liver tumors in long term bioassay tests. Determination of the methylome assisted by sequencing of their respective genomes and transcriptomes would provide great insight into the underlying process of tumorigenesis. Confirmation of observed methylated sites can be performed by differential methylation restriction digest or affinity capture to enrich methylated DNA sequences followed by high throughput sequencing and bioinformatic data mining for a targeted interrogation of genomic regions of interest. A provision for metabolomics or proteomic analytical capabilities are intended to provide a targeted level of resources to complement NextGen sequencing data.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong>. The major objectives of this contract are to use NextGen Sequencing technologies to perform the following: 1) define the mouse methylome linked to the genomic sequence and gene expression data of three mouse strains, and 2) perform supplementary studies for a limited follow up validation on genomic methylation and expression data in these mouse strains. Such subsequent studies may examine chemical-induced changes in DNA methylation at target genomic sites that could include complementary studies in global protein and metabolite expression.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements</strong>. Samples for NextGen sequencing and other studies will be on three strains of mouse liver. Liver samples from all mice in this project will be collected and flash frozen by NIEHS. All sequencing libraries will be prepared by NIEHS with appropriate quality metrics. The offeror will provide NextGen sequencing capabilities of paired end reads that will be primarily performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument. Additional proteomic and metabolomic technology platforms proposed by the offeror are intended to complement and extend results from the primary DNA sequencing efforts. DNA sequencing data generated by the contractor shall be regularly sent electronically to NIEHS for permanent storage and analysis. The project will proceed in three phases. The first and second phases will involve NextGen DNA sequencing of each strain to define the genome by DNA-Seq technologies. RNA-Seq analysis for gene expression will be performed upon liver RNA to determine the liver transcriptome. BIS-DNA-Seq will be performed upon libraries constructed from bisulfite reduced DNA isolated from each liver for measurement of site-specific methylation of DNA,. These two phases will consist of 15-20 liver samples over a period of two years. In third phase of study, any additional replicates or targeted re-sequencing to validate specific methylation sites will be performed. Validation of specific methylated CpG sites would be performed sequencing libraries formed after methylation specific restriction enzyme digestions. Furthermore, there may be the need for longer read DNA-Seq using Roche 454 sequence instruments to ensure contiguous sequence data over highly repetitive genomic regions. The degree of required sequence coverage for each of the three sequencing strategies will be guided by results and bioformatic analysis. It isanticipated that 15-20 fold coverage will be needed for DNA-Seq, DNA-Seq and BisDNA-Seq. The provision of metabolomics or proteomic analytical capabilities are intended to provide a targeted level of resources to complement NextGen sequencing data. Metabolomics will primarily be an NMR based platform but may include liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Proteomics will be mass spectrometry-based platforms for protein quantitation and identification. It is anticipated that NextGen Sequencing and supportive analysis by metabolomics/proteomics would be provided by using instruments and resources of one facility or research institution under one contract. NIEHS will furnish the biological samples for analysis. No equipment or supplies will be furnished by NIEHS under this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance</strong>. It is anticipated the contract will have a base year and two one-year option periods. The contract type is expected to be firm fixed price.</p>
<p><strong>Other important considerations</strong>. The offeror will frequently update the chemistry and software of the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing instrument to maximize number of paired-end sequence reads per lane. Current versions of Illumina chemistries and imaging software as of January 2011 yield about 60 million reads per lane. It is anticipated that this number will increase substantially in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement /information sought</strong>. Respondents are requested to provide a Capability Statement of no more than five to eight (5-8) pages at 8.5 x 11 size which can be delivered electronically or by email to the Contracting Officer at email address of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lunney@niehs.nih.gov</span> or postal address to, Deitra Lunney, Office of Acquisitions, NIEHS, PO Box 12233, Mail Drop: K1-04, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.&nbsp;<br /><br /> March 28, 2011 is the post-marked due date for delivery of Capability Statement by interested respondents.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Capability Statement should include the following: (a) The respondent's interest and ability to perform contract objectives.

<p>3. The system should provide scenario control for the instructor.</p>
<p>4. The system should provide voice communication between consoles.</p>
<p>5. The system should provide voice recognition of ATC commands.</p>
<p>6. The system should stimulate operational ATC equipment.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;The system should be able to record, replay and freeze a training scenario, and replay it from a specific moment in time, allowing trainee interaction.</p>
<p>8. The system should be hardware independent.</p>
<p>9. The system should be executable on the Linux-based BlueCat operating system.</p>
<p>10. The system should provide a method for identifying software problems.</p>
<p>11. The system software should be maintainable via software upgrade.</p>
<p>12. The system should reload a selected software version from a storage device.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED</p>
<p>ATCP&amp;D is requesting that the following items (where applicable) be provided:</p>
<p>1. A company description and discussion of company capabilities with respect to fulfilling the objectives outlined in this RFI.</p>
<p>2. A description of previous experience in the development of similar software.</p>

<DESC>EXPRESSIONS OF INTERESTS SOUGHT

REQUIREMENT:

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Lake Havasu, AZ, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 5,500 contiguous rentable square feet of office space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 5,000 contiguous net usable square feet (USF). The lease term requirement is for three (3) years firm, with one (1), one (1) year option.  The space must be available for occupancy by October 1, 2011.  The delineated area is the City Limits of Lake Havasu, Arizona.  

Other applicable requirements include:
"	Parking: On-site parking for at least 28 reserved spaces, in which six (6) should be designated as handicapped, or minimum number of spaces required by local codes.
"	Other:
o	The space can be provided by modification of existing space.
o	All services, supplies, utilities, partitioning, and required alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical moves costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency down time.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0035<br />Name: Shredder, X18 cross-cut</p>
<p>NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0036<br />Name: Shredder, 108c cross-cut<br /><br />NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0037<br />Name: Shredder, 108 Strip Cut</p>
<p>NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0038<br />Name: Shredder, 125c Strip Cut</p>
<p>NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0039<br />Name: Shredder, 125 Cross Cut</p>
<p>NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0040<br />Name: Shredder, 225.2c Cross Cut</p>
<p>NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0041<br />Name: Shredder, 225.2s Strip Cut</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0035<br />Similar Items: 7490-01-567-4339, SWI SX16-08, FEL 990C</p>

<p>NSN: 7490-00-NIB-0041<br />Similar Items: 7490-01-567-4338, FEL 400SC,</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 14, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

Unlike ARGOS capable collars that provide a constant stream of data for evaluation, these recycled store-on-board collars must be retrieved to obtain the data.  Retrieval of data from store-on-board collars for use on this project would necessitate re-capturing collared animals every six (6) months (4 capture events) over the two (2) year project.  This increase in animal capture would add significant capture costs for aircraft, immobilization drugs, personnel time, and increase stress to captured animals as well as increase risk to personnel.  Change to another brand of collar would jeopardize the integrity of the study and would require purchase of new software and satellite services.

<DESC>Synopsis:Added: February 28, 2011 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 4 - Southeast Region, intends to award a firm-fixed-price, sole-source purchase order to Putnam Contracting Services, Inc. for the constuction of a jandicap fishing pier at Dale Hollow National Fish HatcheryI. This requirement will be fulfilled on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.  The Service has a planned project to construct a small handicap fishing pier along the outlet stream of the Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery.  The construction of this fishing pier will require piles to be driven adjacent to and behind the affected portion of streambank. However, the area of the planned fishing pier is within the bounds of an existing larger streambank stabilization project currently underway at this location and scheduled to finish in April, 2011.   It is in the Government's best interest to have the piles for the new pier driven and pier completed at the same time as the streambank gabion work and to have the same contractor perform both tasks.  In the event that the the piles are not placed at the same time as the streambank work, there will be a physical impossibility of siting the pier at this location due to the presence of fixed gabions, and there is not an alternate pier location available.  The efforts to remove the gabions would be an additional cost and could potentially result in further deterioration of the streambank.   THIS NOTICE IS NEITHER A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION NOR A SOLICITATION OF OFFERS. A determination not to compete this proposal contract has been made Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as implemented by 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), this requirement has been justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and FAR 6.304.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offeror; or, if non-price factors are evaluated as comparatively equal between two or more offerors, price may become a determinative factor.<BR><BR>Factors and their Relative Importance<BR><BR>Relative Order of Importance Terminology.  An evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria set forth below.  Evaluation criteria consist of factors.  In order to provide the offeror with an understanding of the significance assigned by the Government, the factors are assigned a relative order of importance.  The following terminology is used:<BR><BR>Significantly More Important.  The factor is substantially more important than another factor.  The factor is given far more consideration than another factor.<BR><BR>More Important.  The factor is greater in value than another factor, but not as much as a significantly more important factor.  The factor is given more consideration than another factor.<BR><BR>Approximately Equal.  The factor is nearly the same in value as another factor; any difference is very slight.<BR><BR>Relative Order of Importance of Factors.  The Technical factor is significantly more important than the Past Performance factor.  The Past Performance factor is more important than the Price factor.  The Technical factor and the Past Performance factor, when combined, are significantly more important than the Price factor.  There are no subfactors.   <BR><BR><BR>1. FACTOR I.  TECHNICAL:   <BR>The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the requirements to be performed in PWS Part 5 and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated.  Also, the Government will assess the proposed key personnel's specialized experience, qualifications, and education as it relates to the requirements to be performed in the PWS Part 5.  Finally, the Government will assess the proposed Quality Control Plan (QCP) to the extent it monitors, inspects, and correct deficiencies of the contract's requirements in PWS Part 5.  <BR>2. FACTOR II.  PAST PERFORMANCE: <BR>FACTOR 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE.   The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and currency of the offeror's past performance as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.  The source of information regarding past performance, the context of the data and general trends in performance may also be considered.  When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all solicitation requirements.  These requirements include all aspects of schedule and performance, including but not limited to, the offeror's record of: (1) quality of services provided; (2) timeliness of performance; and (3) commitment to customer satisfaction.  A significant achievement, problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of the work can become an important consideration in the source selection process.  A negative finding under any element may result in an overall high risk rating.  Therefore, offerors are reminded to include relevant past efforts, including demonstrated corrective actions, in their proposal.  Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources.  Since the Government may not necessarily contact all of the sources provided by the offeror, it is incumbent upon the offeror to explain the relevance of the data.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving good past performance rests with the Offerors.  If there is no relevant past performance, the offeror will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably and will be considered an unknown risk. <BR>3. FACTOR III.  PRICE: <BR>Price will be evaluated based upon an assessment of the total price proposed for the base period and each of the option periods.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).  <BR><BR>AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM<BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarter, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns with AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award of performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.<BR>HQ Army Material Command<BR>Office of Command Counsel<BR>9301 Chapek Road, Room 2-1SE3401<BR>Ft.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The RFQ number is R11PS34074. This announcement constitutes the only RFQ; quotations are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  This announcement will close at 3:00 p.m., local time, on March 7, 2011.
The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office has a requirement to purchase the following Wheatley-Gaso parts.  This is a Brand Name only acquisition.   
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:   This requirement is for replacement of mechanical components for the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP) Sludge Pumps, Wheatley-Gaso Inc. Horizontal End Suction Pumps Series 2652.  The Sludge Pumps are used to pump lime slurry from the YDP to the disposal site located 22 miles away. If we do not have the necessary parts to repair the sludge pumps, the sludge has to be trucked around the clock, which is prohibitively expensive and a great burden on Yuma Area Office personnel. We need to purchase these spare parts for the Wheatley-Gaso Sludge Pumps to keep them in operation.   
UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE PARTICULAR BRAND NAME PRODUCT: The design, materials of construction, and fabrication of these parts are proprietary to Wheatley-Gaso. They were engineered by Wheatley-Gaso to fit into their pumps, function correctly with the rest of the componentry and meet Wheatley-Gaso's proprietary design requirements; and are the only compatible source.
This procurement is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns. Large businesses are encouraged to submit quotes in the event that responsive small business quotes are not received. The associated North American Industrial Classification System code is 333911 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.

All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.

IRM 25.10.1 includes more detailed information on the Online 5081.  

3.  Contractor Acknowledgement. 

The contractor also acknowledges and agrees that he or she understands that all contract employees must comply with all laws, IRS system security rules, IRS security policies, standards, and procedures.  The contractor also acknowledges that a contract employee_s unsanctioned, negligent, or willful violation of the laws, IRS system security rules, IRS security policies, standards, and procedures may result in the revocation of access to IRS information technology systems, immediate removal from IRS premises and the contract, and for violations of Federal statute or state laws, the contract employee may be arrested by Federal law enforcement agents.

4.  Unauthorized Use of IRS Resources

Using _Push_ technology on the Internet, (e.g. subscribing to a service, not authorized by the IRS, that gathers information and sends it out automatically to subscribers), and continuous data streams such as streaming stock quotes are inappropriate uses.

(b)  Accessing personal e-mail accounts such as AOL or Hotmail through the IRS Internet firewall, hacker_s information or tools, chat rooms (involving instant messaging) or gambling sites;

(c)  Creating, downloading, viewing, storing, copying, or transmitting sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials such as adult pornography;

5.  Replacement Personnel.

6.  Monitoring Notification.

IRS management retains the right to monitor both the content and the level of access of contractor employees_ use of IRS IT systems.  Contractor employees do not have a right, nor should they have an expectation, of privacy while using any IRS information technology system at any time, including accessing the Internet or using e-mail.  Data maintained on government office equipment may be subject to discovery and Freedom of Information Act requests.  By using government information technology systems, consent to monitoring and recording is implied with or without cause, including (but not limited to) accessing the Internet or using e-mail or the telephone.  Any use of government information technology systems is made with the understanding that such use is generally not secure, is not private and is not anonymous.

7.  Subcontracts.

The Contractor shall incorporate this clause in all subcontracts, subcontract task or delivery orders or other subcontract performance instrument where the subcontractor employees will require access, use or operation of IRS information technology systems. 


3 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (APR 2008)  

As prescribed in 4.1105, use the following clause:

   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause_ 

_Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database_ means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. 

_Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number_ means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. 

_Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number_ means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. 

_Registered in the CCR database_ means that_ 

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record _Active_. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. 

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. 

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation _DUNS_ or _DUNS +4_ followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror_s name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. 

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number_ 

(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or 

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: 

(i) Company legal business. 

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. 

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. 

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical). 

(v) Company Telephone Number. 

(vi) Date the company was started. 

(vii) Number of employees at your location. 

(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. 

(ix) Line of business (industry). 

(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). 

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. 

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. 

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government_s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(g) 

(1) 

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, _doing business as_ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day_s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. 

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the _Suspension of Payment_ paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor_s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the _Suspension of payment_ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. 

                                                            (End of clause)

 Section I
  

I.1 52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER--CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)  


     (a) Method of payment. 
          (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. 
          (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either- 
               (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or 
               (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). 
     (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. 
     (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. 
     (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
     (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
          (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for- 
               (i) Making a correct payment; 
               (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and 
               (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
          (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and- 
               (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
               (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
     (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
      (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
     (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
     (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database. 
                                                              (End of clause)

<p>Background Information:<br />The NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine (NCRM) is seeking a company to provide courses to teach IRP researchers how to generate, maintain, and differentiate human iPS cells into a variety of lineages. NCRM is seeking a company with proven experience in stem cell technology and expertise in their differentiation to specific cell types such as neural, ocular or cardiac cells, and in providing effective training courses to beginning and advanced iPS researchers that contribute to successful hiPS cell generation and differentiation.</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />The objective of this task is to provide training in generating, maintaining, and differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) cell lines. Instructors will provide "state of the art" information on differentiating hiPS cells into embryoid bodies and various differentiated cell types such as neural, ocular or cardiac cells.</p>

The closer offerors are determined to be in technical merit, the greater the importance of cost or price in making an award. If offerors' proposals are evaluated as technically comparable, then cost/price will become an important consideration. A best value determination will be made.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria:<br />The Government intends to evaluate proposals and establish one contract without discussions. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.

 Offerors proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  Only those offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to the following:  Offerors must furnish documentation that adequately demonstrates the vendors ability to provide the two 48kw Battery Systems in accordance with the critical features.  Such documentation can be existing literature, previous or similar builds of various battery systems, engineering designs, inspection records, certification records, or any other documentation literature that demonstrates the vendors ability to produce the required items.
  Documentation must include a list of equipment used for manufacturing the Battery Systems.  Vendor must demonstrate ability to meet the required delivery date of 8 weeks after receipt of order.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.
 PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:  NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.
  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  OUTSTANDING:  Very little to not potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offerors past performance.  SATISFACTORY:  Little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance.  MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offerors past performance. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 9.104, in order to validate responsibility, the Offeror must furnish sufficient information that demonstrates that the Offeror has the necessary manufacturing equipment, inspection sources, tools and other materials and resources to fabricate the required gages and meet the required delivery schedule.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>The following clarifications are provided by the Government on 28 Feb 11.&nbsp; Also attached in word format for ease of reading.</p>
<p>CLARIFICATIONS for SOLICITATION FA4890-11-T-0002</p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you know if there is a required/preferred band for the wireless system to operate? C, L, S, or Ku band. Since this system is to be operated/delivered in El Paso, TX, I wanted to ensure that the wireless system that we utilize is suitable for your operating environment?</p>
<p>ANSWER: For the communications link, there is no preferred band; however the contractor should avoid bands/freqs the TARS system is currently using due to the potential for interference. For example, the air surveillance radar operates in the S-band. Other freqs currently in use at the Eagle Pass TX TARS site are shown in the attached Clarifications for TARS Camera Purchase document</p>
<p>QUESTION: Is there a requirement for a High Definition (HD) EO/IR system, and wanted to know if this was intentional, or is it assumed that the system would be HD since this is the standard in today's sensors.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The Government assumes that a system meeting today's commercial industry standard regarding Definition would be proposed.</p>

The NAICS code is 333120 and the small business size standard for this acquisition is 750 employees.

Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Reserved<br />(i) Reserved<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>QUESTION:<br />I have a question regarding spec 2 and 6. Spec 2 states that the min dimension of the aperture needs to be 1.5" but spec 6 states that you need a 3" microscope slide holder. Do you want the slide holder to be inserted in the stage or do you want it mounted on top of the stage?</p>
<p>ANSWER:<br />Either method (inserted or mounted on top of the stage) would be acceptable, as long as the result is compatible with observation in an inverted optical microscope, as in the background statement of use.</p>

<DESC>Reference No.: NHLBI-CSB-(AR)-2011-114-CRS
<p>Title: Human iPS (hiPS) Differentiation Training<br /><br />THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION NOTICE. <br />This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The reference solicitation number is: NHLBI-CSB-(AR)-2011-114-CRS</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures in accordance with FAR 13.3 Simplified Acquisition Methods, and FAR Part 13.5.</p>
<p>The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-048.</p>
<p>The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>The procurement is being conducted on a competitive basis. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is&nbsp;541690 and the Size Standard is $7.0 Million.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a fixed price type contract will be awarded. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30.</p>
<p>Period of performance: <br />The proposed period of performance for this requirement will consist of two days, in June 2011.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov/ prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement resulting from this solicitation. NOTE: lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for award.</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) requires the services of a company to provide courses to teach IRP researchers how to generate, maintain, and differentiate human iPS cells into a variety of lineages.</p>
<p>Background Information:<br />The NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine (NCRM) is seeking a company to provide courses to teach IRP researchers how to generate, maintain, and differentiate human iPS cells into a variety of lineages. NCRM is seeking a company with proven experience in stem cell technology and expertise in their differentiation to specific cell types such as neural, ocular or cardiac cells, and in providing effective training courses to beginning and advanced iPS researchers that contribute to successful hiPS cell generation and differentiation.</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />The objective of this task is to provide training in generating, maintaining, and differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) cell lines. Instructors will provide "state of the art" information on differentiating hiPS cells into embryoid bodies and various differentiated cell types such as neural, ocular or cardiac cells.</p>
<p>Scope:<br />The services to be provided under the task order shall include the following:<br />&bull; Provide training over a 2-day period in June 2011, to instruct 24 IRP scientists in how to generate, maintain, and differentiate hiPSCs. <br />&bull; At least 4 instructors will teach the course, providing a high instructor to student ratio.<br />&bull; The course will include both didactic information and "hands on" experience in making and differentiating hiPS cells.<br />&bull; The company will provide appropriate consumables, including reagents.</p>
<p>Reporting requirements:<br />The Scientific Director of Intramural Research in NIAMS will serve as the Project Officer for this contract, and will review and approve the work products generated.</p>
<p>Mandatory Qualifications:<br />Cost/price is a selection factor. All evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price, but not to the exclusion of consideration of cost or price. The closer offerors are determined to be in technical merit, the greater the importance of cost or price in making an award. If offerors' proposals are evaluated as technically comparable, then cost/price will become an important consideration. A best value determination will be made.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria:<br />The Government intends to evaluate proposals and establish one contract without discussions. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the public interest; accept an other than the lowest cost/priced proposal; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.</p>

The purpose of this amendment is to change the NAICS Code to 339111, and to post the following vendor questions and Government answers: 
(1) Question - Will a site visit be allowed to determine de-installation and installation needs of the current autoclave? Answer - Additional de-installation/installation information is as follows: the current autoclave must be taken apart and removed from the site, piece-by-piece; the hallways are more than wide enough to transport and remove the unit; there is a freight elevator, which can also be used. If this information is not enough to submit a quote, a site visit can be scheduled at the vendor?s convenience. Please contact Stefan Martiyan at (202) 564-1987 to do so. 
(2) Question - Will refurbished/remanufactured equipment be accepted? Answer - No. 
(3) Question - What are the specific warranty requirements? Answer - The standard manufacturer warranty will suffice. 
(4) Question - What is the current autoclave's footprint? Answer - The following information is provided: the dimensions of the current autoclave is 46" deep, 30" wide, and 76.5" high. 
The response date of this solicitation will not be extended as a result of this amendment.
ORIGINAL POSTING:The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) has a requirement for the purchase of one (1) autoclave.  The autoclave will replace an existing non-operational unit, which will be used for the Select Agent (Bacillus anthracis)-registered laboratory in order to decontaminate biohazardous materials.
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR QUOTE.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 339111, Autoclaves, laboratory-type (except dental), manufacturing.
The current autoclave is a Steris Amsco Century SG-120.  Its inner dimensions are 20? x 20? x 38?.  Its outer dimensions are 46? x  30? x 76.5?.  The unit has a single power door and is not recessed through a wall.  The replacement autoclave must fit into the footprint of the Steris Amsco Century SG-120 and have the same utility requirements.  This is essential because of the amount of space available, the location of the exhaust canopy, the floor drain, and the electric supply location cannot be changed.
In accordance with FAR Subpart 11.104, this item is being solicited on a brand name or equal purchase basis.  The brand name is Steris Corporation.  A general description of the requirement?s salient characteristics is as follows:
1. Unit must have a chamber size of approximately 20? x 20? x 38?.2. Unit must have outer dimensions similar to 46? x  30? x 76.5? so that it fits into the current unit?s footprint and so that all other salient characteristics are still met.3. Unit must have a single power door.4. Unit must not be recessed through any walls.5. Unit must have programmable cycles and provide both gravity and liquid cycles.6. Unit must be able to program in degrees Celsius.7. Unit must have an automatically-flushing integral steam generator.8. Unit generator must be equipped with a system to prevent scale build up over time in order to extend the life of the unit.9. Unit must have a water saving control system and automatic utilities startup/shutdown.10. Unit must have an optimal solution cooling system in place for liquid cycles, which will be used to sterilize prepared media in bottles and tubes.11. Unit must have a control system that provides an easy-to-read display, continuous cycle monitoring and control, and protects critical components from heat and moisture to avoid recurring and expensive circuit board replacement.11. Unit must have a self-prompting display.12. Unit must have printer with easy spool replacement.13. Unit available accessories must include a rack and two (2) shelves.
Additionally, the successful vendor must be able to:  de-install the current Steris Amsco Century SG-120 autoclave and remove it from the site; install the new autoclave within thirty (30) days after receipt of order (ARO); and provide, at least, a one (1) year preventative maintenance agreement.
*Note ? the successful vendor will have ownership of the current autoclave after its de-installation and removal from the site.  Given that the current unit has a value, offerors may find it wise to reduce their price quote accordingly.  The reason for the current autoclave?s inoperability is unknown.
Vendors must meet all characteristics as described above in order to be acceptable for award.  Vendors will be evaluated on a lowest-priced, technically acceptable basis.  Interested vendors are instructed to submit a price proposal for a brand name or equal item in response to this solicitation no later than the response date.
All responses and/or questions should be sent via email to Stefan Martiyan at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.  The deadline for submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation is 4 March 2011, 3:00 PM, ET.  Late responses will not be evaluated for award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>____________________________________________<BR><BR>PLEASE NOTE: The UIPE I1 Request for Proposals has been posted, and is available on the UIPE I1 website: https://www3.natick.army.mil/uipe1.html<BR><BR>Please see below for details.<BR><BR>____________________________________________<BR><BR><BR>The U. S. Army Contracting Command-APG(SCRT), Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Joint Program Office for Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Project Manager- Protection, has a requirement for a Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 1 (UIPE I1). The UIPE I1 will be a single supplemental system that will provide enhanced individual protective capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of psychological, physiological and heat stress associated with garment thermal burden, weight and bulk. It is not intended to replace currently fielded CB garments but will provide an alternative lightweight capability for selected missions. The UIPE I1 will provide protection from CB warfare agents to include retaining protection after exposure to Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) and other environmental contaminants. The garment will be suitable for wear while performing combat operations, whether on land or at sea, in any climate, with minimal impact on combat effectiveness. It will be designed to permit efficient communications and be compatible with current and developmental protective component systems. It will also be compatible with current and developmental clothing and equipment including load-bearing equipment, helmets (i.e., cranial protection), handwear, footwear, body cooling systems, and protective masks of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) and the US Navy (USN). Complete UIPE I1 performance requirements will be delineated in a detailed System Performance Specification (SPS).<BR><BR>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a UIPE I1 that will reduce thermal and physiological burden and reduce weight and bulk, over current Chemical-Biological (CB) protective garments. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the UIPE I1 by basing the design on a modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) product is central to the acquisition strategy.<BR><BR>The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type in which Delivery Orders may be issued for a one year base period and four, one year option periods. The Government envisions delivery orders which shall be Firm-Fixed-Price contracts. The guaranteed minimum value for each contract awarded will be $50,000.00, and the cumulative total of all Delivery Orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $129,000,000.00 over the life of the contract.<BR><BR>The Government envisions that multiple awards will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make a single award, if in the best interest of the Government. If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or a single successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation. <BR><BR>A small business goal of 30% is in effect and proposals shall address the small business plan. NAICS Code 315211 - Mens and Boys Cut and Sew Apparel Contractors applies with a small business size standard of 500 Employees.<BR><BR>Berry Amendment, DFARS 252.225-7012, applies to the resultant contract. Please note that items procured under this solicitation are considered chemical warfare protective clothing, and therefore the exemption described at Paragraph (c)(5) of the clause applies.<BR><BR>Contract award resulting from this solicitation is subject to availability of funds. Proposals shall be valid for at least 240 days. Please annotate the last day the proposal will be valid. Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with their proposal preparation.<BR><BR>The Request for Proposal will be posted on the Natick Contracting Center website- https://www3.natick.army.mil/uipe1.html, on Monday, 28 February 2011. Proposals will be due on Thursday, 31 March 2011.<BR><BR>All questions should be directed to john.conlin3@us.army.mil not later 4:00 PM EST, 14 calendar days after the date of release of this Solicitation. <BR>

<DESC>Q1.  Is there an incumbent contractor or is this a new requirement?  If there is an incumbent, can you please provide the contractor, contract number, award date and award amount?  I am aware of contract INN06PC10435, which was awarded to IBM; however I thought that contract expired in 2014.
A1.  There is not a current incumbent.  However, DOI did a pilot with SAP's BusinessObjects as a proof of concept to gain support for this effort to inquire about a new reporting tool.  However, BusinessObjects is not in production. Q2.  Can you provide Program Officer information (for reference purposes only).
A2.  It is unclear as to the intent of this question.  The RFI was issued by the contracting office and the program officer information will not be provided at this time.  Potential offerors are instructed to contact only the contracting point of contact identified for any information.  Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting government technical personnel in regard to this RFI or any request for quote/solicitation prior to potential award for this acquisition.  If such a contact occurs and is found to be prejudicial to potential competing offerors, the offeror making such a contact may be excluded from any further consideration.  Accordingly, all communications must be direct to the contracting point of contact.   Q3.  Is there an estimated contract value or maximum amount for this program?
A3.  The Government does not intend to disclose the Government cost estimate for this effort.  Also, the purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort. Q4.  Can you provide an estimated award time-frame or anticipated start date for this program?
A4.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort.  Once the determination has been made an estimated award time frame will be specified in the resultant request for quote/solicitation document.
Q5.  Based on the information provided in the draft, our company can provide pricing for the business intelligence licenses but requests a one-week extension to allow us to obtain the necessary internal approvals. Without an extension, our company can only provide our pricing model, rather than an actual price estimate. 
A5.  As stated above, the purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort.  Therefore, no pricing information is to be submitted with the capability statement submissions.
Q6.  DOI has only provided user counts for business intelligence but has also asked for software license and implementation pricing for activity based activity based costing, budget formulation, and consolidated financials.  There is not enough information to provide price estimates for software and implementation.  We could provide our pricing model for this additional functionality with the one week extension requested above.  If DOI's intent is for respondents to provide software license estimates for this additional functionality please provide the information under "Users in addition to BI Users" so that we can accommodate your request. If DOI does want pricing for these additional features, our company requests a three-week extension, which will allow time for you to respond with the counts and for us to price and obtain internal approvals.
A6.  As stated above, the purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort.  Therefore, no pricing information is to be submitted with the capability statement submissions. Q7.  The documents that have been posted do not provide detailed requirements for activity based activity based costing, budget formulation, and consolidated financials so we have insufficient information on which to base an implementation estimate.  Will DOI defer the request for implementation pricing until you are able to provide detailed requirements so that vendors have the information they need to provide DOI with realistic estimates? 
A7.  As stated above, the purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort.  Therefore, no pricing information is to be submitted with the capability statement submissions.
Q8.  DOI has included a table with 80 requirements and has also imposed a 10-page limit on vendor responses. Are you expecting vendors to indicate line-by-line if they meet the requirement or may we omit the table from our response and respond generally that we do / do not meet the requirements?
A8.  No, the Government is not expecting the capability statement to be a line-by-line response.  The intent of the capability statement is to provide sufficient information in order for the Government to make a determination regarding the potential vendor's ability to successfully perform.  The capability statement should provide a description of the experience and capability of the organization's ability to do the work and meet the requirements.  In addition, it should demonstrate an understanding of the overall requirements and any prior experience of similar scope.  
 Q9.  Does DOI already own and have they implemented the SAP Budget Formulation and Planning COTS software or does DOI want vendor's to provide an offer for a similar COTS software product?
A9.  DOI does not currently have the SAP Budget Formulation and Planning software.  Please keep in mind this RFI is not a request for quotes, offers, or proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is intended only to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort.  If a vendor feels they have a product that will meet the needs they should ensure their capability submission clearly demonstrates this ability.
Q10.  Besides CompuSearch PRISM, are there any other data sources that DOI bureaus need to report off that are NOT already located inside the SAP BW environment listed in figure 2 and 3?If our offer is unable to be deemed 100% compatible with and in uniformity with SAP's Netweaver Roadmap will this disqualify our offer?
A10. The basis for FBMS reporting is data sourced from R/3 and PRISM.  We currently do not support any other data sources, such as legacy systems.  The technical basis for FBMS reporting is SAP BW.  Any reporting tool has to be compatible with SAP BW as a data source.  
Q11.  Are there any current performance issues relating to existing SAP BW queries that DOI needs to solve?
A11.  The current reporting performance has been deemed acceptable.  Still, like any system, the Government is always looking for potential methods to improve performance.
Q12.  How many system administrators does DOI anticipate training for this new reporting infrastructure?  Is this what is meant by "Core Team Users"?
A12.  The Government's requirement will be for training.  However, the specific numbers as well as types of individuals will not be known or identified until the request for quote/solicitation is issued.  The requirement is to demonstrate the capability to provide training for the solution.  
Q13.  If we are able to provide similar references (ability to handle up to 100,000 users for SAP Financials) would DOI consider a performance base offer and/or proof of concept of Oracle Reporting/Analysis Tools vs. SAP Offering?
A13.  The Government is open to vendor suggestions and ideas that will satisfy the requirements. Please keep in mind this RFI is not a request for quotes, offers, or proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is intended only to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort.  
Q14.  Does DOI require licensing and maintenance costs for all 5 Option Years listed or would you prefer a total cost if pulled together for all the Option Years?
A14.  Funding has been estimated on a per year basis so DOI knows the estimated budget across all 5 years.   Also, as stated above, the purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort.  Therefore, no pricing information is to be submitted with the capability statement submissions.
Q15.  Does our response need to include responses to each requirement of the 80 software requirements?  And can this be a separate attachment that is not included as part of the 10 pages?
A15.  No, the Government is not expecting the capability statement to be a line-by-line response nor can any information be included as an attachment outside the page limitation.  The intent of the capability statement is to provide sufficient information in order for the Government to make a determination regarding the potential vendor's ability to successfully perform.  The capability statement should provide a description of the experience and capability of the organization's ability to do the work and meet the requirements.  In addition, it should demonstrate an understanding of the overall requirements and any prior experience of similar scope.  
Q16.  Requirements #1 and #2 appear to be duplicates?  Is this the case or is one of the requirements missing?
A16.  Requirements #1 and #2 are duplicates.  There are no requirements missing.
Q17.  The document requests that the solution be able to produce standard federal financial and budget related reports (e.g.SF-133).  Is this to replace SAP functionality, and if so, is it being delivered through SAP ERP or SAP BW currently?  
A17. The vendor's solution should be able to produce standard reports (for example from SAP ERP and SAP BW.
Q18.  Other than the Consolidated Financials and Budget Formulation modules, is everything in Figure 1 on Page 1 in existence and in production today?
A18.  Yes.
Q19.  Will there be any requirement to go directly against SAP ECC or does all reporting functionality go to BW and the other data sources mentioned in Requirement # 1?
A19.  FBMS does have reports that go directly against SAP ECC.  However, the Government will entertain other solutions that offer cross functionality.
Q20.  Requirement # 11 states that the solution must handle 100,000 users.  Can you give us a percentage breakdown by general category as to how these users will use the system?  (E.g. heavy report authoring, report consumption, analysis, dashboard consumption, ad hoc queries etc.).  What is the expected usage as a percentage of a user's time on average?   Also, page 3 of the SOW shows # of users scaling to 2000+, how do 100,000 users come into play?
A20.  Based on review and this comment, the Government will delete Requirement 11 from the requirements.  Therefore, vendors are not required to address this in the capability submissions.
Q21.  For the two additional requirements of Consolidated Financial Statements and Budget Formulation & Planning, will there be any more forthcoming detailed requirements similar to the reporting requirements you provided in the RFI?  What exactly are you expecting from the vendors with respect to detail in answering these requirements as they are worded presently?
A21.  The FBMS PMO plans to install COTS products.  Please describe Consolidated Financial Statements and Budget Formulation & Planning products that are tightly integrated with your reporting solutions.
Q22.  The SOW states: the new reporting tools must be capable of integrating with:
ECC 6.0 EHP6+SPrism and Prism Grants PRISM v7.xBW (Netweaver platform TBD)SAP Enterprise Portal (Netweaver platform TBD)SAP Process Integration (Netweaver platform TBD)SAP Solution Manager (Netweaver 7.1)Open Text (Full Opentext Records Management v TBDSolution Manager v TBD
Specifically, what kind of integration are you looking for, what would you like to accomplish?
A22.  The requirements document will be reworded to read, "the new reporting tools must be compatible with the following:" 
Q23.  The SOW states that you want to: Retain the use of FBMS Authorization objects to control data-level security (e.g. Business Area, Cost Center, etc).  Are you referring to authorization variables or infocube level security?
A23.  The FBMS is referring to Info Object Variables.
Q24.  A comment on page 1 of the Requirements Document references the focus of the Reporting Improvements effort as follows:  
The focus of this effort is to improve the current FBMS reporting (BEx Web Analyzer, reporting against the BW infrastructure).  Later on page two, the Requirements Document references a "new reporting tool".  
Can the government please provide clarification with regard to these two different messages - is the government requesting a new reporting product or does DOI intend to utilize the current reporting infrastructure?
A24.  DOI intends to utilize the current reporting data storage of SAP BW.  It also intends to have a transition period where both the current tool, BEx Web Analyzer and the new reporting tool, will both be available to the end users.
Q25.  Can more detail be provided related to the use of BusinessObjects' in the current FBMS landscape?  Figure 1 on page 1 of the Requirements Documents shows BusinessObjects as a part of the current FBMS landscape. Yet, it is not mentioned later on this page when the SAP integrated suite and its components are detailed as followed:  
(SAP ECC, SAP Enterprise Portal, SAP BW, SAP PI, and SAP GRC) combined with several additional applications (Compusearch PRISM, and Oracle RDBMS)
A25.  DOI did a pilot with Business Objects as a proof of concept to gain support for this effort to inquire about a new reporting tool.  Business Objects is not in production.
Q26.   Can the government clarify which BusinessObjects product Figure 1 is intended to refer to - i.e. does it refer solely to the BusinessObject Enterprise XI product or are there other BusinessObjects products included?  For each of those products, what modules are available and/or have been licensed?
A26.  DOI did a pilot with Business Objects as a proof of concept to gain support for this effort to inquire about a new reporting tool.  Business Objects is not in production.
Q27.  Page 1 of the RFI Document and pages 1 and 4 of the Requirements Document references "Dashboards." Does the government intend for this dashboard term to reference a specific technical capability such as BusinessObjects Xcelsius product or is the reference related to a general, more dynamic and visually engaging reporting capability?
A27.  The term is being used to relate to a general, more dynamic and visually engaging reporting capability and no specific tool.
Q28.  Page 7 of the Requirements Document details a series of Treasury and Other Submission Upload Files. Can the government clarify the upload format for these files? Is it correct to assume that Netweaver and/or PI shall be utilized to facilitate the delivery of the extract files?
A28.  The format for these files is controlled by the receiving organization.  The method of delivering these files varies by the receiving organization.  PI is the preferred method for FBMS, but this is not always within the control of DOI.
Q29.  Page 6 of the Requirements Document details that the new reporting system to provide audit trail capabilities. Can the government further define the specific functions entailed within those audit capabilities?
A29.  The requirements document will be revised prior to request for quotes/solicitation that will identify the Government's requirements regarding audit trail functionality.  However, for this phase of the process the capability statements should address if the solution has the capability for audit trails.  Also, the Government is interested in best practice capabilities within industry for this area.
Q30.  Page 6 of the Requirements Document contains a requirement that the new reporting capability allows mobile employees to view business information even when offline. What specific offline capabilities are required and what types of mobile devices need to be supported?
A30.  As an example, the simplest requirement is for individuals to download the report to their laptop and manipulate the report while not connected to FBMS.
Q31.  Page 7 of the Requirements document references Budget Formulation & Planning requirements as follows:
The tool or add on module shall provide the capability to automate the formulation and planning of the agency and bureau budgets.  This includes the integration and automation of all process, sub-processes and document preparation related to Federal budget formulation, funds distribution, and planning.  
Can the government provide clarification as to whether the reporting improvement effort is intended to actually facilitate the build of a system that can be used for the generation of future budgets or solely to provide reporting against such a budget formulation capability?
A31.  The current requirement is for reporting against budget execution and formulation functionality.  However, the Government is also interested in functionality within the product that would allow for the generation of future budgets.  This will provide flexibility for the Government in budget formulation. Q32.  What is DOI's definition and requirements of budget formulation?  Does it include:Calculation of future administrative budgets including staff projections and overhead/benefit allocation?  Incorporation of program budgets?  Trend analysis of past spending and cost data to better forecast future cost rates?  Workflow to allow hierarchy when formulating budgets (e.g. the field budgets at a division level, then that budget is compiled across regions or an agency)?
A32.  FBMS has a potential future requirement to support federal budget formulation.  At this time, those detailed requirements have not been finalized.  The types of capabilities listed are what is expected to be detailed if FBMS is expanded to support federal budget formulation.
Q33.  Who is the incumbent provider of DOI's FBMS reporting capabilities?  Will the incumbent contractor be allowed to bid on the procurement of the services described in the RFI?
A33.  There is not a current incumbent.  However, DOI did a pilot with SAP's BusinessObjects as a proof of concept to gain support for this effort to inquire about a new reporting tool.  However, BusinessObjects is not in production.  This, however, will not preclude any potential offeror from participating in this acquisition.
Q34.  The RFI Structure detailed in the RFI Document requests no more than 10 pages of a firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described in the RFI and Requirements Documents. Can the government provide clarification with regard to the desired RFI response structure so that we may do our best to provide the information required and help DOI to make as informed a decision as possible as to how to proceed?
A34.  The intent of the capability statement is to provide sufficient information in order for the Government to make a determination regarding the potential vendor's ability to successfully perform.  The capability statement should provide a description of the experience and capability of the organization's ability to do the work and meet the requirements.  In addition, it should demonstrate an understanding of the overall requirements and any prior experience of similar scope.  
Q35.  With regard to the desired structure of the response to the RFI, is it the government's intention to receive recommendations as to proposed solutions based upon the Requirements Document within these 10 pages?
A35.  It is the Governments intention to receive a COTS solution for the specified requirements.  Please keep in mind this RFI is not a request for quotes, offers, or proposals.  The intent of the capability statement is to provide sufficient information in order for the Government to make a determination regarding the potential vendor's ability to successfully perform.  The capability statement should provide a description of the experience and capability of the organization's ability to do the work and meet the requirements.  In addition, it should demonstrate an understanding of the overall requirements and any prior experience of similar scope.  If a vendor feels they have a product that will meet the needs they should ensure their capability submission clearly demonstrates this ability.
Q36.  Page 1 of the RFI explains that the purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. Does DOI intend to utilize responses to this RFI to in any way down-select bidders should this RFI later result in a related solicitation?
A36.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein in order to make a determination regarding the acquisition strategy for this effort (i.e. Open Market or GSA Federal Supply Schedule).  It is in no way intended to be utilized as a down-select based on responses received. 
Q37.  In the interests of providing DOI with as informed responses as possible, and due to the proximity of the RFI due date and the submission date for questions, can an extension be provided for the RFI deadline to provide at a minimum 1 business week to respond from the date that questions are answered?
A37.  An extension is being granted.  Capability statements are now due no later than Friday, March 4, 2011, 3 pm Eastern Time.

One meaning is that the system has been approved for flight by the applicable Airworthiness Authority. For example, the GPS system that is being installed on Navy C-130T aircraft will be certified airworthy by NAVAIR. FAA/ICAO certification for flight in international airspace would also be considered as another type of certification (CNS/ATM certified). An autopilot may be certified for CAT-I approaches. We'd like to know to what extent your proposed system is certified in all respect.</p>

<DESC>MOD TO TITLE AND MOD TO DESCRIPTION&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) intends to negotiate a contract modification to the P-8A System Development and Demonstration contract with The Boeing Company (Boeing), P.O. Box 3707, 7755 East Marginal Way, Seattle, WA 98124-2499, on an other than full and open competition basis for Airworthiness Testing (AWT) of the Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS). The AWT will include engineering and flight testing of the AAS pod on the P-8A for safety-of-flight testing and certification. This modification also includes an option for the development of the procedures to remove, replace, and repair key components on the P-8A T-1 aircraft in order to restore its service life. This option, which has a 30-month period of performance, is anticipated to be exercised no later than December 2011 and includes the removal, procurement/refurbishment, and installation of the weapons bomb bay support structure, sections of the fuselage tail, horizontal stabilizers, and replacement of load pins. The effort shall be procured pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Boeing is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the Boeing P-8A airframe, as well as the sole integrator of the avionics systems, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements on a timely basis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail, U.S. mail or facsimile to the attention of Duane Drury using the contact information provided in this synopsis. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Boeing directly.

<DESC>BARDA - Strategic Science and Technology Division<br />Broad Agency Announcement Synopsis Notice
<p>Science and Technology Platforms Applied to Medical Countermeasure (MCM) Development</p>
<p>The Office of Acquisition Management Contracts &amp; Grants (AMCG) with the office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies. BARDA/AMCG's mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN), as well as the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases that fall outside the auspices of Project BioShield.</p>
<p>Preparedness mission and priorities are articulated in the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Implementation Plan for CBRN Threats and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza. The implementation plans are located on the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) website http://www.phe.gov/preparedness/pages/default.aspx and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza on the website http://www.pandemicflu.gov.</p>
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act (PAHPA) directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist countermeasure and product advanced research and development, (ii) research on and development of research tools and other devices and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives. Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), BARDA seeks to advance the technological and scientific advancements of medical countermeasures for biodefense and emerging infectious disease threats, including pandemic influenza. The PAHPA is located on the ASPR website http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/pahpa/pages/default.aspx.</p>
<p>This BAA is a continuation of a previous BAA (BARDA-BAA-09-100-SOL-0010) and is similarly designed to promote science and technology advancements of platforms applied to MCM development for the Strategic Science and Technology Division (SST) of BARDA/AMCG and will be open to all responsible Offerors. The Government's intent is to solicit potential advancements in science and technology in the following BARDA SST Areas of Interest:</p>
<p>1. Technologies to accelerate evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics.</p>
<p>2. Formulation chemistry, protein stabilization, and vaccine delivery technologies.</p>
<p>3. Innovative methods in bioprocess development and manufacturing.</p>
<p>4. Methods and technologies to advance development of tests for rapid diagnosis of human injury and infection.</p>
<p>The BARDA SST Areas of Interest are designed to target platform technologies focused on (1) product improvements to enhance the safety, efficacy, and ease of use of MCM, (2) reducing time and cost of MCM development, evaluation, and manufacturing, and (3) development of innovative diagnostic platforms for the rapid diagnosis of priority pathogens. The specific application of the technologies will focus on biodefense, pandemic influenza, and other emerging infectious diseases (EID). BARDA is open to evaluation of technologies at multiple stages of product development. BARDA anticipates that demonstrating utility of these novel platform technologies will generate validated data suitable for comparability analysis with candidate products and have direct application to commercial-scale manufacturing or testing processes. The development activities are to be fully integrated with regulatory activities associated with product development efforts.</p>
<p>BARDA anticipates awarding multiple contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and/or other transactions for research and development efforts from this BAA that have sufficient potential for success, are of interest to the Government, and support one or more of the listed BARDA SST Areas of Interest.</p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD awarded a $5,500,000 delivery order to Raytheon Company, Space and Airborne Systems for the procurement of two AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars to be retrofitted into F/A-18E/F aircraft Lots 26-29. The AN/APG-79 AESA radar, which will replace the APG-73 radar, will provide increased air-to-air detection and track range, increased air-to-ground targeting capabilities, longer launch range for standoff weapons, enhanced capability against advanced threats, and optimized utilization of the aircraft's weapon systems contributing to the F/A-18E/F's survivability.

<DESC>The project will provide replacement to the existing Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system currently in use at the 30,430 square feet (SF) Naval Operation Service Center (NOSC) at Avoca, PA.  The new HVAC system will use energy efficient technology and provide centralized heating, ventilation and air-conditioning with a digital control system.  The Direct Digital Controls (DDC) system will control all terminal and central equipment.  The DDC system will change ventilation rates as well as temperature setpionts for occupied and unoccupied modes.  This will allow for a significant decrease in ventilation air when certain areas of the facility are not in use.  The building will meet current indoor air quality standards set forth by DOD/ASHRAE for healthy working environment.

<AWDNBR>FA4814-11-D-0003
<DESC><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN <br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY <br />Department of the Air Force, 6th Contracting Squadron/LGCB, 2606 Brown Pelican Avenue, MacDill AFB, FL 33621-5000.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br />The Air Force proposes to award a sole source commercial purchase order to L-3 Communications Corporation, NARDA Microwave-East, 435 Moreland Road, Hauppauge, New York, 11788-3926 for the maintenance and repair of satellite terminals. The estimated value is $XXXXXXXXXXX. The period of performance is 1 March 2011 - 29 February 2012, with two 1 year option periods.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS<br />The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) requires a contract for the maintenance, repair and testing of various satellite terminals contained within the AN/USC-60 Fly-Away Tri-Band Satellite Terminal (FTSAT), the AN/TSC-161 Quad Band Dual Hub Terminal (QDHT), OE-593/F Lightweight Medium Aperture Antenna (LMAA), and the Integrated Multiple Antenna Terminal Electronics (IMATE) systems. These satellite terminals serve as the primary communications means supporting tactical operations around the world. This support includes contingency and crisis communications for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commands, Services, Defense agencies, non-Defense agencies, and foreign governments.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br />The AN/USC-60 Fly-Away Tri-Band Satellite Terminal (FTSAT), AN/TSC-161 Quad Band Dual Hub Terminal (QDHT), OE-593/F Lightweight Medium Aperture Antenna (LMAA), and the Integrated Multiple Antenna Terminal Electronics (IMATE) are manufactured and maintained by L-3 Communications Corporation, NARDA Microwave-East. All of the components are critical to the operation of the satellite terminals and require very intensive testing to ensure operational parameters are maintained. L3 Communications Corporation, NARDA Microwave-East is the sole designer and integrator of the USC-60, TSC-161, OE-593/F and IMATE and they are the only known source available to accomplish the integrated testing and repair of components in the system. L3 does not have suppliers nor do they distribute this equipment. The only other alternative (which is not practical or desirable since the current system still has useful life) is to completely replace the system by procuring a new one. Bringing a new system on line would be costly and would require updating all training and technical documentation and obtaining certification for the new system. Until the current system reaches the end of its useful life, repairing and maintaining it is the preferred and prudent course of action. Again, L3 is the only source we've been able to identify who can perform the required maintenance and repair services.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE <br />At the beginning of FY11, 6 CONS procured a one-time repair for different satellite terminals, FA4814-11-P-0037 to L-3 Communications Corporation, NARDA Microwave-East. This was posted on FedBizOps as unrestricted since previous acquisitions revealed only one company (large) could fulfill this requirement. In the past JCSE had a non-competitive contract in place with the US Navy awarded to SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic Charleston (N65236-10-P-4304). When the current requirement surfaced and was defined as recurring, 6 CONS decided to write an IDIQ contract instead of going back through SPAWAR. We posted a request for information (RFI) to Fed Biz Ops (FBO) for 30-days to ensure ample time for all sources to respond. When the RFI closed on 6 December 2010, no responses were received. Nonetheless, 6th CONS will synopsize the proposed acquisition and consider any qualified sources who may respond.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE <br />The Contracting Officer shall determine the price offered to be fair and reasonable through commercially available cost or pricing information, the comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items (FAR 15.403-3(c) and FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)) and negotiated rates for material, labor and related mark-ups. Rates published by L-3 and its major competitors, Hughes, Raytheon, and Lockheed-Martin, will be used as a comparison.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH<br />WAS NOT CONDUCTED<br />The contracting office posted a sources sought on FedBizOps on 2 Nov 10 to see if there were any other companies that have the capability to repair, maintain and test failed components in the designed system. When the sources sought closed on 6 Dec 10, no responses were received.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br />None.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION<br />L-3 Communications</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES <br />JCSE will continue seeking sources through market research, industry events, vendor demonstrations, and testing of products to foster full and open competition for any acquisition of this requirement or similar requirements in the future. <br /><br />XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION<br />The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>
