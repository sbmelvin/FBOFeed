<DESC>The objective is to conduct applied R&amp;D to develop and demonstrate leap-ahead agile RF front-end systems with multi-function transmit / receive technology by employing reconfigurable RF &amp; mixed-signal components which enable integrated Radar, Communications, &amp; EW suites within a single platform. Salient features of the REMAR module are (1) configurable system architecture, (2) adaptable frequency plan, (3) tunable instantaneous bandwidth, (4) scalable DC &amp; RF power, and (5) agile waveform. Critical performance goals for the system include ultra wide bandwidth, high dynamic range, low phase noise, environmental compensation, on-chip calibration to enable autonomous adaptation, &amp; precise bias control. Ultimately, the REMAR technology will result in a highly flexible system with dramatic cost, size, weight, and power (CSWAP) reduction for future advanced sensor technology critical to the warfighter.
<p>Contractor shall systematically assess and develop leap-ahead reconfigurable RF/mixed-signal components with embedded digital control to enable adaptable On-The-Fly (OTF) electronics capable of performing multiple sensor functions simultaneously. System capability demonstrations and performance impact analysis are required by contractor at the end of the baseline period of performance with updated demonstration/analysis at the end of the option period. Contractor shall seek to identify and demonstrate advanced technologies and novel techniques to increase system flexibility without compromising performance. Advanced techniques such as (1) OTF adaptable system configuration (polarization, frequency, bandwidth, power, &amp; waveform); (2) cognitive (very low latency reactionary and anticipatory) functionality; (3) coordinated &amp; distributed network enabled capability; (4) broadband &amp; multi spectral performance; &amp; (5) advanced protection/survivability techniques are desirable attributes for REMAR.</p>

This is a full and open requirement.  All proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(i), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.   
Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.   
The Contractor is required to be "Export Controlled" certified to receive and view the drawings for this solicitation.

Foreign owned firms are advised to contact Chris Lally at (405) 734-8112 or email christopher.lally.1@us.af.mil before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions to receiving an award.   
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets Qualification Requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review a pending Source Approval Request (SAR).  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards.   
Contractor First Article (FA) testing is required. An amendment will be issued to add FA requirements and revise the evaluation factors for award (Section M), if there are offeror(s) interested in becoming approved source(s). Note that the FA requirement is waived for the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Pratt and Whitney.  
First Article testing is required to ensure the reliability and integrity of the item and operational safety of the weapon system that uses it.  First Article testing is waived if the offeror is the prime contractor, Pratt and Whitney.  All other offerors can apply for a waiver of First Article approval under the following condition(s): Offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar article to the prime contractor for delivery to the Government; offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Government, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Government; provided not more than 36 months have elapsed since completion of the contract.  Note: Determination of acceptability of 'or similar' items may only be made by the engineering office initiating this First Article requirement.   
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

Removal of the actual gate is not included in this procurement. This work requires designing, furnishing, installing, and testing an Electro-Osmotic Pulse (EOP) calcite mitigation system. There is a positive security requirement at the site.</p>

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the continuation of Contract NAS5-26555 with the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) for continued operation of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) which provides full science management of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and supports the HST science and flight operations facility. The requirement is for the contractor to continue to provide the products and services required to execute the science program, maintain and calibrate the onboard instruments, maintain the ground systems, archive and distribute the science data, perform follow-on mission studies, manage the HST grants program, and conduct astronomical research during the remaining years of HST science mission as well as operate and maintain the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). The period of performance for this effort is May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2021. <P> NASA/GSFC intends to extend Contract NAS5-26555 with AURA under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. AURA is the only known source that possesses the required experience and expertise in all areas, including, but not limited to astronomy, HST operations, optics, detectors, systems engineering, public affairs, grants administration, and foreign agreements to successfully meet the specific challenging mission requirements. HST is a highly complex and internationally acclaimed spacecraft that provides astronomical observing capabilities that are unique in the world. AURA is the only contractor that possesses a complete knowledge of HSTs mission requirements in the critical area of planning and schedulingknowledge that is indispensable for maximizing the science return from the observatory. AURAs expertise in science operations is required to ensure the safety of the instruments and to process and calibrate the data so that it can be easily and effectively distributed to the astronomical community. AURA has expertly and continuously refined the science operations techniques of the mission during the past 25 years to incorporate changes and has worked with the astronomical community to develop, peer-review, communicate, and coordinate these changes with the telescopes users. AURA has made extensive, complex modifications to the planning, scheduling, and command-load-generation systems to support mission-critical life-extension activities. AURA is the only known source that possesses the end-to-end life cycle knowledge and skill set to safely and effectively operate the HST instrument suite. <P> AURA is also the only identified source with deep, growing synergies between the HST and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) missions that demonstrably reduce risk, increase productivity, and minimize costs for both programs. <P> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing via email to Michele.R.Connerton@nasa.gov no later than 2:00 p.m. local time on April 13, 2015.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The Epidemiology Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, a modification to its current contract no. HHSN275201000020C entitled "Diabetes Risk Across Women's Life Span." <br /><br />The NICHD anticipates that their services are congruent with the current services provided by Harvard University and the monitoring reports from these tasks will be incorporated into the already existing infrastructure for regulatory reporting for the &lsquo;"Diabetes Risk Across Women's Life Span" Study.<br /><br />Background<br />This action would result in a modification to contract Number HHSN275201000020C to extend the period of performance for one year in order to allow the current contractor to complete the statement of work. The overarching goal of the study is to assess genetic and environmental factors and their interactions underlying the progression of glucose intolerance during pregnancy to type 2 diabetes and comorbidities. The existing &lsquo;"Diabetes Risk Across Women's Life Span" Study infrastructure provides the efficient requisite of unique data and resources to address the above mentioned research aims. <br /><br />The services will include the following: re-contact, screen, recruit, consent, collect, process, store, and ship all requested questionnaire data and biospecimens as specified in the study manual of procedures from eligible women with a documented history of gestational diabetes in at least one of their pregnancies that was at least 10 years prior to enrollment in the present study, to fulfill the ultimate goal of enrollment of approximately 4000 eligible women for the entire study; Prospectively follow and retain women in compliance with the study protocol. Successful recruitment denotes obtaining consent, completion of the enrollment questionnaires and the collection of blood, urine and saliva samples; Maintain an eligibility and recruitment database enumerating all women approached for recruitment into the study, women excluded and reasons for exclusion. The database will include items specified by the study protocol and updated according to a study protocol and in collaboration with the NICHD Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and will be instrumental for assessing possible selection/information biases; Participate in weekly or biweekly telephone conferences and annual steering committee meeting at NICHD with the COR and other investigators; Maintain IRB approval throughout the conduct of the study per the requirements of the Contractor's IRB(s) and prepare the final IRB report.<br /><br />The NICHD anticipates that the services described above can only be conducted as part of the existing infrastructure of the Diabetes Risk across Women's Life Span study. Awarding a new contract to another contractor would require them to duplicate the infrastructure for regulatory reporting that already exists. This would result in unacceptable delays, substantial duplication of effort, and increased costs to the government.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals. However, if any responsible source believes it can perform the above requirement, they may submit three (3) copies of their capability statement for consideration by the NICHD to Jacquelin Jones, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (or overnight courier: 6100 Executive Boulevard, Rockville, Maryland, 20852). Phone number (301) 435-6965, and fax number (301) 402-3676. Secondary point of contact is Adelola Kellum, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (or overnight courier: 6100 Executive Boulevard, Rockville, Maryland, 20852). Phone number (301) 435-6955, and fax number (301) 402-3676. All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD to determine if the party can perform this requirement. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(Reference 52.211-6) <BR> <BR>(Reference 52.212-4) <BR> <BR>(Reference 1352.233-71) <BR> <BR>I have read and agreed to the "52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS- COMMERCIAL ITEMS" Clause in the attached 'Additional Clauses' document. <BR> <BR>This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<SUBJECT>R--Collaboration at Sea (CAS) and Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System  Maritime (CENTRIXS M) Coalition and Allied Communications Program Support
<SOLNBR>N0018915R0026
<CONTACT>Thomas Armstrong (757) 443-3115
<DESC>The Contracting Department, NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC), Norfolk, VA, intends to negotiate a single award, firm fixed price (FFP) indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  

Navy Information Dominance Forces (NAVIDFOR) is a readiness Type Commander (TYCOM) with the global responsibility of identifying, and submitting requirements for all Navy Information Dominance capabilities. 

This solicitation is for a non-personal services contract to provide contractor personnel for the management, support, and operation of the Collaboration at Sea (CAS) and Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System  Maritime (CENTRIXS-M) Coalition and Allied communications programs.
 CAS is a web based system used to convey mission essential information to a large group of users with low band-width consumption. CENTRIXS-M forms the network backbone and global infrastructure for coalition and multinational Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) interoperability. It provides secure tactical and operational information sharing between U.S. and coalition maritime partners. Similar services are currently being provided under N65236-11-D-3852, delivery order 0001, awarded to Computer Sciences Corporation.

CAS is the Navys global collaborative application, using the SIPRNET and Secret Releasable (SREL) CENTRIXS networks as its communications path, providing chat rooms, Email, and standardized group web sites.
  The fundamental concept behind CAS is that users access a customizable group website that resides on servers aboard every ship in the group.  Each ships web server is synchronized with the other ships in the group through a shore based master web server using a database replication scheme (IBM Lotus Domino based).  Because shipboard users access a local web server, limited bandwidth is not used to support off ship web browsing to a CAS Web Site.  CAS has expanded beyond the original concept of a Strike Group tool.  CAS now encompasses Fleet Commands (ashore and afloat), as well as program of record and non-program of record SREL enclaves.  These CAS sites are critical to the communication abilities on the SREL networks which link the U.S.
 Navy with coalition partners.
Tasks consist of program and project management; network engineering support; information security; Information Assurance; Tier I, II, and III Service Desk Support; web applications programming and development; systems engineering; systems integration; software testing; configuration management; software deployment and version control; system technical documentation; user training; and operations support.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size Standard of $27.5M.  After analyzing submittals received in response to a Sources Sought notice posted on 12 February 2015, the prospective Request for Proposal (RFP) will be processed utilizing Full and Open Competition and will require a Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

The resulting contract will be for a twelve (12) month base period and four (4) twelve month option periods.
  FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be included in the solicitation and contract.  All options will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 17.206(a).  A complete RFP package will be available by downloading the documents at the NECO Website as follows: http://www.neco.navy.mil or FEDBIZOPPS at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 14 April 2015.  Potential contractors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above site; this office will NOT issue hard copy solicitations. By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.
 Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.  Please direct all questions regarding this requirement via e-mail to the POC identified in this synopsis.

Initial price proposals must be submitted along with initial technical proposal to the Contracting Officer in accordance with the requirements of RFP.  Offerors are advised that the Government may award a contract based on initial proposals received without discussions or any contact concerning the proposal received; therefore, each proposal should contain the offeror's best terms.   <br>  <br> The Solicitation Number W912BU-15-R-0021 will be issued on or about 13 April 2015 with a closing date of on or about 12 May 2015 at 1400 hours.

<DESC>Program Manager Light Armored Vehicles (PM LAV), located at the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC), in Warren, Michigan, seeks to determine industry capability to provide logistics support in the refurbishment or repair of items that address the Mobility & Obsolescence (MOB) Program's Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) automotive system obsolescence and reduced performance due to an increased Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW).  This acquisition program will restore automotive performance, mobility at increased GVW, maintainability and reliability/availability due to the increased GVW beyond the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). Part of the solution set in resolving the MOB issues is to replace FOLAV driveline and steering components  with Stryker Gen 3.5 components, of which the Government has a cache of these items , but will require refurbishment or repair of these components to Condition Code A.

<DESC>Overview: The Government is seeking information to determine industry's capability to produce Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) Family of Systems spare and repair parts and provide engineering support services. This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation, or Request for Proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this request. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposal or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. Parties responding to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <br>  <br> Description:  The AN/TPQ-49 and AN/TPQ-50 are lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar locating radars that use computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  It provides simultaneous hostile weapon locations, discrimination and friendly fire observation of mortars, cannons and rockets.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 has improved range and accuracy for mortars.  It is disassembled into man-portable cases which fit into a single up-armored M1152 or equivalent high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV).  The LCMR is assembled and emplaced on or off the vehicle by a two person team.  Interoperability and other performance requirements are delineated in the System Performance Specification.  <br>  <br> Acquisition Strategy: In August 2012, the United States Army Contracting Command awarded a three-year Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the procurement of engineering support services for the LCMR Family of Systems as well as spare and repair parts, provisioning and replenishment spares for fielded systems. The contract supports AN/TPQ-50 systems produced or fielded worldwide in the following areas: sustainment, technical and repair support, shipping, training, documentation (to include provisioning technical documentation to support the logistics requirements) and manual updates, field and sustainment level support required to maintain the AN/TPQ-49 (for FMS customers only) and the Army's Program of Record, the AN/TPQ-50 LCMR system. The PWS defines the requirements for mission critical Contractor Sustainment Support (CSS) for the AN/TPQ-49 (for existing FMS customers with open cases only) and the Army's Program of Record, the AN/TPQ-50 LCMR system. The CSS includes Contractor Field Service Representative (CFSR) services for Foreign Military Sales customers possessing the AN/TPQ-49 version of the LCMR. <br>  <br> The Government does not possess a build-to-print technical data package (TDP) for the LCMR AN/TPQ-50.  <br>  <br> The Government hereby seeks updated information regarding industry's capability to provide spare parts, repair parts, provisioning and replenishment deliverables as well as the services for the AN/TPQ-50 and, if the need arises, services for the AN/TPQ-49 FMS customers. <br>  <br> Responses will consist of an unclassified white paper.  At a minimum, the white paper shall address issues a. though f. below: <br>  <br> a.	Quantities will vary depending on available funding and other factors.  Provide sufficient supporting documentation, to include an integrated schedule showing key events such as contract award, any development and/or facilitization, ramp up, test events and deliveries.  <br>  <br> b.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT / REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST (EOI)
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THIS RFI IS RELEASED PURSUANT TO FAR PART 15.201(E), EXCHANGES WITH INDUSTRY. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT AT THIS TIME.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has a need to establish a baseline for operational security awareness for the Waste Isolation pilot Plant and other operations for the Carlsbad Field Office. The current Operational Security Policy requires actions and general employee awareness to ensure the protection of critical information.  However, the security culture within WIPP operations does not appear to have matured beyond minimum requirements for the protection of sensitive information.  Since implementation of the current policy, work practices have evolved with changing technology, the old techniques for security awareness have proven to be too slow and inadequate to mitigate against growing security threats. The intent is to gather information without the knowledge of general management or staff.  Testing and evaluation should be planned to assess actual practices by WIPP employees performing normal duties.  This is not to be a test of tactical security responses or use of force. I nstead, this is an assessment of routine practices that should limit and control access to CBFO facilities to only authorized business. In addition, this is to also assess routine practices to limit and control sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information, sensitive operational information, or information technology control details.
Once identified, vulnerabilities and areas needing improvement need to be reported with recommended training plans designed to provide awareness level training for WIPP employees.  The final report is expected to provide CBFO a baseline rating of how operational security practices are maintained, a plan for training needs, and key indicators that can be assessed in the future to evaluate progress.  Therefore, the outside entity must possess requisite competencies that can test, evaluate, provide recommendations and provide responsive training in these unique areas.
The Contractor shall provide subject matter experts to perform testing and evaluation of current operational security practices.  They must provide CBFO a final report that identifies key areas needing improvement, and provide responsive training to address vulnerabilities in current practices.  The areas needing assessment include: ?	Control of information leakage through email phishing and spam ?	Control of information leakage through social interactions, telephone usage and social media ?	Access control of visitors, vendors and solicitors ?	Access control by security protective force and visitor interface
The contractor will be responsible for providing an approved plan to test and evaluation operation security practices for CBFO/WIPP operations. The contractor shall perform testing without alerting general staff of evaluation. After evaluating security practices, the Contractor shall prepare a detailed a report that identifies vulnerabilities, provides recommendation for corrective actions, provides a recommended training plan for long-term improvement of operational security practices, and provide responsive training to address immediate needs.
The contractor shall provide deliverables in accordance with the Reporting Requirements Checklist. ?	Pre-Penetration testing discussion ?	Approved ?Rules of Engagement? agreed upon by both parties ?	Prior to completion of testing, one initial out brief to the Security Officer ?	A draft written report within 30 days of completion of the Penetration Test to the Contracting Officer and Security Officer ?	Final report within 90 days of response and comments to the draft report ?	Final report will include recommendations of areas needing improvement, initial training plan to address those areas ?	Formal presentation of final report and findings to Security Officer
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these requirements is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting, and the small business size standard is $15 million. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT AT THIS TIME. The purpose of this announcement is to identify small disadvantaged business concerns under the Small Business Administration?s 8(a) program with the capabilities to perform the services described above. All interested 8(a) companies are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than ten (7) pages and no smaller than 12 pitch font. DOE will evaluate each capability statement based on the demonstrated experience and capability of the 8(a) firm and its partners, if applicable, in providing the required services.
After reviewing the capability statements received in response to this announcement, DOE may select one or more companies to participate in capability interviews to more fully assess the depth and breadth of each company?s experience and capability to provide the required services. As a result of the capability interviews, DOE anticipates the award of one contract under the Small Business Administration?s 8(a) program. 
DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation.  An interested party should avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the Systems and Software Assurance Services at the Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) at Fairmont, WV. <p> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Program is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses,  and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the Systems and Software Assurance Services (SAS) procurement.	The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. <p> SECTION 1  BACKGROUND <p> 1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION <p> The NASA IV&V Program provides assurance to its customers that their safety and mission-critical software will operate reliably and safely.  The IV&V Program strives to improve software safety, reliability, and quality of NASA programs and missions through effective applications of systems and software IV&V methods, practices, and techniques. The NASA IV&V Program applies software engineering best practices to evaluate the correctness and quality of critical and complex software systems throughout the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). <p> The NASA IV&V Programs analytical approaches enable efficient, cost effective system and software IV&V, safety and mission assurance services through the usage of broad-based expertise, adaptive software engineering best practices, and tools that are in place at the NASA IV&V Program.	The analytical paradigm utilized by the NASA IV&V Program requires a multi-disciplinary team, and a qualitative software risk and criticality assessment capability coupled with extensive multiphase, phase-independent analytical processes for the performance of IV&V as well as safety and mission assurance services. <p> IV&V has been demonstrated to be an effective technique on large, complex software systems to provide assurance that the software being delivered meets requirements and is safe, within cost, and on schedule.  When performed in parallel with the SDLC, IV&V provides for the early detection and identification of risk elements.  The NASA IV&V Program is then able to provide this information to the development organization, allowing them to take action to mitigate these risks early in the SDLC. Additionally, Information Assurance (IA) and other systems & software assurance activities such as reliability analysis, safety analysis, hazard analysis, independent testing and quality assurance generate additional technical evidence that a system and/or its software are ready for deployment and operation in a real-world environment. <p> The scope of work under consideration for purposes of this Request for Information (RFI) includes the performance of systems and software assurance services, including IV&V and safety and mission assurance analysis on selected systems and software being developed by or for NASA and other Federal, State and local government agencies and other entities. The current contract providing these services is NNG12SA03C which expires on May 10, 2017. <p> SECTION 2  SCOPE OVERVIEW <p> The following information is included as a description of the current KNOWN requirement scope: <p> Provide the personnel, materials, and facilities necessary to perform IV&V, safety and mission assurance services.  The IV&V services include, but may not be limited to: Verification and Validation of selected NASA software systems, system/software safety analysis, software reliability analysis, system/software hazard analysis, system/software quality assurance and software independent testing.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.
<p>The Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops and maintains the scientific competencies necessary to provide the nation with a central basis for uniform physical measurements, measurement methodology, and measurement services fundamental to the processing, characterization, properties and performance of materials, and to other essential areas in materials science.</p>
<p>As part of its mission, international activities are essential to promote the advancement of international standards and maintain relationships with NIST's sister institutions abroad. The Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS) is one such activity. The purpose of VAMAS is to develop the technical basis for international standards through collaborative research. Another activity is the World Materials Institute Forum (WMRIF), a body of executive leadership from publically funded materials research institutes around the globe and national measurement institutes aimed at fostering better international communication and scientific collaboration. The NIST MML Director will assume the Presidency of the WMRIF and related Secretariat duties in 2015. NIST is also playing a key management role in the VAMAS program.</p>
<p>NIST is contemplating the need to procure support for VAMAS international pre-standardization cooperative research activities as well as support for NIST's leadership of the WMRIF.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the need for a Contractor to provide professional services to organize and manage logistics for steering committee meetings, workshops, and general assembly meetings in support of NIST's participation in VAMAS and WMRIF.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Government anticipates the need for a Contractor to provide professional services in analyzing international standards documentation, and experience with developing international standards.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from Certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses. The NAICS code for this effort, 541690, and the size standard is $15.0M or less.</p>
<p>After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may award a contract to a certified active 8(a).</p>
<p>The following information is required to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br /><br />1. Any relevant documentation which demonstrates your company's overall capability with respect to working with technical international round robin testing programs, pre-standard test method development, and supporting various standard-setting bodies such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), International Standards Organization (ISO), and the Committee of European Normalization (CEN).</p>
<p>2. Your company's size classification and proof of active 8(a) certification.</p>
<p>3. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>Submission must be received via email to susan.ruzicka@nist.gov not later than 03 April 2015, at 3:30 PM Eastern Time.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in April.<br /><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for April is April 1, 2015 to April 7, 2015, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.<br /><br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced.<br /><br />If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /><br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /><br />DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Westchester County, Nassau County, or Suffolk County.<br /><br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /><br />LEASE TERM: Up to 10 years.<br />

<a href="mailto:heather.d.bauer@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Louisville</a>
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>  <br> Marine construction of river dikes approximately 750 to 1,250 ft. in length at river elevation 310.  Initial dike will be located approximately 600 ft. upstream of Olmsted on the Kentucky side.  Total of 14 dikes will be constructed at the Olmsted project site.   <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>  <br>  (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Louisville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to heather.d.bauer@usace.army.mil no later than by 10:00 AM EST on 13 April 2015. <br>

The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsible firms. Small business, Section 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB and EDWOSB businesses are highly encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking sources to include small businesses (an individual, a group of individuals or a business) for a service requirement entitled: Biological Studies to Evaluate New Turbines Designed for Safer Fish Passage at Ice Harbor Dam. A Firm Fixed Price contract may be issued at a later date.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification code (NAICS) 541712. The Small Business size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees as determined by 13 CFR 121.104. To make an appropriate acquisition decision for this project, the Government may use responses to this sources sought synopsis. The type of solicitation issued and the manner of advertisement will depend on the responses to this sources sought synopsis.</p>
<p>Professional Services in Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences:</p>
<p>The USACE, Walla Walla District, has collaborated, through a contract with Voith Hydro to develop the designs of a new fixed blade propeller and a new adjustable blade turbine runner to be installed at Ice Harbor Dam. These turbine runners were designed with biological criteria to be safer for fish passage.</p>
<p>Prior to installation, the USACE has a need to computationally evaluate the biological performance of the existing Kaplan, new adjustable blade and new fixed blade runners.<br /><br />1.0 Objectives<br />1. Establish the relative biological performance of two new turbine runner designs and compare performance to the existing Ice Harbor Turbine runner design. The biological performance assessment shall primarily consider the effects of pressure, shear and turbulence on Chinook salmon smolts.</p>
<p>2.0 Task Descriptions</p>
<p>Task 1 - Acquire the geometric design of the existing Ice Harbor Dam turbine Units 1-3 including the turbine intake, intake screens, scroll case, distributor, runner and draft-tube.</p>
<p>Task 2 - Acquire the geometric design of the new Ice Harbor Fixed Blade runner and new Ice Harbor Adjustable Blade runner including the modifications to the stay vanes, head covers, discharge rings draft-tube transition and draft tube. Acquire all appropriate non-disclosure agreements from the Turbine Manufacture of the new fixed and adjustable blade runners.</p>
<p>Task 3 - Construct a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model for three different turbine designs (existing, fixed blade and adjustable blade). The models shall replicate the prototype scale using steady state assumptions. The full 360 degree runner shall be modeled replicating all runner blades and utilizing a rotating frame of reference. The full intake with bypass screens as well as the draft tube (with associated hydraulic losses) shall be included in the CFD model. The final CFD model shall be capable of accurately modeling operating conditions determined by a physical performance model.</p>
<p>Task 4 - From the CFD model outputs determine the magnitude and frequency of nadir pressures for up to four turbine operating conditions of each design.</p>
<p>Task 5 - Conduct a Biological Performance Assessment of four individual conditions for each design. The Biological Performance Assessment shall determine relative estimates of pressure related mortality of juvenile salmonids, and shall provide a relative comparison of exposure to detrimental levels of shear and turbulence.</p>
<p>Task 6 - Investigate the sensitivity of outcome to sample sizes and sample injection locations for release of sensor fish and or live fish for future field testing of the three different prototype runners. <br /><br />Task 7 - Provide training of Government employees on the CFD and Biological Performance Assessment models and methods.</p>
<p>Task 8 - Provide a summary draft report summarizing methods, validation and results (see Deliverables below).</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT INQUIRY

The Department of Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office (NCO) 19, Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center (RMAC) is seeking information and sources that are capable of providing readjustment counseling service for the Kalispell Vet Center.  Contractor shall provide readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans located in rural communities where the veterans reside (greater than 50 miles from the nearest Vet Center) within the following counties: Lake, Lincoln, and Sanders; and in the cities of Polson or Ronan, Libby and Eureka, Plains or Thompson Falls. These services are performed for the Readjustment Counseling Services at the Kalispell Vet Center, located at 690 North Meridian, Suite # 101, Kalispell, Montana. 
The Contractor shall provide readjustment counseling services to veterans who are assigned to their care. The counseling shall include traditional psychotherapeutic modalities, but the purpose of psychotherapy (or any modality) must be, as a primary task, to address readjustment difficulties derived from military duties and the homecoming experience.
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:
The Contractor shall provide readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans referred by the Vet Center staff. Readjustment counseling, for purposes of this contract, is counseling provided by licensed mental health providers; clinical social workers, psychologist, or other qualified counselors that shall provide services specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral difficulties explicitly related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life. Such difficulties may interfere with a veteran's job performance, education pursuits, family and other interpersonal relations, or overall ability to cope with daily life. Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual, group and family counseling; all of which must have as their central purpose the post-war readjustment of war zone veterans. This service does not include general mental health services, but only provides readjustment counseling for psychosocial difficulties related to post-war readjustment from military duty, for example: 
1.	Exposure to combat-related war trauma.
2.	Exposure to other aspects of war zone stress.
3.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (as defined by the current DSM) or other war-related social and psychological difficulties.
4.	Stressors unique to military duty for eligible veterans.
5.	Psychological concern over a possible service-connected condition.
6.	Substance abuse connected with military duty and/or post-war homecoming and readjustment.
7.	Difficult post-war experiences, including disrupted homecoming and unsuccessful re-entry into civilian roles.
8.	Concern over possible Agent Orange, biological or chemical agent exposure or ramifications thereof.
9.	Generalized alienation from society manifested by lack of expectable familial, educational or vocational activities.
10.	Psychosocial difficulties related to type of military discharge for other than a dishonorable discharge.

The provision of medications and physical examinations are not to be considered a component of readjustment counseling, and therefore, will not be provided under this contract as a reimbursable service to the contractor. Nonetheless, offerors should have the capability through referral to arrange for needed physical examinations, prescription medications or other medical treatment. Contractor and Service providers submitting offers in response to this sources sought notice shall be physically located within the geographic boundaries for which the contract award is made. The boundaries described herein are determined by RCS and local VA officials, based upon "geographical areas of need" (e.g. a given city, county, or locality where a Vet Center is present but, because of a large veteran population, cannot adequately provide services).

The information submitted shall contain the company's business size status. The NAICS code is 621420, Alcoholism treatment centers and clinics (except hospitals), outpatient. This is a request for information and sources only, which may or may not lead to a future solicitation. This is not a request for proposal (RFP).  The VA will not pay for any information received resulting from this sources sought notice. Requests for copies of a solicitation shall not be honored or acknowledged. Information should be forwarded to the Contract Specialist. Any questions should be addressed to the Contract Specialist, in writing, at the email address provided. Because this is a request for information only, answers to questions will not be posted. If your organization is capable of providing these services and is interested in this opportunity, please respond to Shelly Johnstone, Contract Specialist, Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 19, 4100 East Mississippi Avenue, Suite 900, Glendale, Colorado 80246 or via e-mail at Shelly.Johnstone@va.gov with a statement describing your capabilities. The capability statement shall include a point of contact, complete mailing address, telephone number, email address and state the company's business size status. Any questions shall be addressed to the Contracting Officer, in writing, at the email address provided. Because this is a request for information only, answers to questions will not be posted. The deadline for this information is 4:30 PM Mountain Time, Tuesday, April 7, 2015.

The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veteran Point of Service (VPS) program 
Visa Services Assembler (VSA) VistA.js Pilot and Preparation for National Rollout
The purpose of this Source Sought Notice is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the requirement to assist in the development and positioning for rollout of a new platform for web service integration and data federation across the VA, which has been given the name internally of the "VSA (VistA Services Assembler) VistA.js Platform," or "VistA.js" for short.  VistA.js is a Node.js-based solution utilizing an add-in provided by InterSystems for fast, direct access to data and routines in a Cache database that aims to simplify how systems are integrated with VistA (and each other) and shall provide other powerful features like automated service generation and/or description, data aggregation (in support of various reconciliation use cases), integrated security (including single sign-on "SSO") and federated, high-speed, stateless, Remote Procedure Call Broker-less connectivity to VistA running at VistA sites in each of the four regions around the country.  See attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and draft Business Requirement Document (BRD).
As reflected in the VistA 4 Architectural documentation released by the VA on February 3, 2015, VistA.js shall also provide a roadmap for integration in support of the VSA run-time and Wizard functionality, in an interactive manner with the VSA team such that VistA.js supports the operational components of the targeted VSA requirements with respect to VSA run-time and the VSA Wizard, respectively.  
Any responses to this Request for Information (RFI) should also include a framework and identify an integration roadmap for utilization of the above-identified VistA.js features by the VistA Exchange architecture.  Responses to the RFI should include a Use Case utilizing the proposed VistA.js framework and support of VSA run-time and Wizard functionality, which Use Case shall include Veterans Point of Service (VPS) patient look-up, check-in, and medication reconciliation and allergy review ("MRAR").  
All responses shall include and specifically address how the proposed VistA.js framework adopts current VA standards for security technology and existing authentication frameworks, as well as identify how such proposed VistA.js frameworks will adopt future security and/or authentication standards (such as SAML tokens) which may be adopted by VA.  
VPS seeks to run a pilot in at least six sites across two different regions, during which the capability will be refined and improved through rigorous field testing, and prepared for national rollout. Depending on a number of factors, a partial rollout to two or more VISNs may take place by the end of 2015, although it is more important that the platform be fully vetted and stabilized before any rollout for production use. The goal of this preparation is to make the new platform ready for national rollout.
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  Do not submit a proposal or quote.  It is requested that all companies interested in participating in this effort please note their interest and provide information on their respective capabilities to perform the effort described in the attached draft BRD and PWS.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bids, Request for Quotations, or a Request for Proposal.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the VA in developing its acquisition strategy and Performance Work Statement.  This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.    Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.   Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   
The North American Industrial Classification for this effort is 541512.
If interested, please submit a Capabilities Statement, limited to ten (10) pages, single spaced, 12 point font for your company, your teammates and or subcontractors.  In addition, please address the following questions, limited to 40 pages (including diagrams), single spaced, 12 point font minimum:
1.      Provide, at a minimum, the following information in the initial paragraph of the submission:
 
o	Name of Company
o	Address
o	Point of Contact
o	Phone Number
o	Fax Number
o	Email address
o	Company Business Size and Status
o	NAICS code(s)
o	GSA and/or GWAC, if you are included in one or more. Please include Contract Number, expiration date, etc.
o	Socioeconomic data
o	Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number

2.  	Given the general possibility of Node.js connectivity to VistA running on Cache, please explain your knowledge and expertise related to Node.js and in particular the Cache.node add-in for Node.js. Your explanation should focus on specific qualifications and experience.
 
3.  	The possibility of direct access to VistA data other than through the RPC Broker theoretically opens the possibility of unlimited access to VistA data, anonymous access, etc. Explain your team's approach to solving this problem.
 
4.  	Detail how you would select pilot VAMC sites, in order to maximize the opportunity to test various aspects of the federation solution, and to expose it to the widest possible array of configuration challenges and other constraints or scenarios. What are the most important things you would want to get out of piloting such a solution, and what are the risks and limitations that need to be factored into the effort to roll the piloted solution out nationally?
 
5.  	How would you approach the problem of migrating existing systems, such as the VetLink Kiosk, VistA Imaging, and other RPC Broker-integrated systems, to the new platform?
 
6.  	Explain at a high level your understanding of the VA's recently released architectural Design Patterns, and how the VSA VistA.js Federation platform (as described here; http://www.osehra.org/sites/default/files/vista_4_product_architecture_v1-0_20150127.pdf) alleviates much of the current pain of integration with third party systems by design.
 
7.  	Please explain how you would integrate services and applications on the VSA VistA.js with both the current Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) workstation-based application, and with the future web-based Electronic Health Management Platform (eHMP).
 
8.  	Please describe your team's experience with respect to building, deploying, and maintaining distributed systems, with a particular focus on any relevant experience in the healthcare space.
 
9.  	Please address a possible schedule of work and how you would implement in a 6 month increment structure with the possibility of parallel increments. 
10.  	Please describe how your team would approach the task of implementing course-grained clinical write-back APIs with transaction support on VistA.js, including what work would need to be done in MUMPS (such as data standardization) to support it. What implications for the Clinical Reconciliation Service (CRS) referred to in the PWS might this approach have in terms of performance and scalability? 

11.       Please describe a strategy your team would employ to use mobile devices in the context of the VSA VistA.js Federation Platform to further the VPS's core mission statement? 
Additionally, please indicate if you, your teammates and/or subcontractors are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Small Business, or a Veteran Owned Small Business.  Please note VA118-15-N-0219 in the subject line of your response.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-272-9805<br />Name:		Envelope, Transparent, Large, 10" x 13", BX\100<br />Description:	Clear front and back, 10" x 13", flexible protector bound on 3 sides with sewn black plastic edging; 1/4" metal eyelet on unsewn side for hanging. UOI is HD.</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-9955<br />Name:		Envelope, Transparent, Large, 10" x 13", BX\25<br />Description:	Clear front and back, 10" x 13", flexible protector bound on 3 sides with sewn black plastic edging; 1/4" metal eyelet on unsewn side for hanging. UOI is BX. BX = 25 Envelopes</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-272-9805<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-9955<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ANG-1572; ESS-64209; CLI-46912; CLI-45912; CLI-80912</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than April 10, 2015 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission 's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>1. Contracting Agency: Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), 4800 Mark Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia 22350.
<p>2. Authority Cited: This document constitutes justification and approval of other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program and in accordance with 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(C). It is executed on behalf of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), Headquarters (Alexandria, VA), Procurement Division.</p>
<p>3. Description of the Supplies or Services required: DoDEA requires analyses of five of its remaining business units (Information Technology (IT), Communications, Procurement, Resource Management (RM) and Logistics (LOG)). Four of the five units will be reviewed at the Division level to include the IT, Procurement, RM and Communications Divisions. LOG will be reviewed at the Branch level which includes three separate Business Units (Services, Finance &amp; Administrative, and Facilities).</p>
<p>4. Description of the Action: DoDEA proposes to modify task order HE1254-14-F-0004, DoDEA's strategic rebalancing effort that focuses upon above school level organizational structure, by means of other than full and open competition to add the analysis of five business units. <br /><br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: Under task order HE1254-14-F-0004, BAH is to deliver a Business Case Analysis (BCA) for DoDEA's Rebalancing Initiative that meets Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE) specifications. However, accomplishing this will not be successful if DoDEA is unable to have a comprehensive analysis of all of its Business Units. At the onset of HE1254-14-F-0004, DoDEA experienced a change in directorship which resulted in a change in its rebalancing approach. Part of this change in approach increased the number of business units requiring analysis from 25 to 30. BAH has completed the analyses of 25 Business Units with 5 remaining. The analysis of the Education Directorate has required a much deeper level of review than originally anticipated prior to award. Due to these changes, the entire process will take longer than originally expected. In order to finalize the last deliverable (BCA) and provide DoDEA with a comprehensive BCA that can defend and meets CAPE standards, it is absolutely necessary that the remaining analyses of the 5 Business Units be completed. BAH has in-depth knowledge of DoDEA's rebalancing approach and is abreast with what data will be required to complete a thorough and prompt review of the remaining five Business units. Therefore, it is expected that by having BAH perform the remaining services DoDEA can alleviate greater delays and the possibility of inconsistences within the BCA. Use of another contractor would prove cost prohibitive because it would necessarily require duplicate effort and additional time for familiarization with the rebalancing approach and the completed analyses.</p>
<p>6. Effort to Obtain Competition /Action to Increase Competition: Follow on efforts will be competed as full and open competition among Federal Supply Schedule vendors.</p>
<p>7. Market Research: Market research was not conducted because BAH is the only known capable source with in-depth knowledge of required services that can provide uninterrupted support during the requested timeframe without causing additional burden on the government. They are fully staffed and in place to support this mission. Attempting to transition to a new vendor during this short time period would not be feasible or cost effective. Booz Allen Hamilton has been successfully providing this type of service to DoDEA.</p>
<p>8. Interested Sources: Booz Allen Hamilton is an interested source.<br /><br />In consideration of the work performed on the task order it is deemed more economical and efficient for DoDEA to modify the task order to BAH for the reasons as stated above. This modification represents the best value to the Government consistent with 8.404(d).<br />FSC/SVC is R499, NAICS Code is 541611, and Size standard is $14 Million.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals. Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space and Flight Center (GSFC) intends to award a fixed-price Purchase Order on a sole source basis to L-3 Communications for a Cadet Nanosat Radio, Part Number 5071-0001, CubeSat Integrated Communications System (CICS).

NASA will be utilizing the Cadet Radio on a Simulation to Flight-1(STF-1) CubeSat effort. This effort will be leveraging the flight software from the Dellingr mission and as a result, will reuse the radio flight software component.

Based on the above, it is concluded that our minimum needs are only reasonably available from the selected source. <p> The scheduled period of performance is 6 months and the total value of the order shall be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. <p> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <p> Interested organizations may submit their interest and capability by responding to this requirement by April 12, 2015, 5:00 pm Eastern time. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interest received on or before April 12, 2015 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document is available. <p> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

Sole Source Justification: The Government only knows of one responsible source, Optical Scientific, Inc. who is the original designer, patent holder and manufacturer of this equipment and they retain full proprietary rights to all related designs, drawings, schematics, software, etc. A Sources Sought was posted on Federal Business Opportunities on March 11, 2015 for 5 days and one response was received from a vendor who has not repaired these devices but would like the opportunity for a first article batch to see if they are able to repair them since they don't believe they would need any proprietary data to complete the repairs. We will send a limited requirement to this vendor to determine their repair capabilities but not this requirement due to currently zero in stock. Market Research: Multiple searches of the Small Business Administration (SBA) Dynamic Small Search did not identify any small business available to compete for this required repair service. Search parameters included a combination of NAICS code &lsquo;334513' with key words: &lsquo;repair, present weather, Optical Scientific'; and just key words: &lsquo;repair, present weather, Optical Scientific'; &lsquo;repair, present weather, LEDWI'; and &lsquo;repair, present weather, LEDWI sensor'. A search of "repair present weather sensor LEDWI Optical Scientific" and "repair present weather sensor" in GSA's eLibrary also returned no matches.

<SUBJECT>2015 JSOC Capabilities and Technology Expo (JCTE) Registration
<SOLNBR>RRTO-2015-03-27-W-JSOCJCTE-2ND-SPNOTICE
<RESPDATE>041515
<CONTACT>JCTE Team, Email osd.jcte@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>SYNOPSIS: 2015 JSOC Capabilities and Technology Expo (JCTE) Registration</strong> <br /><br />JSOC has assembled a SECRET listing of approximately 100 Special Operations Force (SOF) technology and capability needs. The first Special Notice posted 30 January 2015 made the list available for release to Industry, Academia, and National Labs beginning in February 2015.
<p>JSOC will follow up the release of the Needs List with two events through two additional special notices: one, a Capability Needs event to be held in Mclean VA on 29-30 April 2015 that will host up to 250 SECRET cleared Industry representatives each day to discuss this list of needs and potential opportunities to partner with industry to address them through Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs); and two, a Capability Solutions event to be held in October 2015 which will be a by invitation only event for selected Industry partners to present potential CRADA partnerships to JSOC representatives.</p>
<p><strong>A. INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>This notice is NOT a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) mission is to conduct studies; training; exercises; research, development, testing, and evaluation; and acquisition and procurement to ensure interoperability among special operations forces (SOF), general purpose forces, and interagency and foreign partners. JSOC has assigned and attached subordinate units and may deploy to support Geographic Combatant Commander's training, exercises, activities, and operations.</p>
<p>It is JSOC's desire to inform and influence industry's internal investment decisions in areas that address SOF's most sensitive and urgent needs. Many in industry have expertise, capacity, funding, and a desire to better understand and invest in SOF unique needs.</p>
<p>Factors that make this unique collaboration opportunity attractive include: <strong>1) Increasing Military Budget Austerity</strong> - SOF is a judicious transition partner whose future resourcing is the most well-preserved of the military Services. It is JSOC's desire to improve collaboration in an era where budget austerity tends to erect barriers to open communication; <strong>2) Intellectual Property (IP)</strong> - The commercialization of dual-use (government/ commercial) technology can reduce costs to the government, but government contracting IP clauses may restrict industry's ability to capitalize on their own IP. Our proposed collaboration model preserves and protects industry's ownership of their intellectual property; and <strong>3) No restrictions</strong> on future contracting opportunities. - Although SOCOM CRADAs are not an immediate money-maker for industry, our template includes specific verbiage that obviates any restrictions on industry's ability to leverage that experience to compete for related/ future SOCOM contracts.</p>
<p><strong>B. OBJECTIVE:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Special Notice is to notify Industry that registration for the 2015 JSOC JCTE at the Booz Allen Hamilton Facility in McLean VA on 29 or 30 April 2015 will open at noon EDT on 1 April 2015.</p>
<p>The CRADA relationship provides industry a more intimate "hands on" collaborative relationship with users, combat developers and program planners with the goal of speeding transition of capability from the laboratory to the field. The CRADA also offers enhanced IP protection for industry. "Designated under the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-502) (which amended the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-480)), a CRADA is intended to speed the commercialization of technology, optimize resources, and protect the private company involved. A CRADA allows both parties to keep research results confidential for up to five years under the Freedom of Information Act."</p>
<p>JSOC's Technology Needs listing includes multiple needs in each of the following functional areas:<br />&nbsp; 1. Breaching<br />&nbsp; 2. Communications<br />&nbsp; 3. Electronic Warfare<br />&nbsp; 4. Fire Support<br />&nbsp; 5. Information Technology<br />&nbsp; 6. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance<br />&nbsp; 7. Knowledge Management<br />&nbsp; 8. Lighten the Load<br />&nbsp; 9. Mobility<br />&nbsp; 10. Scalable Effects Engagement/Non-Lethal<br />&nbsp; 11. Power and Energy<br />&nbsp; 12. Soldier Survival<br />&nbsp; 13. Target Engagement<br />&nbsp; 14. Visual Augmentation<br />&nbsp; 15. Other Need Areas</p>
<p>JSOC does NOT anticipate issuing Requests for Proposals and/or awarding contracts as a result of this Special Notice. Instead, JSOC aims to work towards collaborative agreements with selected Industry partners as they develop proprietary technologies for the market which address specific JSOC technology and capability needs. JSOC anticipates entering into approximately 5-25 CRADA's. Under each CRADA JSOC will provide:</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1. A technical and programmatic POC <br />&nbsp; 2. Copies of any testing conducted<br />&nbsp; 3. A written JSOC Tech Assessment (JTA) summarizing our view of the technology and its potential to include candid non-attributable quotes from all assessors across the JSOC enterprise<br />&nbsp; 4. JSOC's highest level sponsorship for participation in a SOCOM Technical Experimentation event to demonstrate the technology to participants from the SOF community at large to include MARSOC, USASOC, WARCOM, AFSOC and the SOCOM HQ<br />&nbsp; 5. JSOC transition assistance</p>
<p><strong>C. EVENT SPECIFIC INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>All attendees must be U.S. citizens and possess a valid US security clearance at the SECRET level or above.</p>
<p>All cell phones, electronics, and bags will be collected prior to entering the Expo area.</p>

<p><strong>D. ATTENDEES:</strong></p>
<p>JSOC desires creative engineers, scientists, designers, technicians, system developers and project managers to attend this event. Highly qualified candidates should register early as space is limited.</p>
<p>All attendees must attend the introductory briefing by JSOC leadership at 0900 on the day of their attendance, either 29 or 30 April 2015.</p>

<p>There will be up to 250 confirmed Industry attendees permitted per day, and attendees can only attend one day of the event, either 29 or 30 April 2015. The registration website will provide further information for sending attendee security clearance information.</p>
<p><strong>F. SPECIAL NOTICE:</strong></p>
<p>JSOC will utilize contractor consultant/advisors to assist with the distribution of the 2015 Capabilities and Technology Needs List. All advisors shall comply with procurement integrity laws and shall sign non-disclosure agreements.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE), have requested this requirement to support the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) within the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Science (NAS) in convening a one-day planning meeting to explore the potential of a small consensus study to develop high-level guidelines for federal evaluation. <br /><br />The National Academy of Sciences was born in the travail of the Civil War. The Act of Incorporation signed by President Lincoln on March 3, 1863, established service to the nation as its dominant purpose. In 1916 the Academy established the National Research Council at the request of President Wilson to recruit specialists from the larger scientific and technological communities to participate in that work.<br /><br />Recognizing the value of scientific advice to the nation in times of peace as well as war, Wilson issued an executive order at the close of World War I asking the Academy of perpetuate the National Research Council. Subsequent executive orders, by President Eisenhower in 1956 and President Bush in 1993, have affirmed the importance of the National Research Council and further broadened its charter.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1) (i), competition is being restricted because the services required are available only from the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) within the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Science (NAS). CNSTAT has unique knowledge of and experience with statistical programs and uses of information for public policy on a wide range of subject matter including evaluation concepts, methods, and techniques. Building on the pre-existing work-such as Principle and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency-will enable CNSTAT to produce deliverables needed in a very time- and cost-saving manner under the guidance of a unique national body of experts. Award of any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the necessary requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, federal evaluation offices have issued statements of evaluation policies-ACF Evaluation Policy (2012); and U.S. Department of Labor Evaluation Policy (2013)-covering key topics such as scope of the policy, rigor, relevance, independence, transparency, and ethics. Likewise, the statutory independence of IES has enabled it to carry out credible, rigorous evaluations without political interference. Federal evaluators believe that additional guidelines could help to ensure that Federal program evaluations meet scientific standards, are designed to be useful, and are conducted and results disseminated without bias or undue influence. One potential element of such guidance for federal evaluation would be a volume modeled after the CNSTAT, Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency, currently in its 5th edition (National Research Council of the National Academies, 2013) and updated every 4 years at the beginning of a new administration or second term. Heads of several federal evaluation offices are interested in CNSTAT convening a planning meeting to develop a prospectus for a small consensus study that would develop a high-level set of guidelines that would help evaluation offices maintain standards for their programs across administrations and changes in political-level personnel. These include the heads of evaluation offices and agencies in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) and Administration for Children and Families (ACF); and the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of the Chief Evaluation Officer (CEO).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description:</strong> <br /><br /></span>The purpose of the contract is to support the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) within the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Science (NAS) in convening a one-day planning meeting to explore the potential of a small consensus study to develop high-level guidelines for federal evaluation. Together with the informal federal evaluation working group, CNSTAT will consider such meeting topics as the types of guidance relevant agencies are looking for; the range of subject matter to include in a "Principles and Practices" for federal evaluations; and the timing and scope of a panel study. Agenda topics for the meeting will likely include:<br /><br />&bull; A focus on high-level guidelines for "Principles and Practices for Federal Evaluation," similar to the level of Principles and Practices for a Statistical Agency. The focus will not include particular evaluation designs or methods. <br /><br />&bull; Potential subject headings for a document of "Principles and Practices for Federal Evaluation" and whether and how it makes sense to distinguish between principles and practices;<br /><br />&bull; Scope and audience for a guidance document. For example, discussion on whether a document of "Principles and Practices for Federal Evaluation" should be addressed to federal evaluations in the behavioral and social sciences and education, or expanded to include other areas, such as defense testing, environmental protection testing, transportation program evaluation, etc.;<br /><br />&bull; Differentiating "evaluation" from policy analysis and research and determining where performance measurement fits in; <br /><br />&bull; Scope and timing of a consensus study to develop a "Principles and Practices for Federal Evaluation" should the planning meeting conclude that such is warranted.<br /><br />Attendees for the planning meeting will include CNSTAT staff, members of working groups on federal evaluation, and five (5) to six (6) additional people whom the working group members identify to invite. CNSTAT staff will pull together background materials for the meeting, including the above-referenced evaluation guidance documents, background on why and how Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency came to be developed and how it has evolved over time, and other relevant material on evaluation principles and practices. Assuming the discussion supports going forward, the output from the planning meeting will be a draft prospectus for a consensus study to be separately approved by the National Academies and potential sponsor agencies.</p>

<p>SOF personnel are incredibly difficult and expensive to select and train, and - once operational - are imbued with incredible responsibilities in unpredictable and diverse situations. SOFware LLC's Assessment<sup>TM</sup> application seeks to mitigate the risks of making costly mistakes in the Selection and Assessment (S&amp;A) programs of SOF units.</p>
<p>What does Assessment<sup>TM</sup> do for SOF Selection and Assessment programs?<br />A successful S&amp;A program should accomplish several things:<br />-It should be based on, and systematically reinforce, the character profile of successful operators (e.g. stress-&shy;&#8208;tolerant, team-&shy;&#8208;oriented, high integrity, etc).<br />-Reliably reject candidates with insufficient capability and/or trainability. <br />-Reliably reject candidates with unsatisfactory character.<br />-Reliably select competent, trainable and high-&shy;&#8208;character candidates.<br />-Provide feedback on each candidate's strengths and weaknesses, both for the instructor cadre's use and, if desired, for the candidate's own use and growth.<br />-Identify those parts of the training curriculum where candidate performance is consistently poor. Such trends may indicate the training provided to the candidates needs to be improved.<br />-Facilitate many independent observations on candidate performance. Blind, independent assessment at first, rather than group discussions where the opinions of strong personalities overpower potentially more insightful assessments from quieter personalities.<br />-Facilitates assessment of each candidate from a 360-&shy;&#8208;degree perspective: from their instructors and peers and from the candidates themselves. SOFware's Assessment<sup>TM</sup> was designed with all of these requirements in mind. It is designed to optimize both candidate performance data capture and to then compile that captured data into insightful and effective reporting.</p>
<p>Candidate Performance Data Capture<br />An effective data capture tool requires two components: first, the tool must enable the right data to be captured and, second, it must make the data capture process easy and intuitive. A failure on either front will lead to inaccurate and incomplete conclusions about candidate suitability. On the first score Assessment<sup>TM</sup> is completely configurable - it enables the S&amp;A administrators to document the personality characteristics, training events, and standards of performance that they value and need to have measured. On the second front the grading workflows are designed to be intuitive and automated wherever possible, and are optimized for touch-&shy;&#8208;based mobile device (e.g., iPad) on-&shy;&#8208;the-&shy;&#8208;go data capture.</p>
<p>Insightful and Effective Reporting <br />Reams of performance data are only useful if they can be presented in graphic summaries that effectively and quickly reveal a candidate's strengths and weaknesses, both on an absolute scale and relative to his peers. Assessment<sup>TM</sup> provides exactly that. The reports cover both job performance and personal character. Individual candidate reports start at a high-&shy;&#8208;level aggregated view, but allow multiple levels of drill-&shy;&#8208;down to the very specific. These reports show the candidate's score; that score as a deviation (good or bad) from the unit's standard; the average score of his peers; and finally his percentile ranking within the class. Group leaderboard reports are also provided, allowing relative performance to be more easily discerned. All reports follow a consistent color scheme (green is good, red is bad) to allow decision makers to - at a glance - discern accurate understandings of a candidate's suitability. A report card is provided for each candidate as the one-&shy;&#8208;stop-&shy;&#8208;shop for accessing all relevant reporting on an individual.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications (Aug 2013) - Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (June 2005) apply to this Request for Proposal and the offeror must include a completed copy of these provisions with their proposal or indicate (with DUNS Number) that current information is available on the federal government website ORCA (htpps://www.sam.gov) The full text of these clauses and provisions may be accessed electronically at the website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database prior to award of a government contract.</p>
<p>The offeror may access the current replacement site for ORCA, the System for Award Management (SAM), at (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/)</p>

Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract. 
(c)	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.  The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
6.	SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

7.	LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
a.	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information.

The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621111 and the small business size standard is $11.0 million.<br /><br />PRICE SCHEDULE - OBSTETRICAL SERVICES, ARAPAHOE, WY:<br /><br />BASE YEAR: 52 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />OPTION YEAR ONE: 52 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />OPTION YEAR TWO: 52 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />OPTION YEAR THREE: 52 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />OPTION YEAR FOUR: 52 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />GRAND TOTAL: $____________________.<br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The performance of this contract shall be from June 1, 2015, through May 31, 2016, with four 12-month options. PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Obstetrical Services at the Wind River Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming. The contractor shall visit the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming one day every week between the hours of 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm. NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT: This procurement is a nonpersonal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. STATEMENT OF WORK: The contractor shall provide onsite services for an obstetrics clinic to outpatients scheduled by the Government physicians/providers at the Wind River Service Unit. The contractor shall visit the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming one day every week between the hours of 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm. During each clinic the contractor will see up to 24 patients scheduled by the staff of the Arapahoe Health Center or Fort Washakie Health Center. The contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination. The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings. The contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation in the patient's Electronic Health Record. The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management. The Government will provide space, nursing assistance, laboratory services, x-ray services, and pharmacy services. No other reimbursement such as transportation, food, lodging, fringe benefits or insurance will be authorized. Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government. Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change. The contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics, at no charge to the Government. Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower. The contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his/her care at his/her private office or at a local contract hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician. In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and the contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician. Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Chief Executive Officer. In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment. While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient's family, notification by the contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties. Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician. Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician. Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service facilities whenever possible. The contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the contractor. Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled. It shall be required that the contractor's private office and the hospital the contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle. The contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services. All new employees are required to take HIPAA and Information Systems Security Awareness (ISSA) training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter. The contractor will complete all mandatory Indian Health Service, Wind River Service Unit trainings annually. All contractors will be required to utilize the RPMS Electronic Health Record to document the patient's problem (IPL), patient progress notes, patient orders (lab, x-ray, and pharmacy), appropriate Contract Health Service (CHS) referrals and encounter coding. The contractor will be required to process all EHR notifications in a timely manner. The contractor will be required to attend Electronic Health Record training with the Clinical Applications Coordinator. This training will be scheduled during specialty clinic hours. All documentation in the Electronic Health Record must be done in a timely manner per Indian Health Service policy. The primary agent/official responsible for monitoring this procurement in a project officer capacity and who will be verifying that all supplies and/or services have been received and delivered will be JoLynn Davis, R.N., D.O.N., Clinical Nursing, Wind River Service Unit. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies.

The Contractor will be required to comply with the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, "Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors," and the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementation guidance for personal identity verification for all affected contractor and subcontractor personnel.

CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE: The COR shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractor's technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract. INVOICE SUBMISSION AND PAYMENT: The Contractor shall submit its invoice to the Director of Nursing at the Wind River Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Center, P.O. Box 128, Fort Washakie, Wyoming 82514. The Contractor agrees to include the following information on each invoice: (1) Contractor's name and address; (2) Contact name, title, and telephone number; (3) Contract Number; (4) Invoice number and date; (5) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed; (6) Remit to Address; (7) Taxpayer Identification Number (Employer Identification Number or Social Security Number); and (8) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number (to ensure payment is made to the correct bank account) and vendor mailing address, as provided in the System for Award Management (SAM), formerly known as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

The character and background investigations will be conducted by the Wind River Service Unit. Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the physician is allowed to work. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards.

The solicitation is restricted to 100% Small Business concerns. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-80. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621111 and the small business size standard is $11.0 million.<br /><br />PRICE SCHEDULE - NEPHROLOGY SERVICES:<br /><br />BASE YEAR: 12 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />OPTION YEAR ONE: 12 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />OPTION YEAR TWO: 12 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />OPTION YEAR THREE: 12 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br />OPTION YEAR FOUR: 12 Clinics @ $_______________ per Clinic = $____________________;<br /><br /><br />GRAND TOTAL: $____________________.<br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The performance of this contract shall be from May 1, 2015, through April 30, 2016, with four 12-month options.<br /><br />PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Nephrology Services at the Wind River Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Centers, Arapahoe and Fort Washakie, Wyoming. The contractor shall visit the Wind River Service Unit one day every month, &frac12; day per clinic. Clinics will be scheduled between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm at the Arapahoe Health Center and between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm at the Fort Washakie Health Center.<br /><br />NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT: This procurement is a nonpersonal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance.<br /><br />STATEMENT OF WORK: The contractor shall provide on-site services for a Nephrology clinic. The Nephrology clinic shall be held one day per month at each clinic. During each clinic the contractor will see up to15 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Center. The contractor shall visit the Wind River Service Unit one day every month, &frac12; day per clinic. Clinics will be scheduled between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm at the Arapahoe Health Center and between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:45 pm at the Fort Washakie Health Center. The contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination. The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings. The contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient's Electronic Health Record. The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management. The Government will provide space, nursing assistance, laboratory services, x-ray services, and pharmacy services. Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government. Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change. The contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics. The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his/her care at his/her private office or at a local contract hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician. Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower. In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and the contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician. Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Chief Executive Officer. In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment. While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient's family, notification by the contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties. Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician. Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician. Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible. The contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the contractor. Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled. It shall be required that the contractor's private office and the hospital the contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle. The contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services. All new employees are required to take HIPAA and Information Systems Security (ISSA) training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter. Computer access will not be granted until the ISSA training is complete. The contractor will complete all mandatory Indian Health Service, Wind River Service Unit trainings annually. All contractors will be required to utilize the RPMS Electronic Health Record to document the patient's problem (IPL), patient progress notes, patient orders (lab, x-ray, and pharmacy), appropriate Contract Health Service (CHS) referrals and encounter coding. The contractor will be required to process all EHR notifications in a timely manner. The contractor will be required to attend Electric Health Record training with the Clinical Applications Coordinator. This training will be scheduled during specialty clinic hours.

Box 128, Fort Washakie, Wyoming 82514. The Contractor agrees to include the following information on each invoice: (1) Contractor's name and address; (2) Contact name, title, and telephone number; (3) Contract Number; (4) Invoice number and date; (5) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed; (6) Remit to Address; (7) Taxpayer Identification Number (Employer Identification Number or Social Security Number); and (8) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number (to ensure payment is made to the correct bank account) and vendor mailing address, as provided in the System for Award Management (SAM), formerly known as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the physician is allowed to work.<br /><br />SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards.<br /><br />PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. <br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200106 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-80 effective 2 March 2015.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), AHI (Cage Code 3GSZ1). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />1) Requirements - HSCG38-15-Q-200106, for a list of required parts.<br />2) Terms and Conditions - HSCG38-15-Q-200106, for applicable clauses, instructions, and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  <br>    <br>  	HQ Army Materiel Command	  <br>  	Office of Command Counsel  <br>  	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401  <br>  	Ft.

<DESC>Questions and Answers (Solicitation VA249-15-Q-0381)
Question:
1.  I am confused by your statement concerning the NAICS code and size standard?
Answer:  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) provides uniformity and comparability in the presentation of statistical data. NAICS is based on a production-oriented concept, meaning that it groups establishments into industries according to similarity in the processes used to produce goods or services.  The NAICS size standard for 812332 - Industrial Launderers is 38.5M.  A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs. For the most part, size standards are the average annual receipts or the average employment of a firm.  For further information concerning the NAICS code and size standard, please visit https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/Size_Standards_Table.pdf 
Question:
2.  Is this RFQ a small business set-aside?
Answer:  This RFQ is for Full and Open Competition, not a Small Business Set Aside.	

Please note: The time frame for submitting questions in regards to this solicitation has closed. The closing date and time was March 27, 2015 at 11:00 am CST - NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-(SSSA)-15-178 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). <br />This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.<br />The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-80 effective March 2, 2015. <br />This acquisition is set aside 100% for small businesses. The associated NAICS code is NAICS 334310 (the small business size standard is 750 employees). <br /> <br />STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this upgrade is to modify the current conference room equipment from an outdated analog A/V system to an up-to-date digital A/V system.  <br />Title: NSC/2172 Conference Room A/V System Upgrade<br />The NSC/2172 conference room was last modified in January of 2011.  The current state of the conference room uses analog audio and standard definition video technology.

With this digital upgrade, we will be upgrading video from standard definition (SD) to high definition (HD).  The upgrade will also introduce new microphones to address audio reinforcement issues.  A new DSP will be introduced to address audio reinforcement support as well as provide the correct parameters for the microphone and speaker audio levels. This upgrade will also introduce a new control system, a new video conferencing codec and other equipment to bring the system up to date.<br />Scope of Work<br />The proposed upgraded A/V system should be designed and installed to meet the below requirements.

<p>TITLE: Aerial Layer Communications</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA RIK-14-06</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this BAA for research, design, development, concept testing, evaluation and experimentation of technologies/techniques for airborne networking and the development and demonstration of mid-altitude aerial layer communication technologies and concepts.</p>
<p>The characteristics of today's aerial layer networks are limiting our combat effectiveness, especially in contested, degraded, operationally limited (CDO), and anti-access area denial (A2/AD) environments where studies have shown that we may be unable to maintain communication availability, and will be outnumbered/outgunned if the status-quo is maintained.</p>
<p>Major challenges include the transformation of the attributes of today's networks to the attributes of the desired network as shown below, while maintaining interoperability.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today's Network Attributes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desired Network Attributes</span> <br />Platform- and link-centric&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Network-of-networks centric<br /><br />Self-contained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open<br /><br />Preplanned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flexible and Ad Hoc<br /><br />Contains components designed for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains components designed for <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wired</span> and/or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">static</span> applications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wireless</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dynamic</span> applications<br /><br />Demos done on specific platforms <br />requiring modification&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demos performed on PODs</p>
<p>In addition, adequate capabilities for airborne network management are lacking today and there is a need in the community for solutions to manage and plan both today's multi-information link based airborne network environment and tomorrow's heterogeneous based architectures. Furthermore, a lack of dexterous network management and recovery mechanisms makes it hard to provide the necessary level of network reliability and survivability at the battlefield. This is nowhere more factual than in A2/AD environments where the ability to make rapid adaptations based on the situation is crucial.</p>
<p>This BAA seeks white papers that have a goal to improve the network, and cause the network to become a force multiplier. A force multiplier is a capability that, when added to and employed by a combat force, significantly increases the combat potential of that force and thus enhances the probability of successful mission accomplishment. Example areas of interest are:</p>
<p>1. Secure, Dynamic, ad-Hoc, Adaptable, and Programmable Aerial Mesh Networks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Routers and Security Devices<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Software Defined Networking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Reconfigurable Protocols for Self-healing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Network Coding<br />2. Network Resource Management<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Joint Network Situational Awareness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Integrated Network Operations<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Deliberate, Pre-mission, and Crisis Planning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Machine-to-machine C2 Interfaces<br />3. Modularized/Open Architecture Information Links/Networks/System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. AntTx/Rx Module<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Waveform Module<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Network Module<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Security Module<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Information Management Module<br />4. IP Communication Networking<br />5. Distribution and Range Extension <br />6. High Capacity Backbone<br />7. Network Enabled Weapons Information Links/Network<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Airborne Connectivity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Modularized/Open Architecture<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Cooperative Control<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. CONOPS<br />8. Command and Control of Directional Networking</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section IV, Paragraph 6 of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>

<p>TITLE: Airborne Connectivity and Dissemination</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-08</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSERTION (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this BAA for research, design, development, test, evaluation and experimentation of innovative technologies and techniques for Airborne Network Connectivity and Dissemination.</p>
<p>The objective of the BAA is to conceive, develop and demonstrate innovative and affordable technologies that provide agile and secure information transmission, network and dissemination capabilities to airborne platforms that enable the sharing of quality information within resource and policy constraints. The intent is to expand the Global Information grid (GIG) to connect three major domains of warfare: Air, Space, and Terrestrial. The goal is to deliver timely, reliable, and actionable information to war-fighters and systems across the United States Air Force enterprise to support Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Efforts under this program are expected to enable the Air Force to provide a transportable network, flexible enough to communicate with any air, space, or ground asset in the area. The network will provide a beyond line-of-sight (LoS) communications infrastructure that can be packed up and moved in and out of the designated battle-space, enabling the military to have a reliable and secure communications network that extends globally. The network is designed to be flexible enough to provide the right communication and network packages for a specific region, mission, or technology.<br />White papers may describe but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Hardware brass-boards and/or software systems development. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Activities for validation with model-based design and simulation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Demonstration of hardware brass-boards and antenna in-the-loop validation techniques.</p>
<p>Research efforts under this program are expected to result in functional capabilities, concepts, theory, and applications addressing Air Force airborne network connectivity problems. The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through testing and evaluation activities. Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use are of high interest. Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work effectively.<br /><br />Work is encouraged in, but not limited to, these focus areas:</p>
<p>1. Airborne Network Architecture</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Develop network architectures that support self-organizing, self- healing autonomous machine-to- machine data routing and dissemination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Develop self-aware/sentient cross-Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer network communications paradigms that support cooperative learning and reconfiguration-on-the-fly of mobile networks, by sensing and adapting to operational environment and mission requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Demonstrate cooperative wireless network communications that allow nodes in a wireless network to share resources and to cooperatively transmit, providing reliable, robust connectivity via multipath routing.</p>
<p>2. Information Transport Performance Management</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Develop the communications management capabilities to support the management of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) related network and information system and communications resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Develop information management algorithms capable of dynamically requesting data from multiple ISR sensors in order to enhance current capabilities for detecting, locating, identifying, and tracking ground moving targets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Develop the mechanisms to enable mission-based priority schemes and assured information delivery techniques supporting the exchange of ISR traffic, as well as other network traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Develop metrics such as Kill Chain Reduction, Bandwidth Efficiency, or Network Availability to gauge performance and effects.</p>
<p>3. Integration and Interoperability with the Global Information Grid (GIG)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Integrate new communications resources available on the ISR platform(s), to enable increased communications capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Study potential ISR collection planning and envisioned dynamic tasking techniques being developed for current and future Air Operations Centers (AOCs). Develop the information management algorithms to ensure they will operate within the constraints of these envisioned collection management techniques.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) In conjunction with the Government, work with the operational community to address Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) issues associated with ISR platform interoperability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Conduct airborne flight experiments utilizing multiple ISR assets aimed at demonstrating capabilities for increasing multi-platform interoperability and tracking performance.</p>
<p>4. Advanced Tactical Data Links (ATDL)</p>
<p>Tactical Data Links (TDL) are used in both peace time and combat environments to exchange information such as fixed formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free text messaging and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs increase mission effectiveness, providing enhanced situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, and digital machine to machine target and threat information sharing, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. In combat TDLs enable engagement of high-value, time-critical targets in anti-access/area-denial environments. TDLs are used by all Service Theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: White papers and proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit --The approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approach for evaluation of the technology.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.<br /><br />All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET/SCI information at the time of award. The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process.</p>
<p>5. SUPPLY CHAIN RISK: The provision at DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk (Nov 2013) applies.</p>

<DESC><br /><strong>AMENDMENT 8 to BAA RIK-14-01</strong>
<p>TITLE: Full Spectrum Targeting (FST)</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to make the following changes:</p>
<p>A) SECTION I, "Funding Opportunity Description" is changed to emphasize areas if interest and remove focus areas that are currently not of interest to the Government. <br /><br />B) <strong>SECTION VII, "Agency Contacts" has been revised to add a new technical point of contact.</strong></p>
<p>No other changes have been made.</p>
<p>SECTION I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:</p>
<p>Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers pertaining to the research, development, prototyping, integration, test and demonstration of innovative technologies, tools and practices to advance the future of the Air Force's targeting capabilities. The synergetic integration of kinetic and non-kinetic targeting across a distributed targeting enterprise will support a unified and continuous approach to analyzing a full spectrum of targets and spheres of influence (Air, Space Cyber and Social-Economic).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span>: The Joint Targeting Cycle is the process that is used consistently across organizations that perform targeting-related tasks. This process consists of six phases:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) End State/Commander's Objectives; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Target Development &amp; Prioritization; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Capabilities Analysis; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Commander's Decision and Force Assignment; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Mission Planning &amp; Force Execution; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Assessment</p>
<p>The targeting enterprise lacks efficient workflow and data hand-offs, causing lost time, redundancy of effort, and lesser quality products and effects across air, space, &amp; cyberspace. The major processes and products relevant to target intelligence production include: Target Systems Analysis (TSA), Intermediate/Advanced Target Development (I/ATD) (Encompassing imagery preparation, target description and significance, Precise Point Mensuration (PPM), and weaponeering), Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE), Electronic Target Folder (ETF), Target Lists (TL) and Battle Damage Assessment (BDA). Development of portions or all of these intelligence products, specifically TSA, I/ATD, CDE, and BDA, are not automated and required considerable resources (time and labor) to produce. Due to the lengthy, disjointed workflow, lack of an automated production process, and limited analytical tools, these processes and accompanying products are also pre-disposed to high error rates and low production capacity. Additionally, a significant deficiency in the current Joint Targeting Cycle is the absence of non-kinetic data in the targeting products throughout. In order to synergize planning and effects across a multi-domain environment, it's essential for FST to include the full range of Cyber, Space, Directed Energy, Electronic Warfare (EW), and influence operations (e.g. Psychological Operation (PSYOPS)/ Military Information Support Operations (MISO)) data into a universal targeting workflow.</p>
<p><strong>PRIMARY FOCUS: Automated Battle Damage Assessment (BDA)</strong></p>
<p>Assessing the effects of actions against targets of interest has always played a key role so that the commander could observe all developments as they occurred. As modern warfare has progressed battle damage assessment (BDA) has become more complicated. We are at a critical junction when more and more support is given of the concept for full spectrum operations. The commander cannot utilize non-kinetic options if he cannot assess their effectiveness. Current Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) tools are insufficient and complex. The Air Force must ensure it is fully capable of conducting kinetic and non-kinetic targeting across the full spectrum of warfare including irregular, unconventional, asymmetric warfare and traditional conflicts. Current BDA lacks non-kinetic assessment and incorporation of non-kinetic data into kinetic effectiveness assessment (i.e. did a bunker strike prevent communications?). Little support is provided to allow the targeteer an understanding of the ramifications or unintended effects due to the interdependencies between the physical, social and behavioral aspect of a region or nation in terms of performing the assessment function. The BDA tools need to include capability to feed into restrike recommendations and retasking in an automated fashion. We seek new technologies and tools that will illustrate how non-kinetic data will improve the overall BDA process and address all of the deficiencies outlined.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI seeks new technologies and tools to illustrate automated BDA with both kinetic/non-kinetic options over three phases. BDA Phase 1 is related to physical damage assessment estimates which are primarily based on visual observation. <strong>The Government is NOT interested in analyzing imagery</strong>. The focus is on helping with BDA Phase 2 related to functional damage assessment and BDA Phase 3 target system assessments (i.e. instead of confirming that the target is hit with a bomb [BDA Phase 1] we want to say whether target is still operational or not [BDA Phase 2] and whether the overall target system is functioning [BDA phase 3]). Challenges include but not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Lack of non-kinetic modules that can benefit the analyst for cyber, EW, and other types of non-kinetic data as well as how the data for these modules will be stored and accessed by systems of record like JTT or other interfaces (need to consider for example CNODB for cyber, EWIRDB database for EW, and others).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Non-kinetic data is not being utilized for BDA. As a result critical information that can specifically aid in determining whether the target solution set is generating the desired overall effects is being lost.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Need for interfaces for generating and displaying BDA reports that have non-kinetic data. Need to illustrate how much faster and more accurate such reports are due to having non-kinetic data.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Cohesive assessments and decision support to measure success or failure to achieve the desired effect against individual targets and to facilitate comprehension of the total damage to entire target sets and systems<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Timely determination of the campaign plan success (planned objectives versus actual results) achieved by the overall operation as measured over all friendly action against the adversary<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The application of Kinetic and Non-Kinetic weaponeering solutions will require the development of innovative Multi-INT information fusion algorithms to support BDA<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Investigate and recommend a Cognitive Workflow Process for the production of BDA products <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Automated restrike recommendations based on unsuccessful targeting effects</p>

Part 2 release is as follows:  <br>    <br>  1)Part 2 will consist of DRAFT versions of all Sections A through K of the uniform contract format.

Lastly, Attachment 0001 (formerly Attachment 0042 Section B CLIN Structure); Attachment 0002 (formerly Attachment 0043 Section B Labor); and Attachment 0003 (formerly Attachment 0044 Other Direct Costs for Cost Reimbursement) remain the same as in the Part 1 FBO release of the Draft FIRECON-F RFP and will be reattached with their revised numbers in this Part 2 release.  <br>    <br>  2)To obtain a full Technical Data Package (TDP) to be mailed in DVD format please refer to Section A of the DRAFT FIRECON-F RFP W15QKN-14-R-0159 on the bottom of page 3 titled  quote mark Limited Distribution Data Information Instructions quote mark .

<DESC>Amendment A0001 <br>  <br> 1.0	Purpose <br> Call W911W6-15-R-0009, Adaptive Engine Exhaust Signature Suppression, issued under Master Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W911W6-15-R-0004, solicits concept papers for development of an  quote mark adaptive quote mark  Infrared (IR) engine exhaust signature suppression system capable of meeting anticipated survivability requirements to be levied upon the Army's next generation, Future Vertical Lift (FVL) classes of aviation platforms.  The primary focus of the effort will be to explore and demonstrate innovative, advanced engine exhaust signature suppression concepts which can adaptively provide optimized  quote mark flight regime or threat regime quote mark  defined operational performance characteristics required to meet the needs of the joint warfighter into the next century.  While the fundamental focus is toward future vertical lift aircraft systems of various size classes the  quote mark Adaptive Engine Exhaust Signature Suppression quote mark  concepts explored should implement scalable approaches as to allow exploitation / implementation on legacy rotary wing aircraft systems as well.  <br>  <br> The adaptive IR suppression concepts shall be designed to operate within a broad range of suppression levels and associated parasitic engine performance losses. The system shall be designed to operate in a minimum of two functional suppression modes.  Mode 1 will provide minimal engine and aircraft platform aero/thermodynamic performance impact through configuration in a minimally suppressed configuration (clean aerodynamic flow path).  Mode 2 will provide maximized engine exhaust suppression of both hot exhaust components (line of sight exposure) and exhaust plume contributors through integrated reconfigurable flow path components.  Significant parasitic engine / airframe parasitic performance impacts associated with the Mode 2 operational configuration are anticipated, however, must be rationally minimized and should be consistent with existing suppression concepts. Developed Mode 2 system attributes shall focus on maximized reduction of engine associated IR signature characteristics (direct line of sight and exhaust plume radiance) within the 1.0 - 12 micron bandwidth.  <br>  <br> 2.0	Background <br> Current engine exhaust signature suppression systems are fixed mode and suffer from significant parasitic thermo / aerodynamic performance losses robbing the aircraft system of power and fuel efficiency throughout the aircraft's entire flight profile and mission duration.  Also, since aerothermodynamics engineering tradeoffs are conventionally necessary to balance aircraft performance with signature suppression performance, the ultimate survivability of the integrated aircraft system is not as effective as it could be.   <br>  <br> As Army aviation looks forward to emerging mission requirements that mandate flying further and faster (ref. JMR / FVL CONOPS) while carrying more functional payload, it has become apparent that novel approaches to reducing the signature attributes of these aircraft are critical in order to improve the survivability of these platforms.  In concert, these same technological advances in engine signature suppression and fuel/power performance should be comparably adaptable to existing fleet aircraft and can significantly extend the tactical relevance and performance of these platforms in the modern battlefield. <br>  <br> 3.0	Scope of Research Effort  <br> The solicited research effort encompasses the development of advanced engine exhaust plume and engine hot metal signature suppression concepts which enable  quote mark in flight quote mark  selection of suppression modes.   <br> This effort will focus on the development of technologies which will provide the means to configure the exhaust system for minimal performance decrement when signature suppression is not required (i.e. - non threat environment), and  quote mark on command quote mark  reconfigure to a high suppression effectiveness configuration, although be it higher engine performance loss, when maximum signature suppression is anticipated (i.e. - threat laden environments). <br>  <br> The Government anticipates this effort to be executed in two phases.  The Phase 1 will involve conceptual and detailed engineering design; aero / thermo modeling and simulation; and theoretical performance analysis.  Phase 2 will focus on the fabrication, assembly, instrumentation, static operational engine tests and performance characterization of a prototype Adaptive Engine Exhaust Suppression system.  Offerors shall assume that any operational (ground/flight) demonstrations shall be executed utilizing a surrogate, Government provided, demonstration powerplant such as the T700-GE-701 engine and a surrogate demonstration platform such as the UH-60 or AH-64 aircraft, as no FVL class aircraft will be available.  A Government furnished T700-GE-701D engine will be utilized by the Government for the Phase 2 static engine test and evaluation activities to be executed at the Government's test facility with contractor/recipient providing technical support.  A follow on Phase 3, which may be executed strictly at the Government's discretion based upon its assessment of the results of Phase 1 and 2, would involve the fabrication and integration of a flight worthy, adaptive system onto either a Government furnished UH-60, or AH-64, class aircraft platform.  Integrated flight test evaluation will focus on demonstration and assessment of  quote mark in-flight quote mark  operational performance of the Adaptive Engine Exhaust Suppression prototype conceptual hardware.   <br>  <br> 4.0	Performance Objectives and Technical Constraints <br>  <br> 4.1	Overall Concept of Operations <br> This advanced concept development effort will focus on the development of advanced engine exhaust plume and engine hot metal signature suppression concepts which enable  quote mark in flight quote mark  selection of suppression modes.  This effort will provide the means to configure the exhaust system for minimal performance decrement when signature suppression is not required ( i.e. - non threat environment), and switch to a high suppression effectiveness configuration, although be it higher engine performance loss, when maximum signature suppression is needed ( i.e. - threat laden environments). <br>  <br> 4.2	Threat Environment <br> Advanced rotary wing aircraft will be required to operate in threat environments rich in sophisticated missile threat systems such as MANPADS and cuing EO/IR sensor systems.  This is driving the thrust to significantly reduce the broad spectrum signature of airborne platforms in order to mitigate adversary engagement opportunities, impede the threat systems ability to detect, track the aircraft, while improving the ability of imbedded aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) to protect the aircraft.  <br>  <br> 4.3	Operating Constraints (Current Technology Shortfalls) <br> Current engine exhaust signature suppression systems are fixed mode systems and suffer from significant parasitic thermo / aerodynamic performance losses robbing the aircraft system of power and fuel efficiency.  Also, since aerothermodynamics engineering tradeoffs are conventionally necessary to balance aircraft performance with signature suppression performance, the ultimate survivability of the integrated aircraft system is not as effective as it could be and thus survivability compromised. <br>  <br> 4.4	Desired Objective Capabilities <br>  <br> 4.4.1	Concept of Operation	 <br> For conceptual purposes the adaptive suppression can be considered to be an ON or OFF system.  Fundamentally when the suppression system is in the  quote mark OFF quote mark  configuration, the engine system will operate at maximum thermodynamic efficiency with absolute MINIMAL impact on power and fuel efficiency - thus maximizing the aircraft's payload and range capability.  In the  quote mark ON quote mark  configuration adaptive suppression system shall aeromechanically reconfigure the exhaust flow path with a twofold operational objective.  First, in the adaptive configuration the system shall perform achieve significant reduction of the engine exhaust gas temperature prior to entering unconstrained flowfield around the aircraft.  Second, the adaptive suppression system shall be structured to control direct exposure to  quote mark hot quote mark  components.  Surface exposure control shall assume viewability from all tactical exposure aspect angles.  <br>  <br> 4.4.2	Engine Performance Impacts <br> The adaptive engine suppression shall induce a loss of no more than 0.5% increase fuel consumption across the power spectrum while in the  quote mark OFF quote mark  condition and shall not exceed 4% while in the actuated  quote mark ON quote mark  configuration.  As conventional engine exhaust suppression systems are utilized to provide engine bay cooling flow, the conceptual suppression systems shall be capable of maintaining adequate engine bay pumping in both configuration modes.  For engineering design purposes, the adaptive suppressions system concepts will be derived around the baseline T700-GE-701D flow class engine with platform integration on a UH-60 or AH-64 class aircraft. A Government furnished T700-GE-701D engine will we utilized by the Government for Phase 2 static engine test and evaluation activities. <br>  <br> 4.4.3	Conceptual Air vehicle Integration Considerations <br> The adaptive engine exhaust concept design shall take into consideration and assess the effects external integrated aerodynamic drag, momentum losses, etc may have a conceptual aircraft in both actuation modes. <br>  <br> 4.4.4	Scalability <br> In an effort to fully exploit the benefits of an adaptive engine exhaust system across the spectrum of rotary wing aircraft platforms, the conceptual suppression systems shall utilize design concepts which are readily scalable and engineered for turboshaft engines between the 10 - 30 PPS size class engines. <br>  <br> 4.4.5	Non- Conventional Technology Considerations <br> While the core area of interest focuses on advancement of more conventional aero / mechanical configurations, consideration will be provided for non- conventional or hybridized concepts such as innovative energy recuperative or recovery concepts, specialized material systems, etc.  All concepts must however be shown to be shown to be meritorious from the standpoint of total signature suppression capability as well as fuel consumption / weight / power parametrics.  <br>  <br> 4.4.6	Size and Weight  <br> While not to be specified at this time, concepts should be weight competitive with conventional suppression systems utilized on current fleet rotary wing aircraft systems and shall be minimally intrusive to the aerodynamically flow field around the aircraft. <br>  <br> 4.5	System Performance <br>  <br> 4.5.1	Mission Scenarios <br> This effort will provide the means to configure the exhaust system for minimal performance decrement when signature suppression is not required (i.e. - non threat environment), and switch to a high suppression effectiveness configuration, although be it higher engine performance loss, when maximum signature suppression is needed (i.e. - threat laden environments). <br>  <br> 4.5.2	Compatibility and Interoperability <br> In an effort to fully exploit the benefits of an adaptive engine exhaust system across the spectrum of rotary wing aircraft platforms, the conceptual suppression systems shall utilize design concepts which are readily scalable and engineered for turboshaft engines between the 10 - 30 PPS size class engines.  Extrapolation of developed concepts towards adaptation to a  quote mark common core quote mark  system which could readily exploited by multiple aircraft system will be considered. <br>  <br> 4.5.3	Air vehicle and Human Interface Considerations <br> For the purpose of the concept development and engineering performance evaluation, the suppression configuration modes may be tested in fixed, however, adjustable actuation presets.  Ultimately the adaptive system shall be configured with interactive actuation mechanisms capable of reconfiguration between the  quote mark OFF quote mark  and  quote mark ON quote mark  configuration modes and shall be manually controlled. <br>  <br> 5.0	Application and Submission Information Call Specific: <br>  <br> This call will use the Two-Step, White paper/Proposal Submission Process as described in Section 5.1 of the BAA  quote mark Solicitation Number: W911W6-15-R-0004 quote mark  and as further supplemented below: <br>  <br> 5.1	Due Date for White Papers: <br>  <br> White papers shall include the following: 1.

Offerors can contact ADD-AATD to ask for solicitation clarification.  All questions must be emailed to the Contracting Officer at elizabeth.a.jackson.civ@mail.mil.  Questions received less than one week prior to the proposal receipt date may not be addressed.  Oral explanations or instructions given before the award of any agreement/contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective Offeror concerning this BAA, which is necessary in submitting an offer or the lack of which would be prejudicial to any other prospective Offeror(s), will be published as an amendment to this BAA.  Offerors should be alert for any amendments to this BAA. <br>  <br>  <br> 5.2	Two-Step, White paper/Proposal Submission Process  <br> A Call using the two-step white paper/proposal submission process will require interested parties to submit a white paper for Government evaluation. For those white papers the Government evaluates as being scientifically meritorious and affordable, the Government will invite the offeror to submit a full proposal. The request may ask for either a portion of the proposed research effort or the full effort based upon the Government's evaluation of the white paper. <br>  <br> 5.2.1	First Step.  <br> Individual Calls will establish the desired research and development topics along with a date for submission of a white paper. Each white paper shall address only a single topic area and proposed research effort. Offerors may submit more than one white paper, but as stated each white paper can only address a single proposed research effort. The white paper shall follow the following format:  <br>  <br> Paper size: 8.5-by-11-inch paper  <br> Spacing: Single-spaced  <br> Margins: One-inch margins  <br> Font: Times New Roman, not smaller than 12 point  <br> Number of pages shall be limited to 10 pages including text and graphics.  Sources can include a one page cover letter that will not count towards this page limitation.  Pages in excess of the page limitations will not be read or evaluated. <br>  <br> 5.2.2	Second Step.  <br> Upon completion of Government evaluation of the white papers, the Government will request full proposals from only those offerors whose white papers were evaluated as meritorious under the evaluation criteria and funding is anticipated to be available. The offerors that receive such a request for full proposals will provide a proposal that is consistent with the format specified in paragraph 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of the Master BAA. The Government will only award upon determination that sufficient Government funding is available and agreement with the offeror upon an acceptable technical approach, terms and conditions, and an affordable cost. <br>  <br> 5.3	Period and Place of Performance.  <br> The period of performance for this effort will not exceed 20 months from the date of contract award.  All engineering design, analysis, and prototype manufacturing will be performed at the contractor-designated site(s).  Phase 2 activities involving operational testing of prototype suppression system hardware will be conducted at the Government's Countermeasures Test Facility located at Fort Eustis, Virginia.  The Government will provide test cell facilities (including a T-700 engine and related support), test cell instrumentation data acquisition (pressure, temperature, and radiometric) and nominal integration support. Anticipated award for the Phase 1 and 2 activities is expected during 4th quarter of Government FY15, subject to the availability of funds. <br>  <br> 5.4	Funding.   <br> Award of selected concept proposal(s) will be subject to availability of funds.  The Government anticipates multiple awards of phase 1 and phase 2 design, fabrication, and test efforts, however, reserves the right for awards to only one or none, based upon the technical merit and affordability of received technical proposals. The government anticipates fully funding the Phase 1 and 2 efforts under FY-15 6.2 RDT&E funding and have estimated an award instrument execution cost of $1,188,400 across all awarded actions. <br> The Government prefers Offerors propose a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2358) and Chapter 1, Subchapter C of Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations Section 37 (Reference (b)) and Chapter XI of Title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (Reference (c)), which is more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  This does not preclude other funding instruments from being used.  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented.  Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) is also an acceptable funding instrument.  TIAs are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  10 U.S.C. 2371 requires recipients to cost share at least 50% of the estimated cost of OTs.  For TIAs or OTs, it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of at least half the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the 32 CFR CH I, Section 37.530.  No fee or profit is allowed with this type of instrument.  The type of funding instrument is a subject for negotiation, but the Offeror's desire shall be clearly stated in the cost proposal.   <br> The Government reserves the right to select for award all or part of any proposal received.  Partial awards are conditioned upon the Government and the offeror reaching mutually agreeable terms for such partial awards. <br>  <br> 5.5	Required Government Facilities, Property, and Data.   <br> Identify, other than Government aircraft and test facilities any required Government data, test facilities, and/or property to support the proposed research effort. <br>  <br> 5.6	Security.  <br> Contractors interested in participation in this effort must either have a facility clearance or be able to obtain one.  Dependent upon the nature of the technologies identified to address the signature reduction objectives a DD 254 may be required for support of design and analysis activities, however, shall be required in the event Phase 3 efforts are pursued. Access to or generation of classified data will be limited to Secret. The Joint Multi-Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator Security Classification Guide will be utilized for those design and analysis activities requiring classification oversight. <br>  <br> 5.7	Data Rights <br> The Government desires,  quote mark Unlimited Rights quote mark , but at a minimum requires,  quote mark Government Purpose Rights quote mark  as defined by DFARS Part 227, to all technical data, deliverables, and computer software developed under this program, and no limitations on the use of delivered and/or residual hardware.  It is the Offeror's responsibility to clearly define the proposed data rights for technical data, computer software and each deliverable. Ambiguities will be negatively evaluated against the Offeror. <br>  <br> 5.8	Minimum Required Reporting and Deliverables <br> Any award will require, as a minimum, the following data items or deliverables: (1) Program Management Plan, (2) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (3) Final Report, (4) Final Briefing Charts (5) Design Review Briefing Charts, (6) Test Plans, (7) Test Reports,  (Note:  Each of these items shall be delivered in the Offeror's format).  Any award under this announcement will require a kickoff meeting following award.  All awards will include a requirement to present the results of the work in a final briefing at Ft. Eustis, Virginia upon completion of all technical effort.  <br>  <br> 6.0	Evaluation Criteria <br> The evaluation criteria outlined in BAA, W911W6-15-R-0004, paragraph 6.1 will not be used.  The criteria outlined below will be used for this call to include Step 1 White papers and Step 2 proposals. <br>  <br> The selection of proposals will be based on a peer/scientific review of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to others submitted under this announcement.  The five evaluation criteria below are of equal weight. <br>  <br> Criterion I:  The extent to which affordable, comprehensive, efficient, and innovative technologies are proposed within the technology area to satisfy the program objective and BAA requirements. This will include understanding of the problem, current technical barriers, and how the proposed solution eliminates those barriers. <br>  <br> Criterion II:  The merit of the Offeror's proposed approach to develop and demonstrate the proposed technologies.  This includes the reasonableness of the tasks, schedule, and approach to accomplish the proposed technical objectives. <br>  <br> Criterion III:  The benefit of the proposed technologies and the potential for transition to future and current Army rotary wing aircraft. This includes a clear and reasonable path to implementation of  the technology, and the efficiency (e.g. weight, engine aero/thermodynamic performance as well as potential aircraft system performance attributes) of the proposed technologies. Factors affecting transition of the technologies (e.g. Engine power class limitation, aircraft platform integration factors/limitations, and potential signature reduction / susceptibility reduction capabilities) will be evaluated. <br>  <br> Criterion IV:  The capability of the Offeror to accomplish the proposed effort.  This includes the experience and qualifications of the proposed personnel, the suitability of the proposed facilities, and the availability (or the ability to generate) of required technical and test data to validate the technology.  <br>  <br> Criterion V:  The reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost to the Government.  The proposed cost will be analyzed to determine whether the proposed cost elements (man-hours, labor categories, materials, travel, and other costs) are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the Offeror's technical proposal.  Reasonableness of the proposed costs, in their nature and amount, will be evaluated against what would be prudent in the conduct of competitive business.  The degree to which the offeror is willing to engage in TIA contractual arrangement with the government will be considered. <br> 	 <br> The Government reserves the right to select for award all or part of any proposal received.  Partial awards are conditioned upon the Government and the offeror reaching mutually agreeable terms for such partial awards. <br>  <br> 7.0	Other Information <br>  <br> A draft TIA format is attached with this call.   <br>  <br> 7.1 Information for Proposal Respondents: No deviation from Master BAA W911W6-15-R-0004. <br>  <br> 7.2 Export Control Considerations <br> Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 e t. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C.

Does the estimated contract execution cost of $1,188,400 per contract action include the total contract Gov't cost share for both Phases I and II (i.e. As a TIA is a 50/50 cost share the total value of the TIA for both Phases I and II could be $2,376,800)? <br>  <br> Answer:  Yes, the $1,188,400 is the total Government funding available for the Phase I and II effort across all awarded actions. <br>  <br> Question 5.  It is assumed that the whitepaper referenced in section 5.2.1 of the solicitation call does not include any cost information. Is that a correct assumption? <br>  <br> Answer:  White papers shall include the following: 1. Proposed objectives, concepts, ideas, methodologies. 2. A clear statement of work citing specific tasks to be performed and approach to be taken; 3. Brief description of relevant past experience and capabilities; 4. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate delineating by fiscal year major cost items (e.g., labor, material, subcontracts, etc.) estimated number of labor hours and any proposed fee. 5. Funding Profile - desired funding by fiscal year shall be identified (in the event we incrementally fund). All white papers shall be submitted in 3 paper copies and electronic format on disc (PDF or MS Word). (See Amendment) <br>  <br> Question 6.  Does the  quote mark single topic area quote mark  language in section 5.2.1 refer to type of aircraft? Thought here is that aircraft geometry will shape the solution space for the adaptive IR suppressor. Is it OK to submit a whitepaper for tiltrotors and another one for rotorcraft if they have similar but not identical technology <br> elements? <br>  <br> Answer:  Yes, design considerations lending themselves toward tilt rotor aircraft applications is acceptable. The effort's intent is to investigate suppression technology options for the FVL class of aircraft (which includes as consideration tilt rotor configuration aircraft) as well as the potential extrapolation of design concepts for use in legacy fleet aircraft. It should be noted that a flight <br> demonstration of the developed system may be limited to use of a legacy aircraft as a surrogate demonstration platform however. <br>  <br> Question 7.  Delivery date for proposal is Monday April 6th, 2015.  Is it acceptable to overnight the proposal on April 2nd and have it delivered on the 3rd?  <br>  <br> Answer: Yes, the white paper can be submitted any time prior to the specific date and time in the BAA Call.  See paragraph 5.1 of the Master BAA regarding timely submission of white papers. <br>  <br> Question 8.  Although not requesting at this time, would AATD consider an extension for time of whitepaper delivery by 1 week? <br>  <br> Answer:  An extension of the white paper due date is not anticipated in order to meet the requirements remaining in the 2 Step BAA process to make an award by the 4th quarter FY15. <br>  <br> Question 9.  Whether the marking for the whitepaper is an evaluation criterion for reviewing the whitepaper as it is defined for the execution/development of this contract under section 5.7 of this Call requesting unlimited or gov't purpose rights and states  quote mark Ambiguities will be negatively evaluated against the offerer quote mark . <br>  <br> Answer:  Section 5.7 is for Data Rights Assertions addressing deliverable technical data items.  It will be considered an ambiguity if the data rights are not addressed in the white paper.   <br>  <br> Question 10.  Does the evaluation criteria in section 6 apply to white papers as well as the proposals? <br>  <br>  Answer: Yes, the same criteria will be used for evaluation of white papers and any requested full proposals.  The difference will be in the available details in the offeror's submission (i.e. white paper vs proposal). <br>  <br> Question 11.  Should we use Master BAA paragraph 5.1.1 as guidance for the white paper? Specifically we would like clarification on whether evaluators would like cost information / projections in the white paper, or if cost information would be provided upon request for proposal for phase 2? <br>  <br> Answer: See response to question 5 above. <br>  <br> Question 12.  What is the award date for Phase 1 and Phase 2? The BAA states 4Q FY14, which has already passed. <br>  <br> Answer: The information state in section 5.4 last line  quote mark 4th Quarter of Government FY14 quote mark  is a typographical error.  The correction in the amendment reads  quote mark 4th Quarter of Government FY15 quote mark . <br>  <br> Question 13. . When is the expected release of RFP for Phase 2? <br>  <br>  Answer:  The Phase 1 and 2 will be award from this announcement. Section 5.2.2 Second Step address how proposals will be submitted after the evaluation and selection from the submitted white papers. <br>  <br> Question 14.  Is the expected methodology for delivery hard copy either mail or hand delivery? and Not through AMRDEC SAFE Site? <br> -  <br> Answer:  As indicated in the response to question 5 above white papers will be submitted in 3 paper copies and electronic format on disc (PDF or MS Word). See Amendment and section 5.1 of the BAA Call for additional information on submission of white papers.   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

Add additional text to "Description" in the subsequent announcement.<br /><br />All other solicitation terms and conditions remain unchanged.<br />---<br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT TO ACTION.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support Contracts and Simplified Acquisitions Branch (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate and award a contract for Animal Research Support Services for Intramural Research Program (IRP) researchers.</p>
<p>This acquisition is released on a full and open basis with no set-aside restrictions.</p>
<p>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541712 with a Size Standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-80, March 2, 2015.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 15-contracting by Negotiations at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p>The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the NIA requires animal research support services to support IRP Investigators for on-going biomedical research projects primarily at the Biomedical Research Center (BRC) building on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus, 251 Bayview Blvd, Baltimore, MD.</p>
<p>SITE VISIT:<br />A pre-proposal conference will be held with prospective offerors at the NIA animal care facility, at 251 Bayview Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21224, on Monday, April 6, 2015 from 10:00am to Noon, Eastern time. The pre-proposal conference will be a site visit to the animal care facility held for the purpose of providing information concerning the Government's requirements which may be helpful in the preparation of proposals and for answering any questions which you have regarding this requirement.</p>
<p>The pre-proposal conference will consist of an initial pre-facility meeting taking place promptly at 10:00am that will provide an overview of the acquisition and will be immediately followed by the facility walk-through. Anyone that has been in a different animal facility within 24 hours of the pre-proposal conference will not be allowed into the facility or the facility walk-through. Anyone arriving past the beginning of the pre-facility meeting will not be allowed into the facility. Attendees will not be reimbursed for any cost of attending the site visit. Attendees are reminded to allow extra time to find parking and proceed through security.</p>
<p>Contractors that will attend the site visit must submit their company name, name(s) of attendees, and contact information including email and telephone number, to the contract specialist, Hunter Tjugum, via email at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov or phone at 301-435-8780, no later than COB Wednesday April 1, 2015.</p>
<p>The success of this type of conference depends largely on the lead-time available to the Government for research in connection with questions submitted by offerors. Therefore, you are encouraged to submit questions via email to the Contract Specialist no later than three days prior to the pre-proposal conference (i.e. April 1 at 4:30pm Eastern) as it relates to information concerning the facility walk-through site visit. Offerors should note that their questions may not be answered at the conference. Only generic questions will be answered during the pre-proposal conference and facility walk-through.</p>
<p>Because of space limitations, each prospective offeror shall be limited to a total of 2 representatives at the Pre-Proposal conference, in addition to one (1) small business representative.</p>
<p>Attendance at the pre-proposal conference is recommended; however, attendance is not a prerequisite for proposal submission and will not be considered a factor in proposal evaluation.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />Contractor services will include genotyping services, attending ACUC Veterinarian representation, and cryopreservation services as detailed in the attached work statement draft. Additional services include animal husbandry for rodents, rabbits, guinea pigs, non-human primates and other species; research technical support; breeding novel genetic models; routine maintenance of animal care equipment; logistical and clerical support; and other specialized services required as new animal study proposals (ASP) are introduced by IRP investigators.</p>
<p>ADDED IN AMENDMENT 003: "The Contractor shall ensure that all animal care and use is conducted in accordance with "NIA Requirements" (as defined in the SOW) and report inconsistency or non-compliance to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and Alternate Contracting Officer Representative (ACOR); both of which shall be indicated as "COR" hereafter." END OF ADDED AMENDMENT 003.</p>
<p>The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical (which encompasses experience and past performance factors), and cost/price factors. Specifically, proposals will be evaluated against three technical criteria: Technical Approach, 45%, Corporate Capability, 35%, and Corporate Experience, 20%. Offerors are required to submit an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan with their business proposal. Past Performance will be an evaluatable criterion after determination of a competitive range is established.</p>
<p>Offerors shall refer to the solicitation for submission instructions.</p>
<p>The Comparative Medicine Section (CMS), under the NIA Office of the Scientific Director (OSD), provides oversight for the overall program of laboratory animal housing, care, and management to ensure compliance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) Guide, as interpreted by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), NIH Policy, and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALACi).</p>
<p>The Government anticipates making one award for a cost-reimbursement type of contract for a period of one base year and four optional periods of performance. The base period shall be effective September 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016 with the option to exercise an additional four option year periods of performance subsequently.</p>
<p>This acquisition is a follow on requirement that will be recompeted for the similar requirement awarded under prior contract HHSN271201000009C to Charles River Laboratories, Inc. on March 1, 2010 for a period of five years.</p>
<p>The solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and proposals are due not later than May 8, 2015.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from the Contract Specialist, Hunter Tjugum, electronically at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov. Please reference the solicitation number HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-PSOL-2015-073 on your electronic request.</p>

<CONTACT>Mark Morgan, Concessions Management Specialist, Phone (404) 507-5638, Email Mark_Morgan@nps.gov
<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10 year concession contract to provide for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at the Mammoth Cave Hotel within Mammoth Cave National Park. The Director, pursuant to 36 C.F.R. Part 51, has determined the existing Concessioner is NOT a preferred Offeror for the Contract to be awarded.<br /><br />As an attraction, Mammoth Cave predates all national parks in the United States: historic records report that people first started visiting the cave in 1816, and it became internationally known by the mid-1800s. Congress authorized Mammoth Cave National Park on May 25, 1926. The purpose of Mammoth Cave National Park is to preserve the cave system, including Mammoth Cave, the scenic river valleys of the Green and Nolin rivers, and a section of south central Kentucky for recreational use, particularly the hilly country north of Green River. The Park contains the longest recorded cave system in the world with more than 400 miles explored and mapped. The Park was designated a World Heritage Site on October 27, 1981, and became the core area of an International Biosphere Reserve on September 26, 1990. <br /><br />The Concession Business Opportunity is comprised of Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services: <br />The Concessioner will operate the Mammoth Cave Hotel which includes the Sunset Terrace Lodge, the Historic Cottages, and the Woodland Cottages, a full service dining room and a new fast casual facility, a gift shop located in the Mammoth Cave Hotel offering merchandise and Kentucky-made crafts. Additionally, the Concessioner will operate the Camper Store at the Service Center Complex, which provides grocery, camping supplies, and convenience items. The Concessioner also currently operates eight buses to transport approximately 42 percent of cave tour visitors from the visitor center to various cave entrances. Other required services include vending, kennels, and public shower/laundry services within its facilities. Gross revenues from 2010-2012 have been between $3,814,646 and $3,990,194.
<p>A site visit will be held on February 4, 2015 at Mammoth Cave National Park. Please RSVP at least one week in advance if you plan to attend the site visit by contacting Bruce Powell, Deputy Superintendent at (270) 758-2186 or email bruce_powell@nps.gov. The site visit will be an opportunity for all interested parties to get an overview of the concession operation along with a tour of Concession Facilities associated with the Draft Contract.</p>
<p>Questions related to the Prospectus must be submitted in writing, via email to Bruce Powell, Deputy Superintendent, Mammoth Cave National Park, at bruce_powell@nps.gov, no later than Thursday, February 12, 2015.</p>
<p>All proposals, including that of the existing Concessioner, must be received by the National Park Service, Attn: Mark Morgan, Concessions Management Specialist, Southeast Region, NPS, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA 30303 no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on Wednesday, April 15, 2014, in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract.</p>
<p>The prospectus describes the business opportunity and includes the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract. The prospectus is available on the NPS website at http://www.concessions.nps.gov/Prospectus.cfm, or you can receive a hard copy for $40.00. To request a copy of the prospectus, send a check for $40.00 payable to the National Park Service to Mark Morgan at the address listed above. This amount includes an administrative charge and Fed Ex shipping fee for each prospectus. Please include a physical address (no post office box) and telephone number. You may also pick up a printed copy at the Superintendent's Office at Park Headquarters for $35.00 (checks only). No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored.</p>
<p>If you are planning to submit a proposal and have obtained your prospectus from the website, we recommend that you advise Mark Morgan, at the above address or call (404) 507-5638 or e-mail at Mark_Morgan@nps.gov of your interest so your contact information can be placed on a mailing list to receive future responses to questions or amendments to the prospectus. Those receiving a hard copy or who are on the mailing list will be provided with any additional information specific to the prospectus in writing. The same information will be posted to the above mentioned website. Inquiries can be directed to Mark Morgan at (404) 507-5638 or e-mail at Mark_Morgan@nps.gov.</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: CC-MACA002-16</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MODIFICATION #7</span></strong><br /><br />This modification is to provide further explanation for Modification #6, which extended the solicitation for MACA002-16 an additional 63 days to June 17, 2015. The National Park Service intends to change the term of the contract to 15 years and make other operational improvements to the business opportunity. Once the changes have been finalized, the solicitation may be extended again to provide additional time for offerors to revise their proposals.<br /><br />All offers must now be received by the NPS No Later Than 4:00 p.m. (EDT) on Wednesday June 17, 2015, in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract. The National Park Service will issue an additional modification to reflect significant changes to the original solicitation. An additional site visit will be scheduled prior to the end of the new solicitation period and announced in the additional modification.<br />Points of Contact: Bruce Powell, Deputy Superintendent, Mammoth Cave National Park, bruce_powell@nps.gov, (270) 758-2186 or Mark Morgan, Concessions Management Specialist, Southeast Regional Office, mark_morgan@nps.gov, (404) 507-5638</p>

<p>
<p>Answer: The Dormitory building is 4,832 square feet in size, and a portion of the building houses the laundry. The dormitory section of the building consists of six (6) two-room, one-bath dorm units. The pillow count is estimated to be 12.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>2) Question: SBO Page 6 - Investment Analysis-Deferred Maintenance - What are the circumstances that have allowed the maintenance projects to fall so far behind?<br /><br /></strong>Answer: The projects have fallen behind because the future of the contract has been uncertain for the past six years.<br /><br /><strong>3) Question: SBO Page 6 - Personal Property - Is there any detail on the personal property that is required to be purchased for $364K (item description, number of units, age, condition, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>
<p>Answer: No, this information is not available. This estimate was prepared by a third party Personal Property valuator. Offerors are expected to make their own estimates.</p>
<p><strong>4) Question: SBO Page 10 - Food &amp; Beverage - Are there any agreements with food or beverage suppliers that continue after January 1, 2016?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No, there are no agreements that continue past January 1, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>5) Question: SBO Page 11 - Retail - Is there a requirement that retail operations close during the off peak season?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No, retail operations may continue during the off-peak season.</p>
<p><strong>6) Question: SBO Page 15 - Mammoth Cave National Park Visitation - Is there any market research available that defines visitor demographics?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Service does not provide market research. All Offerors are responsible for conducting their own due diligence and calculating their own estimates and projections for revenues, costs, and all other purposes related to the Draft Contract. Visitor demographics at Mammoth Cave National Park ("Park") were last assessed in a Visitor Study that was conducted in 2006. A copy of this document is available upon request to Bruce Powell via email at bruce_powell@nps.gov.</p>
<p><strong>7) Question: SBO Page 16 - Retail - When does the NPS contract with Eastern National expire?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Eastern National Parks operates under a cooperative agreement involving many national park areas, not a contract. This multi-park cooperative agreement provides that it will continue indefinitely with the consent of both parties.</p>
<p><strong>8) Question: Exhibit B Page B-24 - Is a liquor license required/available for dining room service?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: In 2008, the Kentucky Attorney General rendered an opinion which stated that because of exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction over lands comprising Mammoth Cave National Park, the consumption and sale of alcoholic beverages on Park lands is not regulated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Accordingly, the new concessioner will not be required to obtain a liquor license from the State of Kentucky for Main Lodge dining room alcoholic beverage service. Instead of a state-issued liquor license, the Service authorizes the concessioner to serve alcohol in the Main Lodge Building. As is mentioned on page B-25 of the operating plan, the Concessioner must comply with Kentucky Revised Statutes which, for example, require server training in alcohol regulations (STAR) class.</p>
<p><strong>9) Question: Exhibit D Page D-8 - Are any of the properties on historical registries, which might require special construction procedures during renovation?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, Refer to Page 6 of the Proposal Package. Also, refer to Exhibit D, pages 8-9, for historical status. Finally, refer to Exhibit F, pages F-6 and F-7, Concessioner Project Procedures and Appendix G- Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>10) Question: What impact would an increase in White Nose disease have on the facility? Would the site be required to close for certain parts of the year or entirely if the threat of White Nose disease became epidemic?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The impact of White-nose syndrome (WNS) on the bat population in the park is dynamic as the disease runs its course. Park operations will likewise continue to evolve as management actions are implemented as a result of changing circumstances. Typically, bat die-off occurs during the second or third winter after WNS is discovered in a cave. Since being discovered in the Park in 2013, WNS has resulted in a die-off of as much as 80% of some bat species (per bat counts conducted in early 2015). Present Park management efforts relate to conducting risk assessments related to human-bat encounters, identifying additional prevention and response activities to minimize human-bat encounters, and developing communication and educational materials for employees and visitors. No cave tour closures have been implemented to date, and it is unlikely that cave tours in the Park would be curtailed in the future. Similarly, no cave tour schedule changes have occurred to date, and it is also unlikely that there would be significant cave tour schedule changes in the future. However, the Park reserves the right to take necessary or appropriate management actions in the event the dynamics of WNS, and their effect on Park operations and visitor safety, require such actions. Notwithstanding this, we believe it is unlikely that significant negative impacts to concession operations due to WNS will occur, yet some management actions, for short periods or time, can't be totally ruled out in light of visitor safety concerns.</p>
<p><strong>11) Question: What are the bus schedules for peak season and off season? Or, how frequently do they run during the peak and off peak seasons?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: During peak season, there are 16-18 cave tours offered each day that require bus transportation. During the off-peak season, there are 5-8 cave tours offered each day that require bus transportation.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>12) Question: Will the Concessioner pay or be assessed property tax on the real property?<br /><br /></strong>Answer: Assigned Government-owned real property and improvements will remain in Federal ownership during the term of the Contract. NPS does not assess property tax on assigned Government-owned real property and improvements. Offerors should note, however, that Kentucky Revised Statute 3.070(2) states that "Kentucky reserves . . . the right to tax persons, their franchises and properties, on the land [Mammoth Cave National Park] so acquired." Offerors are reminded that under the Contract, the concessioner will be responsible for compliance with all Applicable Laws. Accordingly, offerors should make their own determinations on whether KRS 3.070(2) will apply as to the concessioner under the Contract. The NPS estimate of the franchise fee is based upon the concessioner paying the appropriate amount of property tax based on historic tax payments.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>13) Question: What is the location of the facility where the lodging laundry is cleaned?</strong></p>
</p>
<p>Answer: The laundry room is located in a portion of the Dormitory building, southeast of the Sunset<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<span><strong>MODIFICATION #4 to Solicitation MACA002-16<br /></strong><br />A Concession Business Opportunity for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at Mammoth Cave National Park.

<DESC>NAS Patuxent River requires adequate and reliable airfield pavements, lighting, signage, and related facilities that meet Navy criteria and design standards.  Runway 14-32 serve a variety of high performance jet aircraft and large transports such as the P-8A (Boeing 737) and E-6 (Boeing 707) based and tested at the airfield. 
 
The runway repairs include rehabilitation of the pavements and overruns to meet current standards and to ensure another 20 to 30 years of runway service. This runways keel is projected to have a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) of 41 in 2019 without repair and will be milled and overlayed in 2016 as required to meet airfield standards. The edge lights will be repaired concurrent with keel and shoulder repairs along with replacement conduit and handholds as required.
The thresholds will receive preventative maintenance and the 14 overrun will be reconstructed as needed after the demolition of the abandoned catapult #159. While the runway is out of service for repair, arresting gear slabs will be reconstructed and runway markings will be re-applied. Grading and drainage surrounding the 14-32 runway will also be repaired to correct safety concerns such as sinkholes, drainage issues, and significant erosion adjacent to the runway.  
 
This project will include repairs to the TC-7 catapult access apron as well as repairs to the Runway 20 overrun. These facilities are located within the primary surface of 14-32 and repairs will be made concurrent with runway repairs so as to limit closures and airfield down-time.
  
 
This project will be executed while maintaining operations of the adjacent existing airfield.

CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS  N00189-15-R-0016


QUESTION:   Personnel Qualifications. The Technical response requires a staffing plan  there are NO qualifications or experience standards provided, what will be the basis for being technically acceptable for staffing? The Evaluation Criteria (pp. 20-21) states that we will be evaluated on the vendors capability to identify the personnel who will be staffed for all functions to be assigned to fulfill the PWS to accomplish the effort. Can the government provide the expected qualifications and experience standards required to be technically acceptable? 
ANSWER:   See Attachment I.

QUESTION:  Pricing/Personnel.
 For an LPTA solicitation, typically there are clearly defined levels of effort so that all offerors responses can be compared based on the same criteria and level of effort. There are no position descriptions or levels of effort (hours etc) identified for pricing the tasks to make a realistic comparison of responses. As LPTA solicitations are based on clearly defined levels of effort for non-complex commercial services, can the government clarify the positions requested, the qualifications, and the expected level of effort? Does the procurement of complex Antiterrorism Exercises and program analysis truly fall under non-complex services?
ANSWER:  The procurement of complex Antiterrorism Exercises and program analysis truly falls under non-complex services.
	See Attachments I and II.

QUESTION:  Pricing.
 ORDERING for Task Orders states in f. (page 63) that All labor categories and rates used to price task orders shall be in accordance with Attachment II of the contract. Attachment II is a QASP. Can the government provide the labor categories for adequate pricing comparison?
ANSWER:  See Attachment I and II to this amendment.

QUESTION:   Place of Performance. The source sought identified that three (3) persons would work onsite at USFF. Can you provide clarification of the Place of Performance and on site vs off site requirements?
ANSWER:  Three personnel will be working on site.  One person each, for the Nuclear Weapons Support, Non-Lethal Weapons, and Defense Critical Infrastructure Program tasks.
  The remaining personnel will work off site at a place supplied by the contractor.  A terminal will be provided on-site for any work requiring Secret level access to the computer network.

QUESTION:   Evaluation Criteria. If having or providing no past performance is considered acceptable in the LPTA evaluation, what utility does past performance provide (page 22)?
ANSWER:  Past performance evaluation is required per FAR 15.304.  Having no past performance is not considered acceptable.  Per FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), offerors without a record of past performance or past performance information is unavailable may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. 

QUESTION:  QASP.
 The QASP (Attachment II) states that acceptable performance for documents is: Documentation reviewed and presented to meet acceptance. 95% require no more than two review cycles to finalize. In the development of briefs, IPRS and new documents, the typical review cycle at USFF for planner, O-6/GS-15 and Flag-level review routinely will exceed two cycles  can you clarify this QASP metric? 
ANSWER:  Two review cycles are interpreted as two submissions of a product for review.  To meet the 95%, a product must be in a finalized state within two submissions.  Products must meet a high standard to be acceptable for O-6/GS-15 and Flag-level review.

QUESTION:  Task Orders. As the contract will be task order driven, are each of the provided task areas considered complete task orders? Many have been in work for several years, can the government provide a summary of the status of ongoing task orders so that non-incumbent contractors can accurately gage the level of effort to continue support without duplication of effort? As an example, the Hostile Intent and Small Arms Task Orders have been ongoing for 2-3 years  (REF from 2012 RFP TOs):
ANSWER:  The Small Arms and Hostile Intent Determination tasks are currently executing a Limited Objective Experiment (LOE) to determine proficiency levels of sailors in a simulator environment as it relates to small arms and hostile intent determination training.
  Based upon the findings of the current LOE the contractor will be asked to update the associated instructions/programs and complete the tasks detailed in the PWS.  Reference paragraphs 4.1.1, 4.1.6.3, 4.1.6.5, and 4.1.6.11. 

QUESTION:  Can you tell me if there is an incumbent contractor currently performing work for this requirement? If so, could you please provide their company name and contract number?
ANSWER:  There is an incumbent contractor.  Contract Number:  N00189-12-D-0040

QUESTION:  Pricing. The EVALUATION CRITERIA states that this will be awarded based on LPTA (page 19), however in several places the solicitation states The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced vendor (page 63) Additionally, in the PRICE section, states the price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness.(page A  Can you confirm the acquisition strategy? Is the intent to make the selection based on LPTA for a four star staff support?
ANSWER:  The source selection process will be LPTA.
  

QUESTION: The solicitation states that PDF files are not acceptable for the price quote. Are PDF files acceptable for the Technical and Past Performance Volumes?
ANSWER:  Yes.

QUESTION:   Does a cover page and table of contents count against the 30-page limit for Technical Volume and 6-page limit for Past Performance Volume?
ANSWER:  No.

QUESTION:   On page 66 of the RFP, in note (5) to Volume III Price Proposal within the Instructions to the Vendor, it is stated that the basis of the award will be the total overall price for the Base Period and all two option periods. Is the word two actually meant to be four?
ANSWER:  The word two was meant to be four.   The solicitation has been revised.

QUESTION:   On page 66 of the RFP the Vendor is directed to include a completed RFP Section Schedule of Supplies/Services. Does this refer to the section of the RFP that begins on page 1 under the phrase Contract Line Items as follows: and ends on page 18?
ANSWER:  Yes.

QUESTION:   The Past Performance Information Form (Attachment V) does not completely align with what the government is requesting, i.e.
 missing a block for contract type, and missing separate blocks for Contracting Officer and COR contact information. Can the vendor adjust the form to meet these requirements listed in the Solicitation ADDENDUM INSTRUCTIONS TO THE VENDOR?
ANSWER:  Yes.

A subcontracting plan is separate from the Small Business Participation plan and must meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252.219-7003 (or DFARS 252.219-7004 if the offeror has a comprehensive subcontracting plan).

By providing subcontracting opportunities to small business, the large businesses both formally and informally mentor these businesses by helping them gain experience and increase their ability to perform at a higher level.  This in turn helps the small business grow as a company and independently compete for larger projects as prime contractors or upper tier subcontractors.    <br>    (g) Geographic Proximity to SWD.

<DESC>The following question was received and answer is being provided.
<p>Q: When you say 99% of the work will be done at MacDill does that mean that the software integration and version upgrade development needs to be there or can that be done remotely from the contractor's facility not located in Tampa?</p>
<p>A: <br />1. Initial integration via contractor facility using a VPN capability into the unclassified test bed in St Petersburg. Travel not required.<br />2. Upon completion of step 1; the contractor will transition the code to&nbsp;continue integration on the operational network at MacDill AFB in a secure lab. This is where 99% of the final integration and testing will be conducted. This is why we requested 2 SCI cleared personnel.<br />3. Once approved for the operational network the code will need to be moved to the secondary location. Most likely Ft. Bragg, NC.</p>

<p>Q1: In Attachment 7 - Requirements Cross Reference Matrix document, in reference to Req# K4 - In reference to the statement "The ASAE software tool shall integrate...utilizing appropriate APIs" - Can the contractor assume DCGS-SOF is or will use ML Version 7.03as this version supports SPARQL interfaces? If not, please specify which version the contractor should use.</p>
<p>A1: DCGS-SOF is using MarkLogic version 7-0.4-3 with SPARQL.</p>
<p>Q2: In Attachment 7 - Requirements Cross Reference Matrix document, in reference to Req# 1.11 - Can the Govt. provide the OWL files behind the Ontology documentation?</p>
<p>A2: DCGS-SOF uses NetOwl for entity extraction and NetOwl does not use OWL files. OWL files are used to describe the Ontology in a markup language (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language).</p>

<DESC>The following questions were received and answers are being provided.
<p>Q1: Can an offeror install additional infrastructure components and/or reference additional Virtual Machines in the virtual sandbox?</p>
<p>A1: Potential offerors are directed to KPP K4, which states in part &lsquo;All data (accessed, modified, derived, manipulated, etc.) shall remain stored in the SOF data layer only.' The Government understands that some minor additions to the API could be made in order for the proposed ASAE software tool to function correctly. If an offeror chooses to add something, then that will be evaluated. If an offeror chooses to propose a capability based on their business model and if it does not meet any KPP or too many other requirements in the FRD as described in the solicitation attachments, they will receive a score accordingly.</p>
<p>Q2: Will the Ad Hoc training support (Train a third party maintainer...) take place at more than one location or at a single location? If it is more than one location, are they in more than one geographical location? Will the training of the new equipment vendor (computer-based training) be concurrent with the third-party maintainer's training or will it require a separate trip?</p>
<p>A2: The ad hoc training support will take place at a single location, MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida. The training of the new equipment vendor and the training of the third-party maintainer will be two separate training events as the trainings are different and the new equipment vendor and third-party maintainer are two different companies. The number of trips taken to complete the two trainings is up to each offeror.</p>
<p>Q3: As part of the integration into the DCGS-SOF environment the contractor is required to comply with all DISA STIG and SOF Group Policy requirements and it appears that the software will be installed on more than one network, will both networks be using the same set of STIGs? Can an offeror assume that once the software goes through the DCGS-SOF Development Test Environment and the Staging Environment it can get installed on any other DCGS-SOF networks?</p>
<p>A3: Yes, the same set of STIGs are used for each network. Yes, once the software goes through the DCGS-SOF Development Test Environment and the Staging Environment, it can get installed on any other network.</p>
<p>Q4: For pricing purposes, does each of the networks have its own test and staging environment or is that a one-time process and then just install the software on the other networks?</p>
<p>A4: The test and staging process will occur once and then the software can be installed on the other networks.</p>

<DESC>The following questions were received and answers are being provided.
<p>Q1: Has the government considered funding the demo phases for the selected vendors?</p>
<p>A1: The Government considered this option but elected not to fund the demo phases.</p>
<p>Q2: Will the government supply the DCGS-SOF Data Layer Design Document and the DCGS-SOF UI API?</p>
<p>A2: DCGS-SOF Data Layer consists of MarkLogic (Index and database), NetOwl (Entity Extraction), and MetaCarta (Geo-location). DCGS-SOF UI API is available upon request per the directions posted on FBO.</p>
<p>Q3: The phrase "will" is not allowed in the response - can an offeror state its roadmap for future capabilities that are natural expansions of the delivered capabilities?</p>
<p>A3: The offeror is expected to have a solution to integrate. If the offeror wants to propose future expansions/enhancements, that is acceptable.</p>
<p>Q4: What are the parameters of the demonstration environment (machine power, processing, storage, memory, etc...)?</p>
<p>A4: The Government will provide a separate commercially-hosted, virtual cloud environment for each vendor. During the demonstration phase if it is deemed necessary to increase any of the parameters of the cloud instance, it is strongly recommended that the offeror immediately notify the Government of the requested change(s).</p>
<p>Q5: The previous Q&amp;A stated that geospatial requirements would be deleted from the final RFP -- the demonstration plan still has geospatial requirements.</p>
<p>A5: See revised Attachment 2, FRD and Attachment 3, Demonstration Plan posted in Amendment 0002: revised Req. # 3.16 and removed section 3.g. (renumbered subsequent sections accordingly) and sample scenario to delete inadvertent geospatial requirement artifacts.</p>
<p>Q6: Can you provide the context (Provide support for various Replication Topologies such as, but not limited to; hub-spoke &amp; peer-peer)?</p>
<p>A6: The backend architecture automatically provides for data replication to various locations. The ASAE solution must have the ability to store/save analytical view and associated data in the database to allow for replication and retrieval by other users.</p>
<p>Q7: Can you define what is meant by - "Provide behavioral analysis capability" and what is the expectation as it relates to the demonstration scenario?</p>
<p>A7: The observable relationship of behavior to the environment. In the Demonstration Plan, a sample scenario was provided. During the Usability Demonstration, analysts will be provided a different scenario to determine if they can identify insurgent activity using the proposed ASAE software tool.</p>
<p>Q8: Please define - "Provide Multi-iterative analysis capability".</p>
<p>A8: A general class of iterative methods introduced for solving positive definite linear systems. These methods use two or more different iterative techniques and each of them reduces the error by a constant factor in a different subspace.</p>
<p>Q9: Please define - "Provide persistent and metadata searches".</p>
<p>A9: Persistent search is a method of searching where the query is given first and the information for the results is then acquired vice acquiring the results and then executing the query. Metadata search is the ability to discover relevant information based on the metadata of a document.</p>
<p>Q10: Please elaborate on the meaning of "Provide pattern matching and analysis capability".</p>
<p>A10: See revised Attachment 2, FRD posted in Amendment 0002: corrected Req. # 3.5 to read "Provide pattern recognition and analysis capability", which is defined as the ability to recognize patterns and regularities in the data and the analysis of the data.</p>
<p>Q11: Who is responsible for the "metadata tagging of products created"? Isn't the SDL already doing this?</p>
<p>A11: When an analyst creates a product, in this case from the ASAE solution, there are metadata fields that only the analyst will know the answer to. The analyst should be prompted to enter the information when saving. This metadata should be saved with the product.</p>
<p>Q12: Does the Government expect the DCGS-SOF ASAE Software Tool to meet every requirement listed in the FRD once the integration is completed and ready to go into production?</p>
<p>A12: As outlined in the RFP, the Government requires all of the KPP's, all of the requirements in the Advanced Analytics category, and at least 90 of the remaining 100 requirements in the FRD to be met initially. The Government is acceptable to receiving a Plan of Action &amp; Milestone for the requirements that aren't met initially. This can be discussed at the contract kickoff meeting.</p>
<p>Q13: It is possible to have a concept of operations that allows for the sharing of repositories without any loss of security, data pedigree, etc. The KPP 4 language is restrictive. Will the Government consider a re-wording like "local copies of information can be maintained for performance, but master data will remain in the SOF Data Layer"?</p>
<p>A13: No. The ASAE solution is expected to be integrated into the existing architecture and User Interface, not spawn off into its own environment. The User Interface physically resides on the SDL database server so there are no performance issues. The Government does not wish nor anticipate having additional databases or data stores to meet this KPP. The vendor has full access to the underlying database.</p>
<p>Q14: Will the Government consider flexibility on KPP 6?</p>
<p>A14: No. The disconnected technology that DCGS-SOF uses has been proven for a couple of years in several exercises around the world on multiple networks.</p>
<p>Q15: Can the offeror assume that in any given year that the Government will only purchase either CLIN 0002 &amp; 0003 or CLIN 0004 &amp; 0005? So, at most the Government will purchase CLIN 0001, one Enterprise-wide license, and four renewal Enterprise-wide licenses, is this correct?</p>
<p>A15: Offerors can assume that in year 1, only CLIN 0001 (initial integration) and CLIN 0002 or CLIN 0003 (enterprise-wide license or disconnected server license) would be ordered. In years 2 through 5, any combination of CLINs 0002 - 0005 could be ordered depending on when the ASAE software is required for the first time at new locations or disconnected servers and when the initial licenses purchased under CLINs 0002 or 0003 come up for renewal.</p>
<p>Q16: When filling out either CLIN 0002 or 0004 on the Total Evaluated Price Worksheet, can the offeror assume that the Government has already purchased one network license and the values for 2-5 networks and 5+ networks is the difference between a single network cost and the additional cost required to support additional networks?</p>
<p>Or, will the Government simply take the number in the 2-5 networks/5+networks and multiply it by the number of networks that the Government desires to purchase as described in Attachment 9 (Section M) paragraph M.2.3.1?</p>
<p>A16: See Revised Attachment 8, Total Evaluated Price Worksheet posted in Amendment 0002. The Government will evaluate the unit prices provided for CLINs 0002 and 0004 and will take the unit prices provided for CLINs 0003 and 0005 and multiply them by the pre-selected quantity of licenses for evaluation purposes. Upon contract award and depending on networks required, a delivery order against CLIN 0002 would be made for quantity 1 at the 2, 3, or 4 network unit price. If 8 networks were required, the delivery order against CLIN 0002 would be made for quantity 2 at the 4 network unit price, etc. Depending on disconnected licenses required, a delivery order against CLIN 0003 would be made for the required quantity. *NOTE* The ASAE ad hoc training will already be covered under CLIN 0002 so it is not required under CLIN 0003. When it comes time to renew the licenses ordered under CLIN 0002 or CLIN 0003, a delivery order(s) against CLINs 0004 and 0005 would be made at the appropriate quantities. Again, the ASAE ad hoc training will already be covered under CLIN 0004 so it is not required under CLIN 0005.</p>

<DESC>The following questions were received and answers are being provided.
<p>Q1: Will CLIN 0003 be purchased without purchasing CLIN 0002?</p>
<p>A1: If a contract is awarded, the Government intends to issue a delivery order against CLIN 0002 in the first year.</p>
<p>Q2: In section 6.2 of the SOW it mentions SIPR net and SIPR net is a production network. The SOW in section 3.2 ask for 2 enterprise-wide licenses for test and integration. Can the offeror assume that the licenses provided will not get installed on a production network?</p>
<p>A2: Correct. The licenses will be installed on development networks.</p>
<p>Q3: Can you please clarify the definition of unit price as it applies to CLINs 0003 and 0005? More specifically, if the unit cost provided is $1,000 does that mean the Government will get up to 50 licenses for $1,000 or that the Government will pay $50,000 for 50 licenses?</p>
<p>A3: The Government will pay the unit price x quantity for CLINs 0003 and 0005. If the unit price is $1,000.00 and the quantity required is 50, a delivery order would be issued for $50,000.00.</p>
<p>Q4a: Is NetOwl available for use by ASAE respondents? If so, which version and which of the following products:</p>
<p>Text Analytics:<br />NetOwl Extractor<br />NetOwl DocMatcher<br />NetOwl TextMiner</p>
<p>Entity Analytics:<br />NetOwl NameMatcher<br />NetOwl EntityMatcher</p>
<p>A4a: NetOwl is used on the backend for Text and Entity Analytics. The data presented to the ASAE solution will be pre-tagged by NetOwl and stored in XML.</p>
<p>Q4b: Are licenses needed?</p>
<p>A4b: No.</p>
<p>Q4c: Has enrichment already been done to the content?</p>
<p>A4c: Yes.</p>
<p>Q4d: Is there a desire by the customer to have a different or additional extraction and entity resolution capability?</p>
<p>A4d: No.</p>
<p>Q5: Once the Government purchases the first enterprise-wide license, for the first location, it includes software assurance, ad hoc training, ad hoc integration, and version updates/patch sets. For costing purposes, does the Government expect the offeror to include those costs in the licenses for the additional locations in years 2 &amp; 3?</p>
<p>If not, how could the offerors cost out years 2 and 3 if they are not certain whether or not the Government will purchase CLIN 2 in the first year.</p>
<p>A5: If a contract is awarded, the Government intends to issue a delivery order against CLIN 0002 in the first year.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael J. Hawkins, Contracting Officer, Phone 8138267047, Email michael.hawkins4@socom.mil
<DESC>The following questions were received and answers are being provided.
<p>Q1: Is there a missing row for &lsquo;Unit price for 1 disconnected license' under CLINs 0003 and 0005 or is the offeror to assume that the Government is not interested in quantity one purchases and will initially purchase two (2) licenses?</p>
<p>A1: Correct. The Government is not interested in quantity one purchases of disconnected licenses and will initially purchase a minimum of two disconnected licenses under CLIN 0003 if/when the requirement for a disconnected license arises. *NOTE* One disconnected license will be provided under CLIN 0001 per the revised CLIN description.</p>
<p>Q2: Using the current matrix, how does the offeror provide a price break for more than 4 networks?</p>
<p>A2: The Total Evaluated Price Worksheet is setup to reflect anticipated Government requirements. Offerors shall submit pricing on the worksheet per paragraph L.2.3.1 of Attachment 6, ASAE 52.212-1 Addendum.</p>
<p>Q3: Using the current matrix, how does the offeror provide a price break for additional locations?</p>
<p>A3: The Total Evaluated Price Worksheet is setup to reflect anticipated Government requirements. Offerors shall submit pricing on the worksheet per paragraph L.2.3.1 of Attachment 6, ASAE 52.212-1 Addendum.</p>
<p>Q4: How can an offeror be compliant in terms of properly completing the matrix while simultaneously offering the most cost effective solution to the Government?</p>
<p>A4: The Government has determined that per location, per network pricing meets the requirement. Alternate pricing arrangements will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Q5: Will an all-electronic submission for this RFP be accepted?</p>
<p>A5: Per L.1.10, hard copies of each volume will be required so an all-electronic submission will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Q6: Reference Attachment 6, ASAE_52.212-1_Addendum (Section L), L.1.10 Proposal Submission Requirements, Table 1. Volume Requirements and L.2.1 Volume 1 - Factor 1 - Technical: Table 1 indicates that the 20 page limit of Volume 1 does not include the Cross Reference Matrix (CRM) or any reference documentation. L.2.1 includes instructions for two written components: Subfactor 1, the Requirements CRM and Reference documentation, and Subfactor 4, the Implementation Plan. Is it the Government's intent that the Implementation Plan be submitted in this 20 pages, or will the Implementation Plan be requested only after an offeror successfully completes Subfactors 2 and 3 Demonstrations?</p>
<p>A6: A complete proposal to include an Implementation Plan is due at proposal submission.</p>
<p>Q7: Does the Government have a preference for receiving software pricing as a perpetual license or a subscription license?</p>
<p>A7: Preference is perpetual.</p>
<p>Q8: Will the Government allow modification of the Pricing template and Attachment 8 to allow the offeror to present both pricing alternatives for the Government to consider and evaluate? Should the offeror submit 2 versions of attachment 8 clearly labeled as alternate options?</p>
<p>A8: Offerors shall submit pricing on the worksheet per paragraph L.2.3.1 of Attachment 6, ASAE 52.212-1 Addendum. Alternate pricing arrangements will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Q9: If the offeror's ASAE tool is comprised of multiple software modules, how does the Government require the breakdown of those individual module costs be shown in Attachment 8 and the SF-1449? May the offeror add more rows as needed in Attachment 8 to show the breakdown of individual software components for each unit price, or does the Government prefer a separate Bill of Materials with individual software modules be provided?</p>
<p>A9: No breakdown is required. The Government expects one cost for the solution per the Total Evaluated Price Worksheet.</p>
<p>Q10: May the offeror provide an additional descriptive information tab to Attachment 8 to provide clarifying information, such as demonstrating any discount from software list price, or assumptions, which would normally appear in a cost volume narrative?</p>
<p>A10: Yes.</p>
<p>Q11: Reference Attachment 3, Demonstration Plan, criteria for the Usability Demonstration 2: Phase 2 criteria for 2.a, 2.c, 2.e, 2.g, and 2.i seem to have a positive connotation to a high score of 5 or "strongly agree". In the same section, the criteria for 2.b, 2.d, 2.f, 2.h, and 2.j have a negative connotation to the same scoring of 5 or "strongly agree". Can the government please clarify how scores across each of the 10 questions will be aggregated such that a rating of "Strongly Disagree" or "Strongly Agree" will consistently imply either a positive or a negative rating from users?</p>
<p>A11: The scale of 1-5 does not directly correlate to Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree for all questions. For the positively worded questions, it does. For the negatively worded questions, the scale is flipped so that 5 correlates to Strongly Disagree and 1 correlates to Strongly Agree.</p>
<p>Q12: Please specify the due dates for each CDRL A001-A007 relative to the contract award date, or meeting date as applicable? What is the timing for CDRL updates required upon exercise of CLINs 0004 and 0005?</p>
<p>A12: See block 16 on each page of Exhibit A - ASAE CDRLs.</p>
<p>Q13: "Requirement 5.1 in the CRM attachment specifies &lsquo;tracking intelligence history across enterprise nodes'. Could the Government specify which enterprise nodes are required to be tracked against, and what elements of historical information are required to be tracked?"</p>
<p>A13: The Government is not tracking the nodes but is tracking user history from their analysis. For example, an analyst begins work and they move to another location or the system goes down and they come back online connected to a different node; the analyst's work and workspace should be persisted so they do not have to start over. Another example, an analyst creates something and a month later there is a question and the analyst needs to go back and determine how he/she arrived at that conclusion. He/she will need the user history.</p>

This answer appears to conflict with Key Performance Parameter K2 "Entity Resolution". Is it a requirement for offerors to provide Entity Resolution capability as described in KPP K2 of the FRD, or are offerors allowed to leverage the existing services identified below to meet this FRD requirement as the answers to this series of questions imply.</p>
<p>A14: Yes the offeror&lrm; can leverage existing technology to meet the entity resolution requirement.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2). <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC)-New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000 awarded Contract W15QKN-15-D-0019 to Raytheon Company, 1151 E. Hermans Road, Tucson, Arizona 85756-9367.  Contract W15QKN-15-D-0019 is to procure engineering services for the Excalibur program.

The Smart Energy and Audio Solution (IMPRES) extends the battery life and improves voice intelligibility. Motorola is the sole owner/creator of this IMPRES solution.

This allows for the purchase radio batteries less often and saves money. <br> The IMPRES batteries are specifically manufactured for the APX 6000 handheld radio and have a fuel gauge icon (indicator) that is displayed only when the battery voltage drops to low level and the battery needs replacement. Also, the IMPRES battery displays the remaining power of the battery in Mah and the number charges cycles the battery has gone thorough. <br> 5.

<DESC>Motorola radios were purchased with IMPRES batteries and charging station solution at the Anniston Army Depot.  Motorola is the sole owner/creator of this IMPRES solution.  The IMPRES batteries are specifically manufactured for the APX 6000 handheld radio and have a fuel gauge icon (indicator) displays when the battery voltage drops to low levels and needs replacement. The batteries may be safely left on the charger without damage and will maintain a full charge.  Replacement requirements for new batteries are reduced and so are the cost.

                  0  Mod to Existing Order Number 	Insert task/delivery order no.  		

Order against:  1   FSS Contract Number: __V797P-2050D_________________

Name of Proposed Contractor:	Quotient BioDiagnostics Inc
Street Address:	301 S. State St Ste S-204
City, State, Zip:	Newtown, PA 18940
Phone:	     



2.	Description of Supplies or Services:

The estimated value of the proposed action is $ 29,508.00

Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 16, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS),  John L. McClellan Memorial Veterans Hospital, 4300 W. 7th St, Little Rock, AR  72205-5484, has an emergency requirement #598-15-2-110-0092.
This is procurement will provide reagents and supplies.  Quotient Biodiagnostics is the current
Drop shipment supplier of our 3% reagent red cells used in manual tube testing for blood     typing and crossmatching.  Their products have been tested & validated in our procedures to meet AABB, CAP and FDA regulatory agencies.  Without a continued drop shipment supply, we will not be able to perform blood testing on our patients and subsequently expedite the transfusion of blood products.  Procurement of these  reagents and supplies is needed to  support the testing of samples and for proper diagnosis of patients.

This requirement is conducted on an emergency basis, as no continuous order is placed for the facility, and there is a need for the next shipment to begin immediately, so that no delays will occur that would negatively impact patient care.
Drop shipments will occur for blood bank reagent supplies will be for the performance period of April 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015.  These items are all on FSS contract.  These items are particular this one manufacture and must also be only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The primary purpose of this sole source justification is for an emergency need, but will also identify the one sole source is required. 
The emergency contract is for one contract, and options are not included.  The items are listed below:
 
 

	





3.	Authority: 

ORDER AGAINST FSS:  Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6.  Mark the applicable exception:

1  An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays(FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A);

0  Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B)) or

0  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order and the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures. (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C)

4.	Rational/explanation to support cited authority: 
If the (CAVHS), McClellan Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Little Rock, AR does not receive the new contract for drop shipment of the reagents supplies in a timely and uninterrupted manner, the Blood Bank within the facility willnot be able to provide blood products to the veteran patients and the facility would be at risk of the FDA closing the Blood Bank at this VA location.  Reagent supplies contract is needed as an emergency, in order for shipment to begin, and delivery to be on time.
This contract is also conducted for the supplies from the one responsible source, as the reagents and supplies for the equipment are specific.
Quotient is also the supplier of various specialty antisera used in antigen typing procedures which are FDA licensed.  As an FDA registered facility, CAVHS is required by CFR21 to use FDA licensed antisera.  Availability of antisera may be limited to market demand, human donor sources and manufacturing constraints.  Currantly three vendors on FSS contract that carry most of the major blood bank reagents, however this vendor is the sole source for the rare monoclonal reagents in order to meet the needs of our veterans.

5.	BRAND NAME ONLY:  This buy is estimated to exceed $25,000 and this documentation will be posted along with the RFQ on e-Buy, as required by FAR 8.405-6(b)(3).

This requirement is needed on an emergency basis.

6.	Note that this determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.  The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.

With this extension, the ordering period will end on 23 November 2016.  The ceiling increase and performance extension will allow for the issuance of new TOs to bridge the gap between the current contract requirements and follow-on requirements, sustain SETA support services through any potential Government Accountability Office (GAO) or Small Business Administration (SBA) protest period, and allow for an orderly and smooth transition of work from the incumbent contractor to the successor contractor, without a break in services.  No requirements changes to increase the scope of allowable services are planned.

VISN 5
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  

Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 5, 849 International Dr., Ste. 450, Linthicum, MD 21090 

Requisition No. Funded/Paid thru 1358 Obligation

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 
 
Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the VA has a requirement which can only be reasonably met by a single supplier.  This action is to establish a new Basic Ordering Agreement with the current contractor Agape Health Group, Inc. (H/AHA) services.  Services at this time may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract, when it is likely that an award to another source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The Washington Veterans Affairs Medical Center (DC VAMC) anticipates entering into a sole source acquisition negotiation for eligible Veterans to "continue" receiving H/HHA services.

Home Care Partners is currently supporting DC VAMC by providing services which would otherwise require nursing home placement. H/HHA services to be furnished to Veterans in the community for whom such care is specifically authorized by the DC VAMC.  Provided services include:  physician services, nursing, social work services, assistance with activities of daily living, activity therapy, case management, nutrition services including meals, and transportation.

The Government anticipates awarding a Basic Ordering Agreement in accordance with FAR 16.703.  A binding contract will be formed according to the terms and conditions of this BOA; when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agrees non-VA care is required and the contractor agrees to accept patient and provide direct care services.  Upon acceptance buy the contractor of beneficiaries of VA, all clauses, terms and condition of the BOA shall apply and become part of the resultant contract during such time as the VA patient remains in the contractor care at the expense of the VA. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 

A sole source award will be made to Home Care Partners for continuous services to veterans and eligible beneficiaries.  Home Care Partners, hereafter referred to as "H/HHA" will provide care to include: physician services, nursing, social work services, assistance with activities of daily living, case management, nutrition services including meals and transportation.  Striving to meet healthcare needs and promote maximum wellbeing, a break in continuity of care to our Veterans would prove detrimental and negatively impact the quality of life for this aged Veteran population who require critical assisted services and supportive environment.

The Basic Ordering Agreement cost is as follows:
(5)-Five Year Cost Estimate:  $502,705.61

Period of Performance	Annual Inflation Increase	Increase Amount	Annual Estimate
Base Period	N/A	N/A	$98,000
Option Period 1	1.28%	$1,254.40	$99,254.40
Option Period 2	1.28%	$1,270.46	$100,524.86
Option Period 3	1.28%	$1,286.72	$101,811.77
Option Period 4	1.28%	$1,303.19	$103,114.77
Grand Est. 5 Yrs.	N/A	N/A	$502,705.61


								      
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(d) (1) (A): Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.	

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

As noted in paragraph 3, H/HHA services are essential to the provision of planned programming designed to promote social and health related services to aging Veterans in the service area who are no longer able to manage independently or who are isolated without an essential support network to facilitate needed care services.  A break in the continuity of care to our Veterans would prove detrimental and negatively impact the well-being of the aged Veteran population who require assisted services and supportive environment.  Re-competing the services would result in a change in services to the existing Veterans who already are enrolled and receiving service based on medical necessity for years.  

Veterans with long term psychiatric conditions or organic brain dysfunctions would likely experience a decline in functioning or experience an exacerbation in their level of functioning mentally, emotionally, and physically resulting from a disruption or change in vendor.  A decrease in stability could potentially lead to irreversible harm or even death. (Note: stability with respect to such medical treatment as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of an individual from a vendor).  Consistency in their therapeutic milieu is warranted.  The primary goal is to maintain or restore the Veteran to the highest attainable level of health and well-being, thus Veteran treatment should be focused on stabilizing symptoms as much as possible.  The benefit of a supportive environment would serve both veterans and their caregivers.

Discontinuation of the current contract services will cause an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirement for Veteran support and cause substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

The facility has to meet all state licensing requirements including the state requirement pertaining to level of medical liability insurance.
  
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
	
	A notice of Intent to sole source will be published on FedBizOpps.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

In order to determine whether the contractor's proposed price is fair and reasonable, the Contract Specialist will review the proposed rates against VHA Benchmark rates.  If the contractor's proposed price appears to be questionable for reasonableness, a justification from the contractor will be required in order to determine whether the proposed price is fair and reasonable before award.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Research was conducted on a limited basis due to the limitation of the geographic area.    Research was conducted to establish H/HHA contract services located throughout the local VA's catchment area to provide homemaker services to Veterans near or as near as possible to family or friends.  Market research for future agreements is dependent on the needs of the patient population in the catchment area and resources of the VA Medical Center.  The objective is to maximize patient care while maintaining compliance with VA regulations.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

Continuing service is critical to Veterans to sustain a quality of life at an acceptable level.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

Not applicable for this requirement.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  				
The Contracting Office has identified a method to improve and increase competition for the medical services in areas where completion can be considered.  Approval not to compete does require VA Director and Chief of Staff approval prior to acquiring the medical services.  The procurement action will post to the Government Point of Entry.  Any responses will be referred the GEC coordinator to determine if additional sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist.
