<DESC>Description<br><br>	The Unites States Army's Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), on behalf of the Product Manager (PM) Air Warrior, is pursuing a novel solution to provide pass-through capability to garment barrier fabrics.  This Liquid Pass Through (LPT) device concept allows liquid coolant to be pumped from a liquid-circulating microclimate cooling system, through protective clothing layers worn by the Soldier, and into a tube-lined cooling vest worn against the body.  The LPT must integrate with the protective clothing layers being developed under PM-Air Warrior's Air Soldier program; which are similar to bi-laminate, tri-laminate, and/or coated suits commonly found in commercial dry suits and barrier fabrics.<br>  <br>	Air Soldier is the next generation aircrew mission ensemble that will replace the legacy Air Warrior system used by Army rotary and select fixed wing aircrew members. Air Soldier encompasses all clothing and individual equipment worn or carried by the pilot, including ancillary aircraft mounted hardware and components, that serve the primary objectives of physiological sustainment, personal protection and enhanced mission performance while operating in all environmental and threat conditions, including crash and post-crash escape and evasion scenarios.<br><br>	As previously stated, the purpose of the LPT is to allow chilled coolant to flow in a closed loop from a microclimate cooling system (located outside the barrier layer), to a cooling vest worn against the skin (inside the barrier layer), without compromising the protection capabilities of the barrier fabric layer.  To accommodate this closed loop coolant fluid passage, the LPT must allow for two separately sealed flow paths while integrated with the barrier fabric layer; yielding no leaks inward or outward.  <br><br>The primary LPT interface will be dry suit type ensembles; but will also be considered as an interface with chemical/biological protective garments, such as the Joint Protective Aircrew Chemical Ensemble (JPACE).  This requirement challenges the LPT to accommodate varying fabric thicknesses, as well as sealing against water immersion for dry suit applications and chemical/biological threats for CB applications.  <br><br>	Through this Market Survey, companies are encouraged to submit information on such items that can integrate with the protective clothing layers being developed under PM-Air Warrior's Air Soldier program.  Information is being sought on commercial off the shelf (COTS) items, as well as items currently under development.  Candidate solutions should ideally be capable of meeting most, if not all of the requirements listed below.  Information on items that do not necessarily meet all the requirements, but could potentially achieve the desired capability with slight modifications, is also of interest.  In other words, the requirements below should illustrate the capability and form factor that is desired, but if a concept exists that would require some modifications, respondents are encouraged to submit that information as well.<br><br>Liquid Pass Through (LPT) Requirements<br><br> 	-The internal LPT coolant fluid passages should not leak when pressurized to 25 psi<br> 	-Pressure drop through the coolant fluid passage should not exceed 0.25 pound per square -inch gauge (psig) at a fluid flow rate of 12 gallons per hour (gph)<br> 	-Interface with 3/16" ID x 5/16" OD plasticized PVC tubing for inlet and outlet coolant fluid passages<br> 	-Integrate with protective bi-layer and tri-layer barrier fabrics with thicknesses ranging from 0.010" to 0.050" (uncompressed)<br> 	-Seal against external environmental threats consisting of: water immersion at 4 psi (approximate 9 foot depth) <br> 	-Must meet performance requirements after environmental exposures of: high/low temperature transportation/storage, solar radiation, salt fog, blowing sand and dust, fluid contaminants, and humidity as described in MIL-STD-810G.  <br> 	-Weight should be minimized, not to exceed 120 grams<br> 	-Volume should be minimized, not to exceed 5.5 in3; thickness not to exceed 0.75 inch<br> 	-Shall neither be vulnerable to corrosion nor itself be a source of corrosion<br> 	-Must use common tools for repair, and maintenance; no custom tools<br> 	-No sharp edges<br><br>Responders are invited and encouraged to submit the following in response to this Special Notice:  <br>1. Material technical description (i.e. fabrication, materials, construction, item dimensions, specification sheet).<br>2. Technology maturity (i.e., Technology Readiness Level) and availability (e.g. in production now; under development or concept - if technology is not currently available, please provide estimated timeframe).<br>3.

<DESC>Date: 28 Feb 2012	
This is a pre-solicitation notice for Foam Insulation Installation Services in accordance with FAR Part 5.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Birmingham Veteran Affairs Medical Center (BVAMC), 700 S. 19th Street, Birmingham, AL 35233 is seeking sources for  a potential contract to provide injected foam insulation services at the Tuscaloosa Medical Centers located at 3701 Loop Road, East, Tuscaloosa, AL 35404.   The finished installation restores thermal efficiency; prolongs the life of piping systems; prevents ground water intrusion; and eliminates visible steam vapor on campus.  The process shall create minimal disruption during application and the steam system shall remain in service during application.  The intended contract is anticipated for a one time buy of services required.
Anticipated Award date is 2 April 2012.  Field Investigations, demolition, and installation shall generally begin within 45 days of contract award and substantial/final completion shall be accomplished within 175 days after start of work.
Transmittal. Transmissions to the GPE must be in accordance with the interface description available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.
Contract Line Item Number:  
CLIN 0001 Installation by injection approx 1,452 LF of foam insulation into steam trenches and rickwil system.  Quantity of 1 job.

The successful offeror must provide all labor, trained technicians, supervision, warehousing, materials, travel, mobilization, subsistence, consumable supplies, pumping/metering equipment and chemicals to inject a high-temperature, rigid polyisocyanurate foam into the concrete trenches that currently house steam and condensate piping.  Such foam insulation shall be capable of withstanding 400F in continuous service and 450F in intermittent/peak service.

The injected formulation (Condufill or equal) must be non-hazardous and shall expand to a volumetric ratio of not less than 30 to 1, filling all voids between the surface of the interior conduit surface and the insulated (or hot surface) of its internal piping.  The formulation shall have a nominal density of 3.5 lbs/ft, a K-Factor of .18 btu/inch/hr-ft-degree F, a water absorption rate of < 2%, a closed-cell content of >95%, a compressive strength no greater than 17.5 psi and a dimensional stability of not less than -0.20%.  The successful offeror shall furnish certified laboratory test data verifying that the proposed product meets these requirements.

The process of injecting the flowable rigid insulation into the steam trenches shall be conducted while the steam piping is operating and at standard steam system operating temperatures. Access ports necessary for the injection of the chemical components shall be provided by means of air-vacuum excavation equipment in order to minimize disruption to the surfaces above the steam trenches.  

Entry through the surface of the metal/concrete conduits, and cutting of such conduits to access the target voids shall be made by torches, grinders or diamond core drill bits.  Injection shall be made through tubing that is capable of withstanding standard steam system operating temperatures and the voids shall be completely filled with the expanding high-temperature foam insulation.  All street, sidewalk and other ground surfaces penetrated to gain access to the steam trenches shall be fully restored to their original condition following the injection process.

The following four tasks are required:

1. Thermally repair the following sections of concrete steam trenches that currently house steam or condensate piping on the Tuscaloosa VAMC campus (the standard trench configuration is 24 inches by 36 inches): 
	
Between Bldg#18 and Bldg #3 (approx. 150 LF of 4 HPS and 2 CR)
Between Bldg #3 and Bldg #5 (approx. 460 LF of 6 HPS and 2 CR)
Between Bldg #12 and Bldg #17 (approx. 80 LF of 2 LPS and 1.5 DCR)
Between Bldg #39 and Bldg #40 (approx.125 LF of 4 MPS, 2.5 CR and 1.5 DCR)
Between Bldg #40 and Bldg #33 (approx. 170 LF of 6 MPS and 2 CR)
Between MH#41 (north) to Bldg #12 (approx. 320 LF of 6 MPS and 2 CR)
Bldg #41 to MH#41 (approx. 85 LF of 2.5 MPS and 1.25 CR)
Bldg #33 to MH#41 (approx. 60 LF of 6 MPS, 2 CR and 1 DCR)

2. Thermally repair insulation with conduit from Bldg #3 to MH#1 Ricwil (approximately 520 LF of 6HPS in 14diameter steel casing).  Access the Ricwil system from MH#1 and from non-intrusive vacuum digs above the line. All access points to the concrete conduit will be by air-vacuum excavation equipment and each dig will be temporarily shored with 12 schedule 40 PVC pipe.  Accessing Ricwil piping from above ground is labor intensive and requires an excavation every 10 feet along the line.  

3. The successful offeror shall measure, design, manufacture, and install custom-made Removable Insulation Covers (RIC) for all applicable steam piping in MH#1, MH#3, MH#5 and MH#41. This will include stripping of existing and disposing of insulation in MH#3, MH#5 and MH#4.  Asbestos remediation is not included and shall be the VAs responsibility.  These RICs will be specially fabricated with a grey LFP 2109 PTFE-coated outer jacketing and a hydrophobic 20 mm Pyrogel XT insulation mat that is designed to repel water in flood-prone manhole environments. 

4. The successful offeror shall install (via cold tap method) three (3) steam driven Sump Ejector Pumps for Tuscaloosa VA in 3 vaults (MH#1, MH#3, and MH#41).  Asbestos remediation is not included and will be the VAs responsibility.  
All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency and posted on www.Fedbid.com under VA247-12-R-0024 on 15 March 2012.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a sole-source procurementto each of the following companies for the following efforts:  ITT Space Systems Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS); Ball Aerospace and Technologies  Ozone Mapping andProfiler Suite (OMPS); Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems  Advanced TechnologyMicrowave Sounder (ATMS).NASA/GSFC was directed to implement the restructuring of the National Polar-OrbitingOperational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). The existing program was managedthrough a tri-agency organization and this governance was eliminated and the primaryresponsibility of the after orbit satellites now belongs to the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA). These satellites provide civil weather forecasting and climate data in a programnow called the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS).As part of that transition, NASA assumed responsibility for the instruments and convertedthe existing instrument subcontracts to NASA prime contracts. NASA only issued primecontracts on the instrument units that were currently under construction on the NPOESScontract including: three Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer (VIIRS) units, two CrIS, twoOMPS, and one ATMS (a second ATMS was procured under a separate NASA contract). The VIIRSquantities converted support three missions (NPP, JPSS-1, and JPSS-2), while the CrIS,OMPS, and ATMS quantities support two missions (NPP and JPSS-1). A sole-sourceprocurement is thus sought for the remaining instruments to be manifested on the JPSS-2mission (CrIS, OMPS, ATMS).  To maintain data continuity, NOAA must use instruments with the same performance as thecurrent instruments. Any new instrument design would drive changes and costs to theexisting program and would not meet NOAAs technical, schedule, and budget parameters.This would force a delay in the JPSS-2 development thereby increasing the risk of aweather and climate data gap. The above-mentioned contractors are uniquely qualified forthese contracts as they are currently building their respective instruments and are theonly ones capable of making copies, because access to the necessary intellectual propertydata is not available to the public at large.  Subsequently, they are the only sourcesthat can ensure data continuity for weather and storm forecasting.Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)  Only OneResponsible Source. However, any organization who believes they can provide these itemswithout any detrimental impact to the program mission should fully identify theirinterest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of the synopsis.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform anyof these efforts in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 5:00 pm ETon March 16, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The National Institute of Health intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order to BD Biosciences, LLC, 2350 Qume Drive., San Jose, CA 95131-1807, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible, No Other Supplier or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement, 41.U.S.C. 253 (c)(1). This requirement is to provide an upgrade to an existing Canto II flow cytometer in the Department of Laboratory Medicine's Hematology Service, National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Department of Laboratory Medicine serves as the clinical laboratory of the NIH, Clinical Center. It provides laboratory support for patient care and research protocols and performs research and training in disciplines of Clinical Pathology. In doing so it provides state-of-the-art laboratory testing in support of Clinical Center patient care and serves as a center of excellence in research and training in laboratory medicine, particularly in areas which utilize the unique strengths of the National Institutes of Health.
<p><br />BD Biosciences is the only known vendor that can provide the necessary instrument upgrades that are compatible with the existing BD Canto II flow cytometer. The current flow cytometer is equipped with two (2) lasers which limit its analytical capacity to 6-color immunofluorescence. In order to increase its ability to measure a higher number of fluorochromes, the instrument needs to be upgraded to a three (3) laser, 8-color (10 parameters) cytometer with a corresponding increase in detectors and electronic complexity. A higher number of colors will enable a more complete sample analysis; lower the cost of supplies, reduce analytical time and require a decreased number of cells, which is important in samples with scant material.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System Code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees. The requirement is being processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1).</p>
<p>The procurement shall be awarded on/or by March 16, 2012.</p>
<p>Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this notice if they are capable to meet the needs of this requirement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. <br /><br />The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirements established above. All responses must be received no later than March 8, 2012, 12:00PM, eastern standard time. Please email Malinda Dehner, Contract Specialist, at dehnerm@cc.nih.gov with technical questions or written responses pertaining to this notice. No phone calls please.</p>

<DESC>Introduction
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), has a requirement to enhance the capacity of foreign clinical sites to design, conduct and manage clinical research projects.</p>
<p>Description<br /><br />As part of NIAID's mission to advance the global health agenda, DMID supports a spectrum of international clinical research involving sites in resource-limited countries and focusing on those infectious diseases which disproportionately affect the populations residing in those countries. As of 2009, DMID-supported research in international settings included nearly 650 projects, more than of half of which involve human subjects. The work is distributed in 74 countries, 55 of which are resource-limited, through grants and contracts to foreign institutions, grants to U.S. institutions conducting international clinical research, and through multiple research groups.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the DMID international infectious disease research agenda involves enhancing the capacity of foreign sites to design, conduct and manage clinical and non-clinical research projects, including compliance with regulatory requirements and established guidelines and standards for the conduct of human subjects research. In order to enhance clinical research capabilities at international clinical sites, DMID awarded a contract in FY2005, under the title "International Clinical Sciences Support," to provide training and assistance to such clinical sites with respect to various aspects of clinical research. The contract awarded under this solicitation will continue this effort.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a level of effort type contract will be awarded. The Government's requirement for the work set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW) of this solicitation is estimated at 9360 labor hours per contract year based upon the assumption of 4.5 FTE's with a FTE being defined as 2080 hours. This requirement will consist of one (1) base period of one (1) year and six (6) one (1) year option periods. The labor hours are inclusive of vacation, sick, and holiday time. <br /><br />In addition to the Base requirements sited above, during each contract year the Government may exercise options up to 5 (five) times a year for additional level of effort by up to (0.3) FTE's (624 labor hours) in Principal Investigator/Project Manager, Professional, Technical support to respond to emerging needs related to the proposed research.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about November 1, 2011 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to the New York University School of Medicine (New York University Sleep Institute), 550 First Avenue, New York, NY  10016 for the analyses of modified polysomnograms obtained from NIMH's cohort of children with autism.  The New York University Sleep Institute will (1) examine polysomnography for sleep stages I-IV (N1-N3), REM percentage as a fraction of total sleep time, and latencies to particular stages, sleep efficiency and other parameters of the sleep/wake cycle, (2) use standard GRASS telefactor software to calculate sleep staging and (3) read studies in parallel with Program to achieve rater reliability.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the work is to be conducted at the New York University Sleep Institute, which is well equipped to provide the tools to allow the experts to properly analyze such data.&nbsp; The New York University Sleep Institute has an expert, Dr. Alcibiades Rodriguez, which is fellowship trained in neurology, epilepsy and sleep and is a practicing clinician in sleep disorders.  Correct analyses of sleep data on children with autism and possibly epileptic abnormalities can be quite challenging and is best done by neurologists who have formal sleep and epilepsy training and extensive experience in reading such studies. Dr. Rodriguez works closely with NYU's epilepsy center and he is familiar with the neurophysiology of persons with autism and developmental disabilities.  He has consistently provided NIMH with high quality analyses of their pediatric polysomnograms over the last several years. Dr. Rodriguez is currently in the process of reading the follow-up polysmnographic examinations from NIMH's ongoing, longitudinal study of sleep in three cohorts of young children. These re-reads must be done by the same reader to ensure that there is continuity in testing and consistency in coding across the entire study sample. In addition, analysis of these samples must be done by the appropriate laboratory.&nbsp; Analyses performed via this contract will allow researchers in the Pediatrics &amp; Developmental Neurosciences Branch to accomplish the goals of several clinical research protocols in various stages of development.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months with option(s) for up to four additional one-year periods.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR 12 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 10:00 AM E.T., March 5, 2012 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NNDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2370900 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HHS-NIH-NIDA (MH)-12-029 to re-compete a requirement currently being performed under NIMH Contract N01MH-4-1001 with Compound Focus, Inc. entitled: "NIH Small Molecule Repository (SMR)". This acquisition is being accomplished using full and open competitive procedures under NAICS Code 541711. It is anticipated that a single indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contract will be awarded for a potential period of performance of up to ten (10) years beginning on or about September 1, 2012. It is anticipated that this requirement will expand the scope of the current repository operation. <br />
<p><br />The NIH Small Molecule Repository (SMR), initiated in 2004, was developed as part of the Molecular Libraries Program, an NIH Common Fund Initiative. The goals of the SMR are to identify, acquire, maintain, and distribute a collection of chemically diverse compounds with known and unknown biological activities for use in high-throughput screening (HTS). These compounds are intended to serve as starting material for the development of chemical probes to explore basic biology, as well as leads for therapeutics development.</p>
<p>Contract services are solicited to continue to provide services to store, maintain, and distribute the current library collection, supporting certain NIH-supported screening Centers. In addition, as part of NIH's continuing efforts to support translational science, components of the SMR compound library may be made available more broadly, to support other NIH screening and translational efforts, as well as selected extramural groups conducting HTS for probe and drug discovery. Library development efforts will continue to shape, improve, and expand the collection.</p>
<p>The SMR is a vital component of the Molecular Libraries Program (MLP). The MLP requires constant access to the SMR compound collection in order to carry out its activities. The SMR currently contains approximately 380,000 compounds. An increase in the ultimate compound collection size is anticipated, with an expansion of the repository function beyond the current operation, although the size of the final collection cannot be determined at this time. Offerors will be requested to document their ability to expand current capacity to support the growth of the SMR up to a maximum of 650,000 compounds. The current library can be viewed in the NIH database PubChem, using the search term "MLSMR" at: http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/search.cgi. <br />General information:</p>
<p>This is a Presolicitation Notice in advance of the Request for Proposal (RFP), and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP, HHS-NIH-NIDA(MH)-12-029, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offeror's proposal will be available electronically on or about March 15, 2012, and may be accessed through the Internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper copies will be available. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government. Proposals will be due on or about May 1, 2012. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation notice corresponds to the Small Business Sources Sought notice #HHS-NIH-NIDA-SBSS-11-001 and Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice # HHS-NIH-NIDA-RDSS-11-001, same title as above, which were previously posted on September 1, 2011.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about the end of the 2nd quarter of FY 2012 for an anticipated four-year Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Contract for the USAID/Colombia Access to Justice Activity (AJA).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of this activity is to strengthen access to justice in Colombia. Access to justice is the ability to obtain a just and timely remedy for violations of rights as put forth in national and international norms and standards. Access to justice allows citizens to enforce their rights against infringement by the state, powerful private interests, and even those who may similarly be marginalized. These infringements often affect the poor and vulnerable segments of society, especially women, who have the least knowledge of and access to legal recourse. The basic premise of this project is that greater access to justice is a cornerstone for the rule of law which, in turn, is a key element for the establishment of democracy. This is particularly true in the Colombian consolidation regions, where establishment of the rule of law contributes to building the legitimacy of the state. The activity represents the continuation of USAID/Colombia rule of law programming and is expected to consolidate prior gains, strengthen institutions, and heighten the focus in consolidation areas. The activity's main objectives will be to promote greater access to justice in consolidation municipalities primarily through the services offered by justice houses and alternate dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms; provide support to institutions and organizations at the municipal level to assist in helping to meet the justice needs of women; and support justice sector institutions to implement reforms that improve productivity and the quality of services delivered, especially where reforms have an impact on justice sector performance in consolidation regions.</p>

<CONTACT>Ryan J. Beard, Contracting Officer, Phone 312-353-0697, Email ryan.beard@gsa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for a Switchgear Replacement at the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Ann Arbor, MI. <br /><br />THIS IS NOT AN OPEN MARKET PROCUREMENT. A JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 6.302-2, UNUSUAL AND COMPELLING URGENCY. <br /><br />The statutory authority for the proposed action is FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency. This authority applies in situations where the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals. <br /><br />Request for Proposal (RFP) GS-05P-11-SV-C-0017 for the project, Switchgear Replacement, was issued via FedBizOpps.gov on August 2, 2011 with a closing date and time of September 1, 2011, 4:00pm Central Standard Time. <br /><br />A contract award was made on September 29, 2011 to the contractor offering the best value to the Government. After award and prior to the commencement of any work, a bi-lateral agreement (no-cost settlement termination for convenience) was reached with the contractor. <br /><br />The requirement for the work still exists and the present switchgear is old, past its useful life and showing signs of excessive wear. Aside from almost frequent repair work, some parts are no longer available. The GFI breakers inside the switchgear are breaking down. In light of the aforementioned, immediate replacement is necessary to avoid electrical power failure in the event of a major breakdown. <br /><br />GSA determined it would be in the best interest of the Government to award the contract to the contractor providing the best value had the prior contractor not been given the initial award. This company, Allied Building Services, represents the best value to the Government.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: This is a request for information/market research to provide data for planning purposes. This sources sought synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.
<p>The Air Armament Center, Operational Contracting Office, Eglin AFB, Florida, is seeking potential sources capable of providing all equipment, tools, materials, logistics, technical support, and other items and services necessary provide an ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispenser System Mission Data Verification System (CMDSMDVS) for Eglin AFB, Florida.</p>
<p>Requirement:<br /><br />The CMDSMDVS is a dual cabinet configuration capable of housing the ALE-47 and ALQ-213 systems in a 10 Digital Sequencer Switch (DSS) configuration with aircraft/simulated controls for the F-16, HC/MC-130, EC-130H, MC-12, HH-60 and A-10 aircraft t. The CMDSMDVS consists of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) consoles with a specially designed wiring harness to duplicate aircraft installs and faceplate panels for system, subsystem control, signal interconnect and monitoring. The CMDSMDVS consists of two 24" wide cabinets designed with mounting provisions for the ALE-47 and ALQ-213 specific Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), interface hardware, power supplies and cooling fans. System LRUs are accessible from both the front and rear of the cabinets and securely mounted with the connectors facing the rear for easy removal and replacement. <br />One cabinet, referred to as the Basic Console, has the system control and display LRUs mounted in the front panel and secured by a threaded back plate or dzus bracket to allow removal from the front without the risk of loose hardware being dropped into the CMDSMDVS. It also has provisions for mounting 3 DSS and 6 dispensers and can operate as a standalone unit. The system wiring harness has a sufficient service loop to allow these LRUs to be removed/replaced from the front panel without requiring access to the inside of the console. The capability to connect a Memory Loader Verifier/ Common Aircraft Portable Reprogramming Equipment or equivalent to reprogram the installed system (via 1553 bus/aircraft style connection) is provided on the front panel. In addition, an interface connector is also provided on the front panel to allow the CMDSMDVS to be interconnected and support mission data verification in an integrated mode, via discrete lines and 1553 bus, to the other on board EW systems (ALR-69, ALR-56M, ALQ-211 AAR-44, AAR-47, and AAR-54) installed in the different aircraft configurations. All signal injection points, measurement and monitoring points, and cable access used on a routine basis are accessible from the front panel of the console. <br />The second cabinet/console, referred to as the Companion console, is capable of interfacing with the Basic console to extend the capability to a 10 DSS configuration. The console will contain all the hardware and wiring to support 7 DSSs mounted internally with 14 Dispensers (buckets), and 4 simulated Safety Switches mounted in the front panel. Individual power supplies and interface connections (both discrete and bus) will be provided in the console. The companion console will interface with the basic console via a single umbilical cable between the two consoles. Magazine Present and payload switches will be provided on the front panel, to allow the operator to select the type of payloads installed. <br />The CMDSMDVS consoles are designed to operate on 60 Hz 115 VAC power with all necessary power supplies required for systems operation mounted internally in the console. Input power to the console is controlled through a single circuit breaker in series with an Emergency Shutoff switch, thus providing a single power interrupt in the event of an emergency. In addition, a power strip, with its own circuit breaker and ON/OFF switch, is installed in the front of the Basic console to provide non-interrupted power for ancillary equipment. Test points to monitor the input power to the console, output of the internal power supplies, and internal system operating voltages are available on the front panel.<br />The COTS cabinets have hinged rear door with lift-off hinges and lift-off side panels to allow for quick and easy access to the inside of each cabinet. The cabinets are also equipped with locking swivel casters to permit easy movement of the console within the laboratory. In addition, the cabinet base has provisions built in for lifting with a fork lift. The cabinet includes cooling fans to ensure a positive air flow for cooling. Size of each console is such that it easily fits through a standard door opening (34.75" wide x 83" high).<br />Console wiring harnesses and cables provide the voltage, signal, control, bus interconnections and interfaces to allow the CMDSMDVS to operate as if it were installed in an aircraft. The CMDSMDVS wiring harness supports the installation and operation of up to 10 Digital Sequencer Switches, 6 Safety Switches (1 actual and 5 simulated by toggle switch), 20 Dispensers (D-49 Bucket), 1 Remote Dispense Switch, 1 Programmer, and 1 Cockpit Display Unit (CDU) of the basic ALE-47 CMDS. In addition, the wiring harness also supports independent use of the F-16, HC/MC-130, EC-130H, MC-12, HH-60 and A-10 aircraft ALE-47 and ALQ-213 controls. Aircraft ID switches are provided on the front panel to allow the operator to select the aircraft type being verified. Magazine Present, and payload switches are provided on the front panel to allow the operator to select payloads installed (growth/options). Aircraft peculiar switches (i.e. Weight-on-Wheels (WOW), manual dispense, station circuit breakers, and remote dispense) are available on the front panel and wired as they are on the aircraft. <br />The breakout panel on the front of the CMDSMDVS provides both EW and Avionics (AV) bus and stub connections for monitoring or interconnection of equipment/systems to the busses. Bus terminations for each front panel bus connection are provided to terminate the bus connection, when not in operation, to prevent ambiguous/interference signals from being applied to the bus. AN/ALE-47 CMDS squib and logic power test points are also available on the CMDSMDVS breakout panel.<br />An internal Missile Warning System (MWS) pulse simulator circuit card assembly (CCA) is provided to allow AN/ALE-47 integrated MD verification. AN/AAR-47 and AN/AAR-54 MWS interfaces to the CMDSMDVS are provided via discrete signal lines from the MWS or the simulated MWS input circuitry.<br />Payload simulator CCAs will provide simulated load circuitry of the payloads in a variety of chaff and flare types such as the MJU-7, M206, RR-170, RR-180 dual chaff, and/or OTHER expendables for up to 10 DSS consisting of 20 independent dispenser magazines. One Payload simulator CCA is used for each dispenser. Payload simulator CCAs and wiring will be installed in the CMDSMDVS in such a way as to allow the CMDSMDVS to operate with either the actual buckets installed in the console or payload simulator CCAs, or a combination of both buckets and payload CCAs. The payload sim CCAs are designed to function with or without a host computer. In addition to simulating the CMDS payloads, the amplitude (current) and pulse width of the individual fire pulses will be monitored, detected, measured and time tagged to allow the operator to easily verify the fire pulse characteristics and timing of a dispense action (single dispense or burst/salvo of expendables) resulting from a threat signal or manual dispense command. Pulse and timing information is transferred to a host computer for display, and archiving for post test analysis.<br />The 1553 Bus Simulator has the capability to allow user modification of message data during test and the ability to support pre-programmed message data for dynamic scenarios. Message data formats will be based on Government-provided interface description documents for the various systems under test.<br />The bus simulator design for the CMDSMDVS has four 1553 channels with the capability to generate, input, and capture EW and AV bus messages for the ALE-47 and ALQ-213 systems, to include message traffic into and out of the CMDS systems in support of mission data verification with other onboard EW systems (Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and MWS)). This information will be recorded and displayed as a scrolling text file as well as being saved to a data file. <br />At the completion of mission data verification or system "run," the operator has the ability to select any or all MIL-STD-1553 and discrete message data for permanent storage to a disk file. The data is stored in a commonly accepted, readily importable data format such as ASCII text, comma-delimited values, etc, that can be imported into a standard spreadsheet or database application such as Microsoft Excel or Access. Total storage capacity may be limited by system storage capability/disk space. A maximum captured data file size (buffer) of 10MB is planned for real-time data recording. When this buffer is full, it will be written to a large capacity storage device such as a Compact Disk or Digital Video Disk for permanent storage.</p>
<p><br />The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price requirements type contract. The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the future acquisition is 541380, with a small business size standard of $12.0 Million. If qualified and interested, please submit an email/fax/letter stating the name of your company, your interest, a Capabilities Statement, and your business size: indicating whether you are a small or large business for the purposes of the assigned NAICS code.

INFORMATION REQUEST
The Government seeks informed input and questions from interested companies regarding technical requirements and contractual descriptions regarding an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone abuse in urine.  Attachment 1 contains a sample, theoretical Statement of Work (SOW) which details the projected requirements interested responders shall base their submission upon.
  This sample does NOT indicate that the Government will contract for any of the supplies or services discussed within; it is merely a forecast of potential requirements to generate interest and feedback from companies in order to better inform the Government.  Responses will not be rated but will be reviewed as part of an information gathering process.  
The white paper shall address the following two sections:
Section 1 - Technical Requirements
While responding directly to the sample Statement of Work (SOW) within Attachment 1, the white paper shall address the technical requirements based on the SOW provided within the Attachment.  This should be a brief, informal section stating any specific interest, inquiries, capabilities, solutions, expertise, and past experience related to the technical requirements listed in the SOW.
  Comments and suggested revisions to the SOW are also requested.
Section 2 - Questions
Is your company currently producing an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone abuse in urine that is able to meet the requirements based on the Statement of Work provided in the Attachment? 
If not, does your company plan on producing an immunoassay urine reagent kit for the detection of hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone? If so, how long would it take to be able to meet such requirement?
If your company is currently in the process of producing a hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone reagent kit, at what stage of production is the kit at? What is the predicted date of completion?
BACKGROUND
The DOD drug testing program performs testing for a number of drugs of abuse to include codeine, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone.
  On or about 1 May 2012, hydrocodone and hydromorphone will be added to the testing panel.  In order to maximize efficiency, the drug testing program started using a prescription medication database to compare positive service member test results with their medication to determine whether a valid prescription is the cause for the positive result.  Due to the high cross-reactivity of existing opiate (codeine and morphine) immunoassay kits with hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone, it is not currently possible to validate a positive opiate screening result against the prescription database.  The DOD drug testing program is interested in seeing if a kit exists that can separate out the positive hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone specimens from the positive opiate (codeine and morphine) specimens.

Wade, E-mail: michael.s.wade@us.army.mil<br>Primary NAICS Code:	541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services) <br>Place of Performance: The services to be performed under this contract will be performed at Government Facilities throughout 54 states and territories<br><br>The National Guard Bureau (NGB) Operational Contracting Division, on behalf of the Office of the Joint Surgeon, NGB, is conducting market research to determine the availability of firms to provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform Psychological Support Services for the Reserve Components of the military services.<br><br>This sources sought announcement/market survey is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a solicitation, the announcement of a solicitation or any form of commitment by the Government. A contract may not be awarded as a result of this announcement. <br><br>The purpose of this 'Sources Sought/Market Survey' is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and to develop additional knowledge of the existing market for the required services. Feedback on individual submissions will not be provided. <br><br>Capability Packages:<br><br>Small businesses are encouraged to submit capability packages; however, the size of this acquisition is anticipated to exceed the established small business size threshold for the NAICS codes determined to be appropriate for this requirement.  Interested small business concerns that are qualified as a HUBZone, or other small business categories in NAICS code 541611 with a size standard of $7,000,000.00 are encouraged to submit their capability packages.  The Government reserves the right to reserve any portion of this requirement for Small Business Concerns and will maintain a list of interested and qualified entities.<br><br>Businesses having the ability to provide the services listed in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement shall provide clear and comprehensive information supporting their experience, expertise, and current company profile to include the number of employees, office location(s), DUNS number, CAGE code, small business designation/status claimed and annual revenue. Furthermore, responses should identify the specific task areas in Section 5.0 that the organization is capable of performing. The capability packages for this 'sources sought/market survey' are not expected to be proposals, but rather statements regarding the company's existing experience in relation to the areas specified in the PWS.   <br><br><br>Capability Packages should clearly address the following areas:<br><br>1. Technical understanding of the work: The National Guard Bureau (NGB), the representative agency for the National Guard (NG), a reserve component of the U.S Department of Defense (DOD) has the urgent need to provide mental health support services per provision 10 U.S.C., Chapter 55; Section 723, National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007, Pub. L. 109-163 and the Report of the DOD Task Force on Mental Health (TFMH), June 2007, specifically behavioral health and support services for NG Service Members as part of pre-deployment resiliency training and post deployment reintegration to civilian life.10 U.S.C., Chapter 55 establishes: federal responsibility for Prevention, Mitigation, and Treatment of Blast Injuries (Pub. L. 109-163 (1) (D); Access to Health Care Services for Beneficiaries Eligible for TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care (Pub. L. 107-314, (A), (C); Health Care Management Demonstration Program (Pub. L. 106-398, (a), (b, 1-2),  specifically to improve, develop and maintain intervention and rehabilitation programs for returning troops who have developed post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), experienced traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and/or other behavioral health problems associated with an individual's inability to reintegrate into civilian life. Some states and local communities currently lack access, coordination and/or professional intervention services of mental health providers and related support systems. The NG faces unique challenges to provide mental health support to its Service Members. NG Armories and Wings are community based and are seldom within the catchment area of a military treatment facility; and have varying degrees of capabilities between communities and states. Since the NG does not provide treatment, all treatment is received externally through the Military Health System, TRICARE, the Veterans Health Administration (VA), health insurance provided through a NG Service Member's or civilian spouse's civilian employer, and personal finances.  Additionally, psychological health is not a standardized program of the NG, resulting in an inconsistency between psychological health needs and a state's/territory's ability to design and implement a psychological health program.  This contract also addresses the recommendations: 5.4.1.6, 5.4.1.10, 5.4.1.11, 5.4.1.12, 5.4.1.14 of the DOD Plan to Achieve the Vision of the DOD Task Force on Mental Health, September 2007 Report to Congress; "to place a Director of Psychological Health at each of the 54 Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ)", for Army National Guard (ARNG) and Air National Guard (ANG), under direction of the state Adjutant General (TAG) who may appoint a Joint Director for oversight.  Based on a NG underlying principle that no Service Member will be left behind, the PH services to be delivered under this contract are NG Service Member based psychological health services designed to help achieve and maintain NG Service Members' readiness for deployment, and to help members address the full range of behavioral and mental health problems developed during deployment as a means of facilitating reentry to civilian life.  Services are to be part of a comprehensive overall effort to support Service Member readiness and better cope with the sequelae of TBI and/or PTSD. They are to decrease the stigma associated with seeking mental health services as well as improve access to qualified mental health providers at the critical point, when a NG Service Member or dependent recognizes the need for mental health intervention.  PWS sections 1.8 and 5.<br><br>2.  Key Personnel: Do the key staff members have the analytical, functional and technical knowledge/ experience directly related to tasks outlined in the PWS; have sufficient resources on hand and available to begin work on the effort; have or have the ability to obtain a minimum of a secret clearance? Demonstrate technical knowledge, experience, and understanding of behavioral health relevant to accomplish the required service. PWS sections 1.8-1.8.6.<br><br>3.  Past Performance:  Do you have specific past performance and experience with staffing behavioral health personnel or similar work equivalent to PWS tasks? The Contractor is to be knowledgeable of the range and scope of other NG, DOD, Army, and Air Force programs and services appropriate for meeting client needs, including the additional military eligibilities available when Service Members are activated.  The Contractor also will assure that the DPH within a State, territory or Wing is connecting with other federal, state, local and community based programs to assure that all possible resources are leveraged and that all Service Members' needs are met.  The Contractor will refer and connect clients with military resources when eligible for them and with other resources as clinically and financially appropriate.  PWS sections 1.4-1.5 and PWS section 5.<br><br>4.  Knowledge of Specific Technical Requirements: The purpose of this contract is to deliver PH support services, designed for effective delivery within the National Guard structure and culture. The Contractor will identify and provide Directors of Psychological Health (DPHs) in the states/territories and at additional locations as to be outlined in the future. DPHs will be responsible for design and delivery of PH services tailored to local unique needs.  At the discretion of the Command at each location and with approval by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), they also will administratively manage various NG programs and directives related to PH services to ensure effective integrated comprehensive services meeting Service Members' needs.  Services will be delivered throughout the United States including the District of Columbia, Pacific Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wherever Army or Air National Guard Service Members and their dependents are located. As part of their proposals, offerors are requested to consider the services to be delivered and to describe the offeror's recent experience both at the corporate and the state level in: working with customer organizations to understand and meet their needs; demonstrating value relative to psychological health core competencies; demonstrating outcomes from the services delivered; and in demonstrating overall Return On Investment for the National Guard.  Offerors also are requested to describe as part of their proposal how the offeror, if awarded this contract, at both the corporate, Wing and State level, would work with NGB, the wings, states and territories, to accomplish the four functions listed in the above paragraph. PWS section 5, specific tasks.<br><br><br>A draft PWS is attached for your information.  This document is not in final form and is subject to change.<br><br>In addition, the following questions must be answered and elaborated on as part of the package:  <br><br>(1) Financial Capability- Does your firm have the financial capability to withstand a negative cash flow of at least ($30,000.00) per month? <br><br>(2) Past Performance- Does your firm have relevant past performance experience within the last three years? <br><br>(3) Corporate Experience- Does your firm have the work experience similar in nature, scope, complexity, value and difficulty of work in the PWS? <br>Interested parties should submit the information requested above by 29 February 2011, 12:00 pm EDT to michael.s.wade@us.army.mil. Please include company name, address, telephone number, and technical point of contact, brochures/literature. Capability packages must not exceed 30 pages (12 point font with one-inch borders, not including pictures, brochures and Market Survey), must be submitted electronically and should clearly indicate whether the organization is able to provide the services listed in the Draft Performance Work Statement. All contractor questions must be submitted no later than 12:00 PM EDT on Monday, 13 February 2011 to the contract specialist, CPT Michael S. Wade at e-mail: michael.s.wade@us.army.mil. Telephone calls regarding this notice will not be accepted. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<p><strong>The purpose of this SS is to identify businesses that are interested in a study of Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria subjects on "Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes".</strong></p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p><br />THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible businesses, under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 923120.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /><br /></span></strong>The mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health (CRGGH) is to advance research into the role of culture, lifestyle, genetics and genomics in health disparities. The CRGGH will develop genetic epidemiology models and conduct population genetics research that explores the patterns and determinants of common complex diseases, such as Type 2 Diabetes, hypertension and obesity in the US, Africa and China. The CRGGH will give particular thought to ways in which scientist document and describe the non-random pattern of human genetic variation and its link to disease risks in different populations. <br /><br />The overall goal of the Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health (CRGGH) project on the genetics of type 2 diabetes among Yoruba is to accumulate sufficient number of cases and controls (n &gt; 4000 persons) to conduct Whole Genome Association studies (GWAS). The current proposal will contribute 400 persons (200 unrelated T2D subjects and 200 ethnicity matched controls) to this larger effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives for the project are</span></strong>:</p>
<p>1. Enroll and examine 250 unrelated cases of T2D and 250 ethnicity matched controls from Abuja, Nigeria.</p>
<p>2. Conduct clinical examination and complete study questionnaires to obtain demographic and clinical data including age, gender, personal and family health history, blood pressure and anthropometrics.</p>
<p>3. Obtain and process blood samples on each participant. Separate collected biological samples into required aliquot of plasma, serum and DNA.</p>
<p>4. Conduct basic biochemistries on all participants. Biochemistries will include fasting blood glucose, insulin, albumin, and lipid profile (LDL, HDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol).</p>
<p>5. Ship collected samples to the CRGGH at the NIH/NHGRI.</p>
<p>6. The project is expected to be completed in 12 months starting from the date of initial award.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognize that it is critical to establish relationships with organizations that encourage and foster communication and information access. A major effort to enhance understanding of information needs, resources, and services began in June 1993 when NLM and the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) cosponsored a conference that brought together users of NIH information resources including health care providers, scientists, information specialists, journalists, and members of the community affected by HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the conference was to review the various HIV/AIDS information services, assess current efforts with respect to needs, and identify additional needs. The resultant recommendations were widely circulated and continue to be utilized for planning and informational purposes. The conference report is available on the NLM AIDS Web Site http://www.sis.nlm.nih.gov/hiv/nihrpt.pdf.</p>
<p>Patients and the affected community want access to the most up-to-date and accurate health information to manage their care and make informed decisions about their health. Health care providers and health educators also need access to the most current information to provide the highest quality of care. Information access disparities exist in many communities that are affected by the digital divide. NLM is committed to assisting community-based organizations in accessing the spectrum of information resources and services that are currently available.</p>
<p>As a result of the recommendations made during the conference, the National Library of Medicine issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for AIDS Community Information Outreach projects in May of 1994. Between 1995 and 2011, similar solicitations were issued (see http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/outreach/aids_cio_projects.html for a list of past award recipients). The goal of the AIDS Community Information Outreach funding is to improve access to HIV/AIDS related health information by patients, the affected community, and their caregivers. NLM has continued to issue this solicitation into the year 2011 and has awarded over 270 organizations with funding in an effort to eliminate disparity of information access in the HIV/AIDS Community.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of the AIDS Community Information Outreach Project is to design local programs for improving HIV/AIDS health information access for patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers and the general public. Emphasis is on providing information or access to health and medical information in a way meaningful to the target community, and increasing the awareness and utilization of NLM online health and medical resources in the HIV/AIDS Community. <br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements <br /></strong>Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories:<br /><br />1. Information Retrieval: To provide or improve access to electronic AIDS- and other health-related information resources by the organization or by the clients they serve and to implement access to state-of-the-art AIDS-related information tools via the Internet. This may require the purchase of hardware (computer equipment), software, or contractual relationships necessary to obtain a connection to the Internet for the purpose of accessing AIDS-related information or sharing AIDS-related information;<br /><br />2. Skills Development: Training to develop skills in accessing or using HIV/AIDS-related information including the use of online databases and general AIDS information resources in order to improve services and benefit the community. This may include training for the staff of the agency, development of training programs for clients and patrons, training programs for other agencies, etc. ;<br /><br />3. Resource Development: To support an organization to meet the needs of their clients or communities by developing specific educational or informational materials such as culturally or language specific fact sheets, bibliographies, guides or other products; and/ or <br /><br />4. Document Access: Access to HIV/AIDS-related documents and other types of health information. This may include the development of connections with local health sciences libraries to obtain use of their collections, to procure interlibrary loan services, etc.<br /><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></strong>It is anticipated that the period of performance shall be between twelve (12) and twenty-four (24) months from the date of award. Awards are anticipated to be made in September of 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Other Important Considerations<br /></strong>The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is an RFP available.<br /><br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI):  THIS RFI IS PUBLISHED FOR DATA GATHERING AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR AWARD A CONTRACT.  The government will not reimburse any respondent for any cost associated with information submitted in response to this RFI.  The Navy is interested in obtaining a list of sources capable of proposing, if a Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued, to provide the program management, technical and engineering services necessary to operate and maintain the U.S. Navy's submarine rescue systems.  

BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Navys submarine rescue systems consist of the Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS) and the Submarine Rescue Chamber Flyaway System (SRCFS).
  The SRDRS and SRCFS are stored and maintained at the Deep Submergence Unit (DSU), Naval Base Coronado, San Diego, CA.  The SRDRS is a highly portable and mobile submarine rescue and recompression system capable of transferring personnel from a DISSUB under pressure from depths up to 2,000 feet.  The SRCFS is a highly portable and mobile submarine rescue system capable of transferring personnel from a DISSUB from depths up to 850 feet.   The Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS) (Revision 7 dated 10/14/09), provides a concept of operations for the SRDRS in a representative submarine rescue scenario.  The CONOPS   provides an understanding of the expected roles of SRDRS equipment and personnel.
  The U.S. Navy has a requirement to operate and maintain the submarine rescue systems in an operational condition where the systems must be ready to respond to unforeseen emergencies.  The rescue systems will be located at the shore based facility or conducting at-sea training operations. 
The submarine rescue systems are unique U.S. Navy assets, which must be maintained and certified in accordance with NAVSEA SS800-AG-MAN-010/P9290, Systems Certification Procedures and Criteria Manual for Deep Submergence Systems, Revision A, and NAVSEA SS521-AA-MAN-010, U.S. Navy Diving and Manned Hyperbaric System Safety Certification Manual, October 1987.  In addition, all scope of certification work must be accomplished by an authorized activity in accordance with NAVSEA Note 5000.
  Any respondent not capable of meeting these requirements may not be considered a potential source.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Project Proposals, but for planning purposes only. Aproject award will not be awarded from this announcement. The Government intends to announce a Request for Project Proposals for execution of a project award in support of Ground Robotics related research areas. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the Robotics Technology Consortium, and industry in general, advanced notification of Government intent. 
In December 2007, the Government announced its intent to enter into an Other Transaction Agreement with one (1) consortium in support of Ground Robotics related Research and Development projects. As a result of the Ground Robotics Industry Day in January 2008, one (1) consortium formed, the Robotics Technology Consortium. It is the intent of the Government to make multiple project awards to the members of the Robotics Technology Consortium as a result of member project proposals submitted via the Request for Project Proposals. 
The anticipated two (2) research areas for which project proposals will be sought are the following: (1) Negative Obstacle Detection; and (2) Automated Mobile Communications Relay. The Request for Project Proposals (W15QKN-08-9-0001-RPP16) will be issued to the Robotics Technology Consortiums Administrative Agent, the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, who will then issue the request to the members of the Consortium. For information on the Robotics Technology Consortium and/or how to become a member, visit the following website: http://www.roboticstechc.org/.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command-New Jersey, on behalf of the Project Manager
for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS), Picatinny Arsenal NJ is requesting
information regarding the capability of Industry, Government agencies and
Academia related to technology capabilities for ultra lethal mechanisms 
relative to conventional cannon artillery and mortar indirect fire 
stockpiles.  Proposed technologies should focus on delivering maximum lethal
effects with higher efficiency when compared with the existing conventional
stockpiles while also addressing large area targets, mobile point targets in a
large area and/or poorly located targets with soft, medium and hard protection
profiles.  This market research effort will compile and assess technology
capabilities and maturation in both the near term (0-6 years) and the far term
(7  20 years) based on technology readiness levels (TRL) as defined by 
Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Acquisition University (DAU). Claimed TRL
must be justified based on empirical data and/or development test data.  All
proposed technologies shall take into account a delivery accuracy of 50m CEP.
Proposed technology capabilities should consider but not be limited to the
Program Executive Office Ammunition (PEO AMMO) Insensitive Munition Strategic
Plan (IMSP).  The resultant information will be used to assist PM CAS in
creating materiel development strategies to maximize the cannon artillery and
mortar indirect fires lethal capabilities of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT),
and, in particular, light forces such as the Infantry Brigade Combat Team
(IBCT).  Interested parties (Government, Private Industry and Academia) are
requested to provide a short, 5 page or less (excluding cover page and table
of contents) white paper detailing their quantified technology capabilities
for potential cannon artillery and mortar indirect fire solutions.  It is
preferred that all documents be developed using MS Word and be written in
Times New Roman 12 point font.  The white paper should include a description
of the capability, its substantiated technical maturity based on TRL, and the
point of contact (POC, telephone number and email address).  Please exclude
overarching corporate capabilities or past performance discussions.
 Interested parties (Government, Industry and Academia) may request a follow-
up, in person discussion after 20 April 2012.  This Request for Information
(RFI) if for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for
Proposal (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S.
Government.  No award will be made because of this RFI.  If a formal
solicitation is issued at a later date, a solicitation notice will be
published.
The white paper and briefings will be at no cost and no liability to the
Government and will not be returned.  Product brochures can be sent as
separate electronic documents and will not count against the 5 page limit.
White papers containing classified subject matter should be submitted via the
Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) with a corresponding
unclassified white paper sent to the Non-secure Internet Protocol Router
Network (NIPRNet).  POCs for the white paper are Mr. Philip J. Magnotti (973-
724-2595) and Ms. Karen M. Amabile (973-724-2392).  Your white paper must be
submitted by email to: philip.j.magnotti@us.army.mil (NIPR) or
karen.m.amabile@us.army.mil (NIPR); karen.m.amabile@us.army.smil.mil (SIPR).
White papers must be submitted to Government POCs no later than 28 March
2012.  The subject of the mail message shall be:  Request for Information High
Efficiency Lethal Mechanisms (HELMech) to defeat Soft, Medium & Hard Targets,
Your Companys Name.

<DESC>The US ARMY Soldier Systems Center, Army Contracting Command, Natick, intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis with Empiristat Inc  under the  authority of  FAR Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a follow on effort to Contract W911QY-09-C-0104 that was competitively awarded in 2009. Unforeseen delays in FDA process have created delays that outlasted the originally awarded contract POP.  Empiristat, Inc. houses the subject matter expertise inherent to this program and particularly to data generated by the HOPSS study necessary to complete the FDA process without delay or increased cost to the government.  This sole source effort is to complete the process started under contract W911QY-09-C-0104.  Openly competing the contract requirements would require a new vendor at least 3-4 months in data transition and database re-development to come up to speed with current program requirements. This would negatively impact program progress and policy determinations which are awaiting results from this program.  In addition it would cost the Government approximately 500% more based on the Government's independent cost estimate to recomplete this effort and award to a new contractor.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Nathan.c.jordan@us.army.mil no later than 9:00 a.m. on March 13th 2012.

<DESC>The purpose of this Special Notice is to synopsize the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price bridge contract for the continuation of custodial services on a sole source basis to Koh Gumi &amp; Company.
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which DoDEA Pacific intends to solicit without providing for other than full and open competition under FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source as the unusual and compelling urgency of this requirement precludes competition to the maximum extent practical.</p>
<p>The current contract expires 31 March 2012. However, the anticipated award date for the new requirement is 1 October 2012, leaving a 6-month break in service. Therefore, a 6-month bridge contract is necessary to provide uninterrupted custodial services until the follow-on contract can be awarded. The anticipated award date for the bridge contract is 19 March 2012 with a period of performance from 1 April 2012 - 30 September 2012.</p>
<p>The proposed bridge contract action is for custodial services for DoDDS Okinawa Schools and Facilities; 13 schools and 2 office buildings.</p>

<CONTACT>Dewey A. Murdick, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-12-02@ugov.gov
<DESC>Synopsis <br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts/information should be included in the responses. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.
<p><br />Background &amp; Scope <br />This RFI seeks to determine the feasibility of significantly expanding current academic and industry efforts in automated legal text analysis and evidentiary reasoning. Compliance monitoring is the act of determining whether an entity's actions are consistent with the relevant constraints expressed in a collection of legal and regulatory documents. For example, determining whether a nation is compliant with international agreements regarding ocean fisheries to which it is a party may in part require comparing the catch limits articulated within international treaties and domestic regulations with the actual aggregate catch landed by vessels flagged to the nation in question. Assessing compliance on any single subject can require substantial resource and time investments. If compliance assessment is to be ongoing then these investments also must be sustained. The activities involved include: maintaining a deep understanding of the constraints represented by the dynamic overlapping set of multilingual agreements, laws and regulations, and assessing compliance using diverse imperfect data gathered from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Advances in several technical areas - including text analytics, natural language processing, evidentiary reasoning, rule discovery, knowledge discovery from large data sets, and machine learning - have the potential to make dramatic reductions in the resources and time needed to concurrently monitor compliance in multiple areas of interest. Multidisciplinary approaches to this challenge will come from multiple professions and academic fields.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should be as succinct as possible while providing specific information that addresses as many of the following questions as possible. Where available, please include citations in the published literature to supplement your responses.</p>
<p>1. What are current approaches to the automation of monitoring compliance with international laws, national regulations, and policies? Are there analogous challenges for which automated solutions exist that might be applied here? <br />2. Is the timing right to explore the automation of international law compliance monitoring? For example, is there a sufficient technology base that can be leveraged to accomplish these goals? Should only partial automation be considered?<br />3. How would you propose to address the activities of automated compliance monitoring? How would you enter the multilingual textual materials that together provide the constraints? How would you extract and reason about the constraints? How would you ingest data and assess compliance? What roles do you anticipate that people will play?<br />4. What are appropriate methods and metrics to measure performance of an automated compliance monitoring system? How would you test and monitor that such a system is working correctly? What performance goals will be acceptable to the stakeholders?<br />5. Are you aware of a particular domain that could be used as a test case? This domain would require sufficient data availability so that analytic systems could be thoroughly exercised and tested. All such data should be publically available.</p>
<p>The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a 1.5-day workshop on automated international law compliance monitoring. An expected result of such a workshop is the identification of promising areas for investment through vehicles such as seedlings, grand challenges, and programs. It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in the Washington, D.C. Metro Area in May or June of 2012. A separate workshop announcement will be posted with further details.</p>
<p>Preparation Instructions to Respondents<br />IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the U.S. Responses have the following formatting requirements:</p>
<p>A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-12-02:<br />1. A one-half page executive summary; <br />2. A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es); <br />3. A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached); <br />4. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas. <br />Submission Instructions to Respondents <br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on 10 April 2012. All submissions must be electronically submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-12-02@ugov.gov as a PDF document. Inquiries to this RFI must be submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-12-02@ugov.gov. Do not send questions with proprietary content. No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>Disclaimers and Important Notes <br />This is an RFI issued solely for information and new investment planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. It is the respondents' responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded whatever research is referred to in the response.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts/ information should be included in the submittal. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by IARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>

Title:  Fitch Solutions Subscription
Agency Contact Information:Acquisition Services DirectorateNational Business CenterDepartment of the Interior381 Elden Street, Suite 4000Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Fitch Solutions. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  
The Risk and Asset Management (RAM) branch of the Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) reviews and approves limits for foreign countries and foreign banks for the Commodity Credit Corporations export credit guarantee programs.  Given limited travel funds, RAM can do very little travel to any of the countries in which these banks are located.  Therefore, RAM uses reports generated by third parties such as Fitch Solutions Inc. as a source of current information about countries, banking systems and specific foreign banks throughout the world in order to conduct our financial analysis of these countries and foreign banks.  Fitch has offices in these countries and spends significant time with each rated foreign bank in order to do an in-depth analysis.  Fitch also does an analysis of the sovereign government and the banking system in these countries and RAM relies on all of these reports to conduct its own analysis in order to establish country and bank credit limits.  This subscription allows RAM access to the ongoing reviews and reports for 100 foreign banks (our current portfolio encompasses approximately 150 foreign banks), including the specific analyses of these banks and the countries in which they are located as well as their banking systems.  This service is used to enable RAM staff to fully identify and analyze the financial condition of foreign banks and U.S. banks that are granted credit limits or participate in CCCs export credit guarantee programs.  This is a proprietary, electronic analytical service available from one and only one source.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Fitch Solutions currently provides these types of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide these types of subscriptions.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement by the date specified herein.  The period of performance for this effort will be one year.  The Government will consider all capabilities statements received by 12pm EST, Friday, March 9 , 2012.  Please be advised that it is the offerors responsibility to assure the Government receives your submission on or before the specified due date.  Submissions shall be sent electronically to Michael McGuire, Contracting Officer at mike.mcguire@aqd.nbc.gov.
This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The Government reserves the right to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) as a result of this announcement.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice that will be posted for this acquisition, based on the review of any responses to this notice.

Title:  Bureau Van Dijks electronic Bankscope subscription
Agency Contact Information:Acquisition Services DirectorateNational Business CenterDepartment of the Interior381 Elden Street, Suite 4000Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  
The Risk and Asset Management (RAM) branch of the Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS) reviews and approves limits for foreign countries and foreign banks for the Commodity Credit Corporations (CCC) export credit guarantee programs.  Given limited travel funds, RAM can do very little travel to any of the countries in which these banks are located.  Therefore, RAM uses reports generated by third parties such as Bureau Van Dijks Bankscope as a source of current information about specific foreign banks throughout the world in order to conduct our financial analyses of these foreign banks.  This service is used to enable RAM staff to fully identify and analyze the financial condition of foreign banks and U.S. banks that are granted credit limits or participate in CCCs export credit guarantee programs.
Bureau Van Dijks Bankscope is the largest database provider of bank financial statements and the only reputable vendor of this product which RAM requires in order to complete its mission.  Bureau Van Dijk provides financial statements, financial ratios, ownership (parent and subsidiary) information as well as external rating agency country and bank-specific ratings which allows RAM to conduct its financial analyses in a timely and efficient manner.  This subscription allows all RAM analysts to access and manipulate a comprehensive global database containing information on over 29,000 public and private banks throughout the world, including 16 years of detailed accounts, ratios, ratings and ownership information.  This database allows RAM to fill the analysis gap when we do not have access to a banks financial statements or its financial ratios.  It also permits RAM to produce a comparative analysis between a bank and its peer group within a country without the time and expense of visiting the banks.  This service is deemed available only from this source and is considered a proprietary electronic analytical service.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing currently provides these types of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide these types of subscriptions.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement by the date specified herein.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Max Dolinsky and Associates, Potomac, MD, for the purchase of Chemical Database Editor (CHED) Network License Updates and Maintenance of the License.
<p>NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.</p>
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>Sole Source determination is based on the following: The Chemical and Biochemical Reference Data Division at NIST currently uses a proprietary Chemical Editor (CHED) software which is integrated with the NIST Mass Spectral software systems and actively used in the workflow. The software is used by the NIST mass spectrometry data center in building NIST Mass Spectral Library and GC Retention Index Database. The NIST mass spectral archive editing system is constantly in the process of further development. Therefore, NIST requires updates and maintenance for the CHED software. These updates and maintenance must maintain compatibility with the existing software.</p>
<p>Max Dolinsky and Associates is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the software that is required to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511, and the size standard is $25M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 13, 2012, 3:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>MINORITY INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION<br />&amp; MINORITY-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS</p>
<p>Government Contracting Workshop<br /><br />ABOUT THIS WORKSHOP<br />The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) provides information for organizations interested in doing business with the Federal Government. A series of government contracting (govcon) workshops are being held in a variety of locations throughout the United States to provide information to Minority Institutions of Higher Education (MIHE) staff and Minority Owned Small Business (MOSB) representatives to 1) become familiar with processes and procedures associated with federal government contracting; and 2) to identify and pursue contract opportunities with HHS. The objective of these workshops is to engage, equip and inform the MIHE and MOSB participants of the federal procurement process so that they become more effective in pursuing contracting opportunities at HHS.</p>
<p><strong>COST</strong>: FREE</p>
<p><strong>WORKSHOP DATE &amp; LOCATION<br /></strong>March 27-28, 2012 Miami Dade College, Miami, FL</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION/REGISTRATION<br /></strong>For more information and to register, visit http://fedgovconworkshops.com/miami-fl-workshop/. For businesses, there is a limit of 2 representatives per company per workshop.</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding the event, please contact us at fedgovconworkshops@d2dinc.com.<br /><br /><strong>AGENDA<br /></strong>The synopsis of the agenda is below. The full agenda is available on the website.</p>
<p><strong>Day One<br /></strong>&bull; Introduction to Government Contracting<br />&bull; Understanding Procurement Methods<br />&bull; The Government's Internal Process<br />&bull; Small Business Classifications &amp; Certification Programs<br />&bull; Guest Speaker<br />&bull; Other Business Opportunities<br />&bull; Marketing to the Government &amp; HHS<br /><br /><strong>Day Two<br /></strong>&bull; Introduction to FAR and Compliance Issues<br />&bull; Contract Pricing &amp; Cost Proposals<br />&bull; Guest Speaker<br />&bull; Technical Proposals</p>
<p><strong>WHO SHOULD ATTEND?<br /></strong>MOSBs and MIHEs that are interested in pursuing government contracts or who have initiated the process, but have not yet been successful should attend a workshop. This includes business owners, MIHE faculty and staff.</p>
<p>I work for a MIHE. Why Should I Attend?<br />In this economy, Institutions need additional sources of funding. The Federal Government is an excellent resource to fund and get grants for research projects. MIHE faculty and staff should attend a workshop so they understand the government contracting environment and have the tools necessary to navigate the government processes.</p>
<p>This is a Two-Day Event. I'm a Teacher and Can't Afford to Miss Classes.<br />We understand that class schedules may overlap with the workshop schedule. There is no requirement to attend the entire workshop. Come to the session(s) that are convenient for your schedule.</p>
<p>I already know the basics of government contracting. How will this workshop help me?<br />You may be familiar with the basics; however this workshop will delve deeper. You will also gain insight about the proposal development process, which will position you to submit compliant proposals.</p>

<DESC>The Central Receiving Office within the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) intends to ask a DOT Contracting Officer to exercise Option Year FY 2012 as set forth in Line Item No. 0003 and in Line Item No. 0004 of DOT's existing Purchase Order No. DTOS59-10-P-00176.&nbsp; Each of those Line Items has a value of $23,287.50, so the aggregate combined value of the contemplated Option-exercising is $46,575.&nbsp; Line Item No. 0003 calls for the existing contractor, Symplicity Corporation, to provide, to DOT, hosting and maintenance for a Transportation Integrated Printing Tracking System (TIPTS) for a one-year period; and Line Item No. 0004 calls for Symplicity to provide, to DOT, technical support for the TIPTS system for a one-year period.&nbsp;&nbsp; DOT believes that the exercising of that Option Year FY 2012, under that existing Symplicity Purchase Order No. DTOS59-10-P-00176, would be the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government's need, price and other factors considered, as required by section 17.207 (c) (3) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).&nbsp; Nevertheless, DOT is publishing this Special Notice in order to satisfy the FAR's requirement that the Option be synopsized. Therefore, notwithstanding DOT's plan to fulfill its need by simply exercising the Option, any interested person or organization (other than Symplicity) may e-mail, to <a href="mailto:james.mowery@dot.gov">james.mowery@dot.gov</a> and to <a href="mailto:Leisca.White@dot.gov">Leisca.White@dot.gov</a>, by 11:59 PM March 16, 2012, a Statement of Qualifications and a Cost Proposal attempting to prove that the submitter can fulfill the Government's need more advantageously than could Symplicity, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for commercially available items. Only one responsible source is reasonably available due to the fact that Philips Healthcare, a division of Philips Electronics North America Corporation, is the only manufacturer and retailer for this proprietary equipment.<br><br>Currently the XXth Medical Group is using existing Philips hardware and software. This vendor is the original equipment manufacturer and the only source that can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources (e.g. unique features, function of the item, direct replacement parts/components for existing equipment, patent, copyright and proprietary data).<br><br>The procurement of the Philips C10-3v Purewave Broadband Transducer (2 ea.) and the L17-5 Broadband Linear Array Transducer (1 ea.) will significantly increase imaging clarity, decrease the number of repeat examinations, decrease exam time thereby increasing patient throughput and improve diagnostic accuracy of the interpreting radiologist. The purchase of the C10-3v transducers will replace existing C8-4v transducers and will better interface with the Vision software upgrade and optimize imaging. The L17-5 transducer will broaden the scope of exams available and will improve the musculoskeletal, breast and superficial ultraOlmd imaging.<br><br>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334510 and the size standard is 500 employees. All responsible sources may submit a response. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the Quoting Contractor(s) to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.
 Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a contractor(s) quote(s) to not be accepted by the Government. 

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items

NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation. In addition, Quoting Contractors are instructed to complete and submit the attached past performance survey (found on the NECO site) with submitted quotes prior to the closing date of this notice specified herein. 

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a) The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes. 

(i) CAPABILITY TO PERFORM
(ii) PAST PERFORMANCE
(ii) PRICE

(b) Only those Quoting Contractors which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii). In the second step of evaluating quotes determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE. 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with Quoting Contractors. Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
 

(c) By submitting a signed quote under this solicitation, Contractor asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract. The contracting officer will validate contractors technical capability to perform by verifying that the contractor that supplied a quote has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract. TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria. Under this factor, contractors will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
 

(d) Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor supplying a quote has a satisfactory record of past performance. Contractors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years with submitted quotes. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation (posted on the NECO site). Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

A quoting Contractor which lacks relevant past performance history will receive a NEUTRAL rating for this factor.
 Any Quoting Contractor which has no relevant past performance history, while rated NEUTRAL, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the other quotes received.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Quoting Contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting Contractor s past performance.

SATISFACTORY: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Quoting Contractor s past performance.

MARGINAL: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Quoting Contractor s past performance.


(f) A written notice of award otherwise furnished to the successful Quoting Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order without further action by either party.
 Before the quotes specified expiration time, the Government may place a purchase order, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Introduction: USAID Uganda seeks to hire a qualified individual to serve as NUDEIL Program Manager responsible<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"> </span>for the implementation of the NUDEIL Program.&nbsp;Located in Gulu; the contractor reports to the Northern Uganda Team Leader in charge of the Mission's field office.&nbsp; The head of the field office in turn reports to the Deputy Mission Director in Kampala.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition to this supervisory reporting relationship, the NUDEIL Program Manager works across the Mission's Development Objective teams to help coordinate and facilitate the integration of and reporting on NUDEIL activities into the Mission's broader portfolio and enhance programs aimed at stabilization and reconstruction in northern Uganda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Program Manager, the contractor is responsible for building a positive relationship with, and facilitating the work of, each District Administration participating in NUDEIL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>S/he ensures that the NUDEIL Operating Plan between the District and USAID is adhered to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>S/he will supervise the USAID support contractor, ensuring that it is facilitating District efforts on the one hand, while maintaining priority on its monitoring and oversight responsibilities for the design, procurement and construction of infrastructure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>S/he leads the effort to design and implement the Joint Results Management Framework, liaising with USAID/Uganda, the District Administration, and the USAID contractor to ensure that the resulting plan is achievable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>S/he will also lead the Joint Results Management Committees that oversee the program at the district level and at the central government level.<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The position involves providing expert analytical, advisory, and implementation support for the execution of a major USAID program within a broad and complex geographic area and across technical specialty areas.&nbsp; The contractor should understand how small infrastructure construction programs are managed and how technical and programmatic issues can be resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>S/he must have experience actively managing a large program for results and be prepared to report regularly on the activities and progress related to the program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>S/he should have budget management experience and be prepared to understand the major issues associated with cash transfer-based assistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior experience working with citizens at the community level and local governments is preferred and will help the candidate succeed in the program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ability to multi-task and work across different agencies and technical areas is essential.&nbsp; In the context of Gulu, where many donors, international organizations and contractors are present, the incumbent serves as a catalyst for effective aid approaches, including facilitating and coordinating joint donor programming exercises for small infrastructure, for example, when the District government requires assistance in this area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the surface, the basic tenets of the position are contradictory - the Program Manager has to build rapport with the District Administration to facilitate program implementation while at the same time serve as the person who reports up-front to the District Administration when problems arise and be part of a review that could postpone needed resource transfers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Program Manager has primary program management responsibilities including supervising the USAID support contractor, ensuring that it carries through with the same sense of mutual responsibility for success that the District and USAID have.&nbsp; A strong sense of judgment, organization and program management skills are required.&nbsp; As part of this, the contractor must be able to rapidly identify and anticipate problem issues, help formulate strategic and programming priorities, and write under tight deadlines to produce widely disseminated products that assess complex issues and propose workable solutions.&nbsp; The work requires an extremely positive and outgoing personality, the ability to propose options and solutions to problems, and flexibility to address the challenges of working in a post-conflict environment.&nbsp; Furthermore, the ability to brief a variety of audiences on the program activities - including senior US Government officials, Ugandan government officials, and other donors requires strong oral and written communication skills.&nbsp; Collaboration with other offices, bureaus and agencies within and outside of the USG is also important to this position. Contacts are with Department of State and USAID employees at all levels; GOU officials, United Nations (UN) staff; representatives of other donor governments, and officials of non-governmental organizations.&nbsp; The Program Manager participates in open meetings and conferences where s/he may be called upon to explain and defend USAID activities/approaches with regard to the NUDEIL program.&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Specific duties and responsibilities: </span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">1. Serve as the USAID Program Manager for the NUDEIL program and Contracting Officer's Representative for the USAID support contractor selected to support the implementation of the NUDEIL program which will be responsible for quality control on all project activities and support for the District Engineering Office(s) in a timely manner; designs are prepared for tendering in accordance with the highest standards; the procurement and contracting process is completed according to Ugandan Law and Regulations; that</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">monitoring and oversight of works is done on a regular basis sufficient to identify and correct deficiencies in a timely manner; environmental compliance actions are undertaken and completed as required;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that payments are made in a timely manner and that the system for payment certification by the USAID support contractor is operating for all payments made.&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Supervise the implementation of the NUDEIL Operational Plan (NOP) between USAID and each District Administration participating in the program.&nbsp; The NOP covers: the responsibilities of the parties; the roles and responsibilities of the USAID support contractor; the process for certifying infrastructure completion, the process for monitoring infrastructure works, the process for payment of construction contracts - including the role of the USAID contractor, and the role of the District audit authority and an audit plan.&nbsp; The NOP also includes a detailed outline of the process of identifying, designing, procuring, completing, and paying infrastructure contracts with time lines for each action in the process.&nbsp;3. Supervise the development and implementation of a Joint Results Management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The JRMF identifies time periods and program results milestones to be achieved during each time period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The milestones associated with each time frame are associated with a level of incremental funding: i.e., if the milestones are reached, the additional funding will be released to continue the program.&nbsp; The milestone and the funding levels have to be designed such that, assuming smooth execution of contracts, the program can move seamlessly forward, without starts and stops due to funding shortfalls. 4. Ensure the smooth flow of funds from NUDEIL accounts in the Federal Reserve to the Bank of Uganda and District bank accounts.&nbsp; NUDEIL is a non-project assistance program managed jointly with the GOU, especially at the District level.&nbsp; Therefore, the mechanism to be used for joint USAID-GOU management will be the Implementation Letter. The contractor will be responsible for initiating - or drafting - most of the program implementation letters issued under the NUDEIL program.&nbsp;5. Liaise regularly with Kampala-based staff to ensure that NUDEIL-related issues are resolved on a timely basis. 6. Liaise with central government officials participating in the Joint Results Management Committee, including but not limited to Ministry of Finance, Bank of Uganda, and Ministry of Local Government. 7. Travel throughout the northern districts to monitor the effectiveness and progress of NUDEIL rehabilitation activities, liaising with local populace to independently identify and assess issues. 8. Represent USAID (and on occasion the USG) in appropriate district sector, sub sector and working group meetings, as well as other meetings of USAID interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>May serve as acting Team Leader on occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Manage and supervise two support staff and liaise with other Gulu staff and programs. 10. Prepare input for weekly reports to the Northern Uganda Team Leader. The report should summarize progress and issues encountered in NUDEIL implementation; report on relevant meetings, conversations and visits; and provide field analysis and insights into key areas of USAID concern. The contractor will report directly to the Northern Uganda Team Leader, and through him/her to the USAID/Uganda Deputy Mission Director or designee.

<p>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition<br />There are many network software companies that offer network monitoring software. However, we have identified that Network Analyzer Software is the best tool.</p>
<p>(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the<br />document as a Justification for other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Command, Control, &amp; Communications<br />Engineering Center (C3CEN), Portsmouth, VA.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>Purchase of Netflow Analyzer Software Enterprise Edition as part of the process for developing web services application for SAROPS. The project requires the ability to analyze the bandwidth used on CGDN and minimize the impact to other network traffic. TISCOM Approved Waiver#: 2012-TIS-645</p>
<p>(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's<br />needs. <br /><br />Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS) is the Coast Guard's Mission Essential Application (MEA) for use as a Search and Rescue tool. It is currently deployed as a Terminal Server (TS) application residing on a number of distributed terminal servers. SAROPS has been in service in its current configuration since 2004 and the currently deployed version is 1.3. As technology advances, so does the need for the CG to evolve its MEAs to continue to meet current and future needs. As a TS application, SAROPS is dependent on locally installed supporting applications (such as ESRI ArcDesktop). The next generation of SAROPS is planned as a Web Service (WS) application that can be accessed and run from the internet browser of any computer or mobile devices. To accomplish this, the existing equipment will be eventually replaced with web servers.</p>
<p>There will be multiple data centers to house these web servers. We need a network monitoring software that could do the tasks listed in the table below. There are many network software companies that offer network monitoring software. However, we have identified that Network Analyzer Software is the best tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This software is the approved software for use on CG One.</p>
<p><br />Features required for System Monitoring Tool Netflow Analyzer by <br />Zoho Corporation<br />Measure data throughput <br />Identify traffic flow <br />Capture network related statistics:<br />- Bandwidth<br />- Throughput<br />- Bandwidth utilization<br />- Offered load<br />- Accuracy<br />- Efficiency<br />- Delay (latency) and delay variation<br />- Response time <br />Application Monitoring:<br />- Number of users<br />- Number of sessions per user-day<br />- Average duration of session<br />- Average number of simultaneous sessions<br />- Peak data rate Burst Duration Busy period<br />- Mean data rate<br />- Min data rate<br />- Multi-cast, etc.</p>
<p><br />Total Estimated Value: $10,000.00</p>
<p><br />(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>6.302-1(c), Application for brand name descriptions. An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. It shall be justified and approved IAW FAR 6.303 and 6.304.</p>
<p>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br /><br />As project engineer, I know there are numerous manufacturers of network analyzers that may meet the project requirements. Without seeking approval for other manufactures/models we are constrained to the currently approved items. In the past the project has sought waivers to connect non-standard equipment to the CGDN+. We were required to provide three units of the desired equipment to TISCOM for evaluation (to be retained at TISCOM and not to be returned). We provided over $100K of servers for this certification and were required to wait for such before deployment. The project does not have the luxury of time or resources for this purchase and wish to proceed with standard item procurement.</p>
<p>This procurement is for a "Named Brand" product, which under the requirements of 6.302-1(b) requires a justification for other than "full and open competition" even though this product is available from multiple sources. As indicated, in the past the project has sought certification and/or waivers for non-standard products. If those products connect to the CGDN+, certification/waiver is time consuming and could be expensive. While other manufacturer switches may be evaluated and subsequently approved for installation on CGDN+, this too would require additional time and resources. Though not precisely calculable, estimates for this effort range from $50K and 6 months - upwards. Though C3CEN may submit a request to the network authority for this evaluation and approval, it is outside the scope of C3CEN authority to perform the evaluation. There are many network software companies that offer network monitoring software. However, we have identified that Network Analyzer Software is the best tool. This software is only manufactured by ZOHO Corporation.<br /><br />(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.</p>
<p>RFP will be posted on FEDBIZOPS with statement that any Contractor that feels that they can<br />provide these Supplies or Services as listed may provide a Quotation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(7) A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Market research revealed there are other sources that provide this name brand product</p>
<p>(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted and the contractor's found in item 10 expressed an interest by providing pricing during that time.</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:</p>
<p>None at this time.<br /><br />(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an <br />interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>SHI International Corporation, Dallas TX<br />Insight Public Sector, Liberty Lake, WA</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove<br />or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent<br />acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>None at this time.</p>
<p>(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate <br />and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge<br />and belief.</p>
<p>This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and<br />belief. The anticipated cost to the Government is determined to be fair and<br />reasonable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James A. Lassiter, <br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p><br />I certify this procurement meets the Governments minimum need and that the <br />supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and<br />accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>PERIOD OF ACCEPTANCE OF OFFERS: The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>LATE OFFERS: Quotations or modification of quotes received at the address specified for the receipt of offers after the exact time specified for receipt of offers WILL NOT be considered.</p>
<p>EVALUATION/AWARD:</p>
<p>(1) Award will be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offer. Award will be made to the acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated cost or price, meeting or exceeding the acceptability of standards for non-cost factors, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements.<br />(2) Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices if applicable. The price quotation will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the pricing schedule by the unit price for each Contract Line Items Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount of each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price.<br />(3) Once the offers are ranked by price, the government will start with the lowest price offer to evaluate technical acceptability of each named "candidate".

In order to be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must submit qualifying documentation demonstrating the candidate has at least one year of current experience in A+, Network+, and Security+. "Current" experience is defined as any experience within the past five years.<br />(4) If the lowest priced offer is determined to be technically acceptable, that offer represents the best value to the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offer is not judged to be technically acceptable, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offer is judged to be technically acceptable or until all offers are evaluated. The Contracting Officer shall then make a best value award decision.</p>

The shelving shall include complete back and side panels on each fixture, a digital keypad access system, and motorized movement. A ceiling and a floor are not necessary and neither are doors.</p>
<p>The digital keypad shall be programmed so each user enters their personal code and the unit will automatically open the fixture that way it can be tracked who the last person to access the equipment stored in each fixture was. It will not interface with any existing security systems. There shall be one key pad per shelving&nbsp;fixture and they shall be programmed so each authorized person will have one code assigned per person that will grant them access to all units but no more than one unit can be open at a time. There shall be codes for up to 200 people as well as a safety mechanism so a person cannot be crushed between the units when closing (not a counter).<br /><br />The first&nbsp;fixture will remain stationary but must still be on the track to match height, all others must be mobile.

<p>CORRRECTION: The requested mobile storage&nbsp;system will entirely replace the existing&nbsp;stationary storage fixtures. All fixtures except for the first fixture, will be motorized on an above ground track which will be installed on the existing concrete floor.

Anchors shall be no larger than &frac14; in. x 2 in.</p>
<p>The &nbsp;fixtures being replaced are shown in the pictures posted. Our own personnel will be removing these fixtures. Therefore, removal shall not be included in this buy.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Products &amp; Performance Required- CLARIFICATION<br /><br /></span></strong>The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Offices (MMESO) has received several questions from vendors on the estimated annual dollar requirement of $10,358,864.65 as posted in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO)ME-1108-55 Mask Particulate Respirator (N95).The Mask Particulate Respirator (N95) product line has the potential to see large swings in usage based upon pandemic events, establishment and maintaining stockpiles of personal protective equipment(PPE), humanitarian aid and funding. The MMESO reviewed two separate usage data sets and both usage data sets contained large volumes of purchases within this product line during the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2010 and first quarter FY 2011. This purchasing pattern has repeated for the last two years but, for the reason stated above may not follow the same pattern in the future. If fluctuations in procurement are not included in annual volume, remaining procurement was historically in the vicinity of $800K during the 12-month period. Your response to the FBO should take into account these factors. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact the MMESO.</p>

<p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to the following questions posed by potential offerors:</p>
<p>Part of Task 4 in the PWS states the following "...present the paper at the ASME 2012 International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference from June 3 to 8, 2012 in Notre Dame, Indiana. ..."</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions regarding this part of task 4 as follows.<br />1) ASME 2012 requires that an abstract be submitted by November 25, 2011. Has this abstract been submitted? If so, can a copy of it be made available?<br />2) As per ASME 2012, the deadline for submission of Final Paper is March 5, 2012. Is the contractor expected to have a final paper ready by March 5, 2012?</p>
<p>Response: <br />Please see the attached revised PWS, which removes this task from the requirements (see deleted text on task 4 and deliverable 4 in the attached PWS).</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334611 and the size standard is 500.00 employees. This is a Request for Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is HSHQDC-12-P-00052.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the government to award a Firm Fixed Price contract from this solicitation. All interested parties must quote on all items. Award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable, responsible quoter. To be technically acceptable, the items being quoted must meet or exceed the salient characteristics listed in the requirements below.</p>
<p>(a) Requirement.<br />The Department of Homeland Security has a requirement for an analytic tool for scheduled flight data so that I&amp;A analysts can track trends and changes in commercial airline schedules, routes, frequencies and capacity for the past twelve (12) months.<br /><br />1.0 BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The mission of the Office of Intelligence &amp; Analysis Homeland Counterterrorism Division's Terrorist Travel and Immigration Branch (TTISB) includes analyzing valid and complete airline scheduled flights to identify trends and patterns related to aviation security and the DHS counterterrorism mission. To that end, the TTISB requires a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software tool (one user). The COTS software tool will provide all worldwide air travel schedules and the functionality to customize queries so as to facilitate the analysis of these data to make them relevant to the DHS aviation security and counterterrorism mission.</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>Intelligence and Analysis's (I&amp;A) objective is to obtain an analytic software tool for scheduled flight data so that I&amp;A analysts can track trends and changes in commercial airline schedules, routes, frequencies and capacity for the current month beginning February 2012, eleven months in the future, and thirteen months historical.</p>
<p>3.0 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: (N/A)</p>
<p>4.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The period of performance will start on or about 28 February, 2012 with the base period of performance for twelve (12) months and two (2) one-year option periods thereafter:</p>
<p>Base Year: 28 February 2012 - 27 February 2013<br />Option 1: 28 February 2013 - 27 February 2014<br />Option 2: 28 February 2014 - 27 February 2015</p>
<p>Note: These dates are only estimates. The base year period of performance will start at the date of award.</p>
<p>5.0 SCOPE OF WORK:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide historical scheduled flight data refreshed online or on CD as well as analytic tools to process the data and draw conclusions relevant to I&amp;A's mission. The flight data must be user friendly and designed to allow users to manipulate the scheduled flight data and easily draw conclusions from an analytic platform. The contractor will provide an online or CD flight data subscription that is all inclusive of the following:</p>
<p>5.1. Includes software and data with monthly CD updates for one user</p>
<p>5.2. Includes a custom search with the flexibility to include search criteria for the available fields in the data set. <br />5.3. Includes commercially reasonable efforts via extensive quality control procedures to verify the accuracy of the data received from the airline supplying the information before the data are published in the database.</p>
<p>5.4. Includes a tool that is able to display only one record for a code share flight, but retains the capability to see the other flight numbers if the user chooses to do so.</p>
<p>5.5. Includes commercially reasonable efforts used via extensive quality control procedures to verify the accuracy of airline names and codes and airport codes, as well as the completeness of airlines included in the database, including new and low volume foreign airlines.</p>
<p>5.6. Includes a tool that allows scheduled flight data to be pulled by day, by week, by month, and by year.</p>
<p>5.7. Includes real-time customer support during business hours and therefore requires multiple fallback levels of customer support.</p>
<p>5.8. Includes user guide or help functionality for the software tool to enable self-education on the tool's functionality and resolve technical problems if an issue occurs when customer support is unavailable.</p>
<p>5.9. Includes an export capability into Excel format</p>
<p>5.10. Includes providing data at the date of delivery in order for the Government to support a mission critical initiative. In light of this short time frame, the Government does not require software to be authorized for use on DHS computers, as the Government maintains a standalone computer with no software restrictions on which data can be uploaded by CD.</p>
<p>5.11. Includes historical scheduled flight data for the current month beginning (28 February 2012), eleven months in the future (data through 27 January 2013), and thirteen months of historical data (28 February 2012 - 27 January 2011).</p>
<p>5.12. Provide a monthly update, with the first update starting March 2012 The updates will include the month the updated data are delivered, eleven (11) months in the future from the date that data are updated, and thirteen (13) months historical data from the date the data are updated.</p>
<p>5.13. Includes publicly available training schedule from the source company on how to use the tool.</p>
<p>6.0 DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>6.1. Scheduled flight data and analytic tool on CD due at contract award</p>
<p>6.2. Monthly scheduled flight data updates on CD are due in the first five days of each month</p>
<p>6.3. User Guide due 24 hours after contract award</p>
<p>6.4. List of publicly available training and an outline of the training that is available 30 days after contract award</p>
<p>6.5. All invoices will be submitted to the designated Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) by the 15th of each month. Invoicing information will be provided upon contract award.</p>
<p>7.0 WARRANTY AVAILABILITY</p>
<p>7.1. No warranty is known to be available for this type of software, although the Government does require customer support in the event that issues with the software emerge.</p>
<p>8.0 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>8.1. All data received on a CD must meet the mandatory requirements and would be authorized for use on the Government's standalone computer.</p>
<p>8.2. All data versions must be compatible with Windows XP and newer operating systems</p>
<p>8.3. Shipping and Handling will be charged separately for monthly CD updates.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong> The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the Government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330 and 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. <strong>(NOTE: Effective 12 March 2012, the size standard will be $14.0M for NAICS code 541330.)</strong> The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) contracts to large and small businesses. In addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts, we are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for Continental United States (CONUS) (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services) will be similar for all contracts. The type of projects/programs for the worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects. The type of projects/programs for the regional suites will include SRM projects.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) contracts to small businesses. The scope of A-E services will include Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services. The types of projects/programs will include Environmental Remediation, Environmental Compliance (EC), and Environmental Quality (EQ) projects. Work will be performed primarily in CONUS. There may be a small amount of OCONUS work anticipated.</p>
<p>All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with two additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a>).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.</strong> These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts.

<p><strong>Request comment from interested parties to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p>1. What are your thoughts about separating the A-E requirements into two separate contracts, Environmental Remediation (NAICS 562910) and Engineering Services (541330)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) only (questions 2 &amp;3)</span></strong></p>
<p>2. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about setting aside all environmental remediation requirements to small business?</p>
<p>3. What is your business size? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) only (questions 4-6)</span></strong></p>
<p>4. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about reserving all of the CONUS regional contracts for small business?</p>
<p>5. As previously noted, some CONUS projects may be issued against the worldwide contracts. What would your recommended project parameters include (i.e. "X" dollar value, "X" project type) to move a requirement from a regional CONUS contract to the worldwide contract?</p>
<p>6. There is a potential to establish only three regions (i.e. East, West and Central) for the CONUS Engineering Services efforts. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about your firm's capacity to cover large CONUS regions?</p>
<p>7. Do you have any other comments or suggestions that you would like to share with us?</p>

<DESC><strong>ATTENTION ALL INTERESTED PARTIES/OFFERORS:</strong>
<p><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is soliciting comments, suggestions and industry feedback regarding <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Ginnie Mae's Manufactured Housing Master Subservicer I </strong>requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>HUD intends to satisfy its requirements through the use of a SOW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW), links are provided to access the Single Family Issuer Requirements and Mortgaged-Backed Securities Guide 5500.3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;It is anticipated that this requirement will result in a competitive procurement under the 8(A) program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, in order to compete for the <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Ginnie Mae Manufactured Housing Master Subservicer I (MH MSS I) </strong>contract, the Contractor must be an approved Ginnie Mae Single Family Issuer. The Issuer must be an approved FHA Title I mortgagee in good standing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The requirements to become a Ginnie Mae Single Family Issuer are stated in the Ginnie Mae MBS Guide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <strong>However, Ginnie Mae reserves the right to waive the networth and liquidity requirements for being a Ginnie Mae Issuer at its discretion.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The resultant solicitation that HUD anticipates releasing this fiscal year will require that offerors that are awarded Ginnie Mae's Master Subservicer contract must have the ability to service a defaulted manufactured housing MBS portfolio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contractors(s)' servicing would encompass but are not limited to the ability to service retail installment contracts (RICs)/loans in various stages of default in the FHA program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contractor must understand the specific program requirements outlined in the Ginnie Mae's Mortgage-Backed Securities Guide 5500.3 (Ginnie Mae Guide) and be able to fulfill the monthly reporting requirements and continue to comply with all requirements referred to Issuer eligibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;HUD welcomes all questions, concerns, clarifications and any other input that would assist in developing this requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Industry input is sought in order to make the SOW as complete, accurate, understandable and achievable as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The following documents are provided for industry review and comments:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>draft SOW, links to the Ginnie Mae Single Family Issuer Requirements. Please review the aforementioned documents and submit your firm's capabilities to fulfill the potential requirement as an 8(a) firm as well as all comments, suggestions and feedback to the following address:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Gina.E.Lassiter@hud.gov<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">, </span>by</strong> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Tuesday<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">, March 6, 2012 at 11:00am.</span></strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Annual posting of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)
<SOLNBR>HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<CONTACT>Kristina L. Parmenter, Contract Specialist, Phone 256-450-4679, Email kristina.parmenter@mda.mil - Janice S Olson, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-450-4330, Email janice.olson@mda.mil
<DESC><p>Amendment 02 serves as the annual posting of this Broad Agency Announcement in accordance with FAR 35.016 (c).</p>
<p>Amendment 01 posted on 15 August 2011 updated contact information for the Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p>Introduction:<br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack. The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase. MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries. MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.</p>
<p>Technical advancement is essential for continuous improvement in the BMDS. MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term. The MDA Director, Advanced Technology (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.</p>
<p>MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Program to identify and develop innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS. ATI is a competitive, science and technology research program, which consists of forefront advanced research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." Any contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).</p>
<p>The MDA contracts with private industry, qualified accredited domestic educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations for research in those areas covered in this BAA. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract, though the government reserves the right to use other types of contractual instruments if they are deemed more appropriate for the proposed work. MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards, however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle. Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Richard Schwarz, MDA/DVR; 256-450-4366, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a concept paper or proposal in response to this BAA. Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported. Cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) type contracts are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts. Any awards are anticipated to occur in fiscal year (FY) 2012 through FY 2013.</p>
<p>Research Topics:<br />MDA/DV is interested in development of advanced technology research in technologies for each missile defense phase encompassing the entire engagement sequence to include Surveillance, Acquisition and Tracking, Discrimination, Communications, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, Evolving Threats and Countermeasures, and Kill Assessment. The following nine ATI research topic areas pertain to the BMDS in all phases of the missile defense threat scenario:</p>
<p>(1) Radar Systems</p>
<p>(2) Lasers and Electro-optical Systems</p>
<p>(3) Sensor Systems</p>
<p>(4) Computer, Signal and Data Processing</p>
<p>(5) Materials and Electronics</p>
<p>(6) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</p>
<p>(7) Battle Management/Command and Control</p>
<p>(8) Propulsion and Power Systems</p>
<p>(9) Modeling and Simulation</p>
<p>(10) International BMDS Cooperation: Proposals for International BMDS Cooperation (area 10) must contain direct work relating to a foreign company or university that is either a partner or major subcontract under the proposed effort. This is the only area that we will entertain accepting basic or applied research proposals.</p>
<p>Note: The Government reserves the right to release additional or supplemental requests for information on any of the above listed topics through FedBizOps to evaluate and consider along with white paper submissions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following:</p>
<p>(1) A summary concept white paper (no more than ten pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program using the attached Proposal Instructions (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(2) White Paper Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM), using the attached Cost Proposal Instructions paragraph (5).</p>
<p>(3) A suggested program plan using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4)(d).</p>
<p>(4) A description of the offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4)(e).</p>
<p>Note: Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete. If selected for award MDA will request a full technical volume and detailed cost proposal as requested in the attached proposal instructions paragraphs (6) (7) and (8). DO NOT SUBMIT THE TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THIS INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offeror's acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.</p>
<p>The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e). The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows:</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS: <br />MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation:</p>
<p>(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness;</p>
<p>(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives;</p>
<p>(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel which are critical in achieving the proposal objectives;</p>
<p>(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; and</p>
<p>(5) Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.</p>
<p>Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offeror's proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: <br />The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offeror's proposal:</p>
<p>(1) The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application;</p>
<p>(2) The offerors' capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities;</p>
<p>(3) The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; and</p>
<p>(4) Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of advanced technology for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution. White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive. This BAA will remain open until March 1, 2013. Submittals will continue to be accepted after initial posting date throughout the entire period of time the BAA is open.</p>
<p>Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).</p>

A contract may not be awarded as a result of this announcement. <br><br>The purpose of this 'Sources Sought/Market Survey' is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and to develop additional knowledge of the existing market for the required services. Feedback on individual submissions will not be provided. <br><br>Capability Packages:<br><br>Small businesses are encouraged to submit capability packages; however, the size of this acquisition is anticipated to exceed the established small business size threshold for the NAICS codes determined to be appropriate for this requirement.  Interested small business concerns that are qualified as a HUBZone, or other small business categories in NAICS code 541611 with a size standard of $7,000,000.00 are encouraged to submit their capability packages.  The Government reserves the right to reserve any portion of this requirement for Small Business Concerns and will maintain a list of interested and qualified entities.<br><br>Businesses having the ability to provide the services listed in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement shall provide clear and comprehensive information supporting their experience, expertise, and current company profile to include the number of employees, office location(s), DUNS number, CAGE code, small business designation/status claimed and annual revenue. Furthermore, responses should identify the specific task areas in Section 5.0 that the organization is capable of performing. The capability packages for this 'sources sought/market survey' are not expected to be proposals, but rather statements regarding the company's existing experience in relation to the areas specified in the PWS.   <br><br><br>Capability Packages should clearly address the following areas:<br><br>1. Technical understanding of the work: The National Guard Bureau (NGB), the representative agency for the National Guard (NG), a reserve component of the U.S Department of Defense (DOD) has the urgent need to provide mental health support services per provision 10 U.S.C., Chapter 55; Section 723, National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007, Pub. L. 109-163 and the Report of the DOD Task Force on Mental Health (TFMH), June 2007, specifically behavioral health and support services for NG Service Members as part of pre-deployment resiliency training and post deployment reintegration to civilian life.10 U.S.C., Chapter 55 establishes: federal responsibility for Prevention, Mitigation, and Treatment of Blast Injuries (Pub. L. 109-163 (1) (D); Access to Health Care Services for Beneficiaries Eligible for TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care (Pub. L. 107-314, (A), (C); Health Care Management Demonstration Program (Pub. L. 106-398, (a), (b, 1-2),  specifically to improve, develop and maintain intervention and rehabilitation programs for returning troops who have developed post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), experienced traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and/or other behavioral health problems associated with an individual's inability to reintegrate into civilian life. Some states and local communities currently lack access, coordination and/or professional intervention services of mental health providers and related support systems. The NG faces unique challenges to provide mental health support to its Service Members. NG Armories and Wings are community based and are seldom within the catchment area of a military treatment facility; and have varying degrees of capabilities between communities and states. Since the NG does not provide treatment, all treatment is received externally through the Military Health System, TRICARE, the Veterans Health Administration (VA), health insurance provided through a NG Service Member's or civilian spouse's civilian employer, and personal finances.  Additionally, psychological health is not a standardized program of the NG, resulting in an inconsistency between psychological health needs and a state's/territory's ability to design and implement a psychological health program.

<DESC>THIS IS A REVISED SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.  The Solicitation Number for this announcement is N40083-12-R-2512; The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Midwest, PWD Crane, is currently seeking potential sources for an Indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a base period of twelve months and two (2) 12-month option periods to be exercised at the Governments discretion.  The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 237310, Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33,500,000.00.  It is the Governments intent to utilize the contract resulting from a future solicitation to accomplish Horizontal Construction Services via an IDIQ Requirements contract with no guaranteed minimum and no guaranteed maximum for the contract term.
  

This sources sought notice is being revised to clarify the requirements and to ensure responses are received from an accurate group of Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HUB Zone concerns, Woman owned small business concerns, or small business concerns.

Under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) guidelines, the prime contractor must perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.  The intent is to issue a solicitation on a set aside basis to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HUB Zone concerns, Woman owned small business concerns, or small business concerns.  The type of set-aside to be issued will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis.
   The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of contractors.  If an adequate number of qualified responses are not received from these businesses, then the Government will issue the solicitation as unrestricted.

The intention of the future solicitation is to obtain Horizontal Construction Services as outlined below and described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) primarily at the Naval Support Activity, Crane, Indiana and at the Glendora Test Facility, Sullivan, Indiana.    The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, management, materials, supplies, equipment, tools, transportation, incidental engineering, and vehicles to perform all work associated with Horizontal Construction Services including but not limited to excavation and fill, asphalt repairs/replacement, highway striping, guardrail repair/replacement, concrete work, culvert replacement, fence repair/replacement, erosion control, stone road and lot maintenance, sidewalk repair/replacement, highway sign maintenance repair/replacement and incidental related work.
  Historically, asphalt overlays have accounted for approximately 87 percent of the work. In addition to complying with the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications, the contractor must also meet all Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) Specifications 2012.  The contractor or subcontractor performing the specific type of work must be a certified asphalt producer with INDOT  and must be listed on the INDOT prequalified bidders list under all the following work types: B(A), C(A), C(B), E(E), E(F), E(H), E(I), E(J), E(K), E(T), 0085.  All work completed on this contract must be completed by a contractor with all these INDOT codes.  Both NSA Crane and the Glendora Test Facility are remote locations.
  For security purposes at NSA Crane, all material deliveries shall enter through the Crane Gate, located at the East end of State Highway 558.  NSA Crane has approximately 411 miles of roads (156 miles paved and 255 miles stone), which are scattered over 100 square miles.  An asphalt overlay project may be as far away as 20 miles from the Crane Gate.  Minimum HMA temperatures at the time of compaction shall not be more than 18 degrees F below the minimum mixing temperature as shown on the JMF, in accordance with INDOT 401.14.  All asphalt sampling and testing must be completed by an INDOT approved HMA Mix Design Laboratory.

Best Value Source selection procedures will be utilized in conducting this competitive negotiation, which will consist of the submission of price and technical proposals once the Request for Proposal is issued.
  

Interested Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone concerns, woman owned small business concerns, or small business concerns should indicate their interest to the contracting Officer in writing. As a minimum the following information is required in duplicate: (a) a copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a  HUBZone concern, (b) describe your partnering, teaming or joint venture intentions, (c) a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor, (d) evidence of experiences in the past three years in work similar in type, size, scope, and complexity to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact, along with telephone numbers, (e) describe specific portions of this type of effort your company intends to subcontract and (f) provide evidence of your company performing these efforts successfully (Indicators of successful performance as measured by percentage of award fee given or favorable past performance ratings, and or awards received, etc.) All of the above must be submitted in duplicate, and in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on availability of interested Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone concerns, woman owned small business concerns or other small business concerns.
  Failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor not being considered as an interested Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HUBZone concern, woman owned small business concern, or small business concern. If adequate interest is not received from any of the above categories the future solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. 

Anticipate the solicitation will be released on or about April, 1, 2012. In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(7) availability of the solicitation will be limited to the electronic medium and the Government will NOT provide copies.  The Solicitation once issued will be available for download free of charge via the Internet at: www.neco.navy.mil or www.fbo.gov .

The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets and&nbsp;to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.</p>

A contract is expected to be awarded within&nbsp;ninety (90)&nbsp;days of proposal submission. All dates are subject to change.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Beyond Granite: A Design Competition for a Temporary Commemorative Installation at the Ariel Rios Hemicycle, Washington, DC<br /></span></strong><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Introduction<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">The US General Services Administration (GSA), working with the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), announces a competition for a temporary commemorative installation at the Ariel Rios Hemicycle, on 12<sup>th</sup> Street NW, Washington, DC, adjacent to the Ariel Rios Federal Building, which houses the headquarters of the US Environmental Protection Agency. The winning proposal will feature a site-specific, temporary work that commemorates the founding principles and legacy of Earth Day-an environmental subject not otherwise represented in the city's commemorative landscape-and which does so in a way that expands the palette of form and material for commemorative works in Washington.<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Project Background<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Historically, commemorative installations and memorials in Washington have been designed for the ages. They tend to feature works of stone and granite, set within a solemn landscape that often encompasses multiple acres dedicated solely to a commemorative purpose. Construction costs are high; recent projects range between sixty to one hundred twenty million dollars in costs. The Commemorative Works Act established a process for evaluating the subject matter, location, and form of permanent commemorative works in the Washington region, and the process can be complex and lengthy. It begins with an act of Congress, and often takes 10 years until project realization.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">In 2010, NCPC sponsored a forum entitled <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Beyond Granite: Global Approaches to Public Art and Placemaking</em>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The program featured public artists and arts administrators discussing temporary works such as the World Trade Center <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tribute in Light</em> and London's <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Fourth Plinth</em> program in Trafalgar Square. Panelists discussed how a program of temporary commemorative works could be used to enrich the cultural landscape in Washington, DC, by providing a means to recognize issues and events that might not otherwise fit within the confines of the Commemorative Works Act, while alleviating the pressure of demands for permanent memorial sites in the Monumental Core. Such a program would also create opportunities for artists to experiment with new and dynamic kinds of designs and materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">The <em>Beyond Granite</em> competition has been</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"> conceived to pick up where this conversation left off. The goal of the competition is to encourage more public dialogue about alternative ways to commemorate, and also to experiment with temporary forms of commemoration that can contribute to more vital public spaces within the nation's capital.&nbsp;<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Site Description<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">The site is a grassy semi-circle along 12<sup>th</sup> Street NW in the Federal Triangle area of Washington, DC. Immediately in front of the Ariel Rios Federal Building, it is known as the Ariel Rios Hemicycle. Although the site is adjacent to the Federal Triangle Metrorail Station and is a nexus for vehicular and pedestrian traffic moving between the National Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue and between the Old Post Office Pavilion and the Woodrow Wilson Plaza, the site itself is underutilized and undistinguished. Through the competition, NCPC and GSA seek to activate the site and make it a more memorable and attractive public space.&nbsp; </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Concurrent with this competition, NCPC and GSA will be making permanent site enhancements such as new seating and improvements to the landscaping. Any other proposed modifications to the site must not permanently impact the fa&ccedil;ade of the historic Ariel Rios Federal Building, and also must not adversely affect the operations or structure of the Metrorail station located under the site.&nbsp;<br /></span><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Competition Theme<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">While the overall objective of this competition is to explore opportunities created through temporary forms of commemoration, a theme has been identified to provide a focus for competition submissions-that of Earth Day. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Earth Day began, and continues as, a grass-roots effort to promote environmental awareness and broaden responsibility for our planet. It is now the largest civic observance in the world, with more than 1 billion people participating. Earth Day continues to inspire individuals, businesses, diverse organizations and communities. Since the first Earth Day in 1970, this annual awareness and educational event has broadened support for environmental actions and programs at the local, national and international levels. In fact, some of the early Earth Day celebrations are now remembered for launching modern environmental awareness. In the U.S., Earth Day inspired passage of many groundbreaking environmental laws and helped lead to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose offices are housed immediately adjacent to the competition site.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">NCPC and GSA seek proposals that embody defining precepts of the founding of Earth Day, its legacy, and environmentally sustainable practices. Works should inspire the audience to reflect upon the impact of Earth Day over the past 40 years, environmental achievements going forward, and the challenges that remain.

Instructions for the
Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security - MDS2
Version 1.0
Introduction
In light of increased focus on medical device security and the upcoming April 21, 2005 deadline for compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule, the HIMSS Medical Device Security Workgroup has created a standard Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2). The intent of the MDS2 is to supply healthcare providers with important information that can assist them in assessing the vulnerability and risks associated with electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)  transmitted or maintained by medical devices.  Because security risk assessment is a broad, organization-wide effort, this document focuses on only those elements of the risk assessment process associated with medical devices and systems that maintain or transmit ePHI.  A standardized form allows manufacturers to quickly respond to a potentially large volume of requests from providers for information regarding the security-related features of the medical devices they manufacture.  The standardized form also facilitates the providers' review of the large volume of security-related information supplied by the manufacturers. This form was adapted from portions of the ACCE/ECRI Biomedical Equipment Survey Form, a key tool found in Information Security for Biomedical Technology:  A HIPAA Compliance Guide (ACCE/ECRI, 2004).  HIMSS recommends that the information in the MDS2 be used to help complete the ACCE/ECRI form and associated processes as part of each organization's HIPAA Security compliance efforts.
The manufacturer-completed MDS2 should: 
(1)	Be useful to healthcare provider organizations worldwide.  
While the form does supply information important to providers who must comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, the information presented is intended to be useful for any healthcare provider who aspires to have an effective information security and risk management program.  Outside the US, providers would therefore find the MDS2 an effective tool in addressing such regional regulations as EC 95/46, HPB 517, and PIPEDA. 
(2)	Include device-specific information addressing the technical security-related attributes of the individual device model.
This completed MDS2 form provides a simple, flexible way of collecting the technical, device-specific elements of the total information needed by provider organizations (device users/operators) in preparing for their first round of medical device risk assessments.  Providers around the world should find a completed MDS2 form useful in controlling information security (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) risks. Note, however, that the MDS2 is not intended and should not be used as a basis for medical device procurement.  Writing procurement specifications requires a deeper and more extensive knowledge of security and the provider's mission.
Using the information provided by the manufacturer in the MDS2 combined with information collected about the care delivery environment (e.g., through tools like ACCE / ECRI's guide for Information Security for Biomedical Technology), the provider's multidisciplinary risk assessment team can review assembled information and make informed decisions on implementing a local security management plan.
The Role of Healthcare Providers and Medical Device Manufacturers in the Security Management Process
Responsibility for effective security management must ultimately lie with the provider organization.  Generally the device manufacturers can assist providers in their security management programs by offering information associated with 
"	the type of data maintained / transmitted by the manufacturer's device or system
"	how data is maintained / transmitted by the manufacturer's device or system
"	any security-related features incorporated in the manufacturer's device or system
In order to effectively manage medical information security and comply with relevant regulations, healthcare providers must employ administrative, physical and technical safeguards, most of which (other than some technical safeguards) must be adopted and employed on-site extrinsic to the actual device.  Other than some general recommendations with regard to medical devices:
"	there are few ADMINISTRATIVE safeguards manufacturers can address beyond providing assistance in security training
"	there are few PHYSICAL safeguards manufacturers can address beyond incorporating physical security features (e.g., component lock & key, theft/intrusion alarms) in their devices
The greatest impact manufacturers can have on medical device security is to incorporate TECHNICAL Safeguards (i.e., security features) in their devices to facilitate the providers efforts in maintaining an effective security program and meeting any relevant regulations.   The medical device manufacturing industry is increasingly aware of the importance of having effective security features in their devices and systems.  Manufacturers are generally including such features in the production of new devices and systems based provider needs and requirements.
Instructions for Obtaining and Using the MDS2
Information provided on the MDS2 is intended to assist professionals knowledgeable in security and risk assessment processes in their management of medical device security issues.  The information on the MDS2 is not intended and may be inappropriate for any other purpose.
Completed MDS2 forms for many devices and systems may be available directly from the device manufacturer.   Check the manufacturer's web site first for relevant forms and, when not available there, contact a manufacturer's representative to request a MDS2 for the appropriate device(s)/system(s).  If a manufacturer does not have a completed MDS2 for the appropriate device(s)/system(s), enter the device category,  manufacturer and model information in the appropriate boxes on the top of a blank form  and submit the form(s) and these instructions to the manufacturer's compliance office for their completion. 
Note that HIMSS suggests that a standard naming convention be used for the device category terms and manufacturer names listed on the form.  This assists providers in matching information from the form to their equipment inventories.  ECRI's Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS) is the most widely used.  Adopted by thousands of healthcare providers worldwide, UMDNS has been adopted by the National Library of Medicine into its Universal Medical Language System, and has been recommended by the Institute of Medicine for inclusion in the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) core terminology group.  For more information about UMDNS contact ECRI at www.ecri.org.
Side 1 of the MDS2 contains descriptive information on the type of data maintained/transmitted by device, how the data is maintained/transmitted, and any security-related features incorporated in the device.  Side 2 contains manufacturer-optional recommended security practices and space for numbered explanatory notes that may expand on answers to questions 1 through 19.  Manufacturers may elect to attach supplementary material if additional space for recommended practices or explanatory notes is necessary.
Question-specific notes.
1.	Maintaining ePHI includes storage on an internal disk, removable media, short-term computer memory, etc.
Transmitting ePHI includes receiving/sending external to the device via network, telephone, direct connect cable, removable media, etc.
2.	The four sections of this question relate directly to the 18 data elements referred to in HIPAA, any of which, if present, render the entire electronically transmitted/maintained data set as ePHI.  The 18 data elements included in the Rule are: 
"	Name
"	Geographic data (e.g., address)
"	Dates (e.g., date of birth, admission, discharge, death, treatment)
"	Telephone No.
"	Fax No.
"	E-mail address
"	Social Security No.
"	Medical record No.
"	Health plan beneficiary No.	"	Account No.
"	Certificate/license numbers
"	Vehicle identifiers
"	Device identifiers
"	Universal Resource Locators (URLs)
"	IP address numbers
"	Biometric identifiers
"	Full face (or comparable) photographic images 
"	Any unique identifying number, characteristic, or code
The open, unstructured text question (2d) is intended to indicate an additional element where a provider might put further identifying information.
3.	Here the manufacturer provides more detail on how ePHI is maintained.  Note that a fully networked device is likely to have all three items with a 'Yes' response.
"	Persistently on local media refers to media created or directly attached to the device under consideration (e.g., MR Scanner, 3-D workstation), not a remote archive. 
"	Import/export ePHI refers to data that is sourced or destined to remote storage devices (e.g., an MR scanner that relies on an image server in a PACS system).
4.	Import and export refer to movement of information via published open protocols to devices outside of the medical device under consideration (e.g., medical information bus (IEEE 1073), serial port, and published protocol that allows general access to ePHI).  Dedicated cable here refers to communication via a point to point cable to a device or system outside of the device under consideration.
5.	This question includes either explicit security training or explicit sections of administrator or user manuals that detail the device security features and their use.
6.	This question identifies the underlying 3rd party system software platform (operating system) name or indicates if there is no 3rd party platform (i.e., proprietary system created for this manufacturer alone).
7.	Refers to the typical installation of the manufacturer's device.
8.	Refers to an integrated feature that supports information backup onto removable media (e.g., optical disk, magnetic disk, tape).
9.	Identifies whether it is possible to start the device with software from any source other than the manufacturer's normal startup device (e.g., an integral hard disk or ROM).
10.	Does the device allow, through root access, administrative privilege, or other non-intrusive method, a local user and/or IT staff to install software not provided and not explicitly authorized by the manufacturer (e.g., email client, office applications, virus scanner, browsers, games)?
11.	Remote service refers to device maintenance activities performed by a service person via network or other remote connection.
12.	Level of owner/operator access to device operating system.  Here the manufacturer details what is technically possible if the device owner (generally the healthcare provider) has the technical ability to install security controls on the medical device under consideration. A MANUFACTURER ANSWERING 'YES' TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE MANUFACTURER AUTHORIZES THE OWNER TO PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS. THE OWNER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION or REPAIRS. UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION or REPAIRS MAY VOID APPLICABLE WARRANTIES AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS. Authorization to perform these security-related services or changes to a medical device should be obtained in writing from the device manufacturer. Unauthorized changes to a medical device may remove it from government regulatory controls (e.g., FDA) and render the device an experimental medical device.
13.	Self-explanatory.
14.	Self-explanatory.
15.	Clarifications:
"	Controlled viewing refers to operations that have to do with the display, printing, or other use of ePHI (e.g., image display, record print-out).
"	Creation, modification, or deletion would mean that all these events are tracked in the log file.
"	Export or transmittal refers to the movement of ePHI outside of the device under consideration.
16.	Emergency access features allow operators emergency access to the device in cases where the normal authentication cannot be successfully completed or is not working properly. 
17.	Self-explanatory.
18.	Clarifications:
"	Physically secure connection is a cabling system that is not accessible to the general public. (i.e., it is in a physically controlled space such as examining rooms, communication closets, or building plenum).
"	Fixed list is an explicit mechanism that limits the connections and nature of connections on a per-device basis.
19.	Ensure integrity refers to methods that can detect and/or correct differences between the source makeup of an ePHI message and the ePHI message received by an external device.

Instructions for the
Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security - MDS2
Version 1.0
Introduction
In light of increased focus on medical device security and the upcoming April 21, 2005 deadline for compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule, the HIMSS Medical Device Security Workgroup has created a standard Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2). The intent of the MDS2 is to supply healthcare providers with important information that can assist them in assessing the vulnerability and risks associated with electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)  transmitted or maintained by medical devices.  Because security risk assessment is a broad, organization-wide effort, this document focuses on only those elements of the risk assessment process associated with medical devices and systems that maintain or transmit ePHI.  A standardized form allows manufacturers to quickly respond to a potentially large volume of requests from providers for information regarding the security-related features of the medical devices they manufacture.  The standardized form also facilitates the providers' review of the large volume of security-related information supplied by the manufacturers. This form was adapted from portions of the ACCE/ECRI Biomedical Equipment Survey Form, a key tool found in Information Security for Biomedical Technology:  A HIPAA Compliance Guide (ACCE/ECRI, 2004).  HIMSS recommends that the information in the MDS2 be used to help complete the ACCE/ECRI form and associated processes as part of each organization's HIPAA Security compliance efforts.
The manufacturer-completed MDS2 should: 
(1)	Be useful to healthcare provider organizations worldwide.  
While the form does supply information important to providers who must comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, the information presented is intended to be useful for any healthcare provider who aspires to have an effective information security and risk management program.  Outside the US, providers would therefore find the MDS2 an effective tool in addressing such regional regulations as EC 95/46, HPB 517, and PIPEDA. 
(2)	Include device-specific information addressing the technical security-related attributes of the individual device model.
This completed MDS2 form provides a simple, flexible way of collecting the technical, device-specific elements of the total information needed by provider organizations (device users/operators) in preparing for their first round of medical device risk assessments.  Providers around the world should find a completed MDS2 form useful in controlling information security (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) risks. Note, however, that the MDS2 is not intended and should not be used as a basis for medical device procurement.  Writing procurement specifications requires a deeper and more extensive knowledge of security and the provider's mission.
Using the information provided by the manufacturer in the MDS2 combined with information collected about the care delivery environment (e.g., through tools like ACCE / ECRI's guide for Information Security for Biomedical Technology), the provider's multidisciplinary risk assessment team can review assembled information and make informed decisions on implementing a local security management plan.
The Role of Healthcare Providers and Medical Device Manufacturers in the Security Management Process
Responsibility for effective security management must ultimately lie with the provider organization.  Generally the device manufacturers can assist providers in their security management programs by offering information associated with 
"	the type of data maintained / transmitted by the manufacturer's device or system
"	how data is maintained / transmitted by the manufacturer's device or system
"	any security-related features incorporated in the manufacturer's device or system
In order to effectively manage medical information security and comply with relevant regulations, healthcare providers must employ administrative, physical and technical safeguards, most of which (other than some technical safeguards) must be adopted and employed on-site extrinsic to the actual device.  Other than some general recommendations with regard to medical devices:
"	there are few ADMINISTRATIVE safeguards manufacturers can address beyond providing assistance in security training
"	there are few PHYSICAL safeguards manufacturers can address beyond incorporating physical security features (e.g., component lock & key, theft/intrusion alarms) in their devices
The greatest impact manufacturers can have on medical device security is to incorporate TECHNICAL Safeguards (i.e., security features) in their devices to facilitate the providers efforts in maintaining an effective security program and meeting any relevant regulations.   The medical device manufacturing industry is increasingly aware of the importance of having effective security features in their devices and systems.  Manufacturers are generally including such features in the production of new devices and systems based provider needs and requirements.
Instructions for Obtaining and Using the MDS2
Information provided on the MDS2 is intended to assist professionals knowledgeable in security and risk assessment processes in their management of medical device security issues.  The information on the MDS2 is not intended and may be inappropriate for any other purpose.
Completed MDS2 forms for many devices and systems may be available directly from the device manufacturer.   Check the manufacturer's web site first for relevant forms and, when not available there, contact a manufacturer's representative to request a MDS2 for the appropriate device(s)/system(s).  If a manufacturer does not have a completed MDS2 for the appropriate device(s)/system(s), enter the device category,  manufacturer and model information in the appropriate boxes on the top of a blank form  and submit the form(s) and these instructions to the manufacturer's compliance office for their completion. 
Note that HIMSS suggests that a standard naming convention be used for the device category terms and manufacturer names listed on the form.  This assists providers in matching information from the form to their equipment inventories.  ECRI's Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS) is the most widely used.  Adopted by thousands of healthcare providers worldwide, UMDNS has been adopted by the National Library of Medicine into its Universal Medical Language System, and has been recommended by the Institute of Medicine for inclusion in the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) core terminology group.  For more information about UMDNS contact ECRI at www.ecri.org.
Side 1 of the MDS2 contains descriptive information on the type of data maintained/transmitted by device, how the data is maintained/transmitted, and any security-related features incorporated in the device.  Side 2 contains manufacturer-optional recommended security practices and space for numbered explanatory notes that may expand on answers to questions 1 through 19.  Manufacturers may elect to attach supplementary material if additional space for recommended practices or explanatory notes is necessary.
Question-specific notes.
1.	Maintaining ePHI includes storage on an internal disk, removable media, short-term computer memory, etc.
Transmitting ePHI includes receiving/sending external to the device via network, telephone, direct connect cable, removable media, etc.
2.	The four sections of this question relate directly to the 18 data elements referred to in HIPAA, any of which, if present, render the entire electronically transmitted/maintained data set as ePHI.  The 18 data elements included in the Rule are: 
"	Name
"	Geographic data (e.g., address)
"	Dates (e.g., date of birth, admission, discharge, death, treatment)
"	Telephone No.
"	Fax No.
"	E-mail address
"	Social Security No.
"	Medical record No.
"	Health plan beneficiary No.	"	Account No.
"	Certificate/license numbers
"	Vehicle identifiers
"	Device identifiers
"	Universal Resource Locators (URLs)
"	IP address numbers
"	Biometric identifiers
"	Full face (or comparable) photographic images 
"	Any unique identifying number, characteristic, or code
The open, unstructured text question (2d) is intended to indicate an additional element where a provider might put further identifying information.
3.	Here the manufacturer provides more detail on how ePHI is maintained.  Note that a fully networked device is likely to have all three items with a 'Yes' response.
"	Persistently on local media refers to media created or directly attached to the device under consideration (e.g., MR Scanner, 3-D workstation), not a remote archive. 
"	Import/export ePHI refers to data that is sourced or destined to remote storage devices (e.g., an MR scanner that relies on an image server in a PACS system).
4.	Import and export refer to movement of information via published open protocols to devices outside of the medical device under consideration (e.g., medical information bus (IEEE 1073), serial port, and published protocol that allows general access to ePHI).  Dedicated cable here refers to communication via a point to point cable to a device or system outside of the device under consideration.
5.	This question includes either explicit security training or explicit sections of administrator or user manuals that detail the device security features and their use.
6.	This question identifies the underlying 3rd party system software platform (operating system) name or indicates if there is no 3rd party platform (i.e., proprietary system created for this manufacturer alone).
7.	Refers to the typical installation of the manufacturer's device.
8.	Refers to an integrated feature that supports information backup onto removable media (e.g., optical disk, magnetic disk, tape).
9.	Identifies whether it is possible to start the device with software from any source other than the manufacturer's normal startup device (e.g., an integral hard disk or ROM).
10.	Does the device allow, through root access, administrative privilege, or other non-intrusive method, a local user and/or IT staff to install software not provided and not explicitly authorized by the manufacturer (e.g., email client, office applications, virus scanner, browsers, games)?
11.	Remote service refers to device maintenance activities performed by a service person via network or other remote connection.
12.	Level of owner/operator access to device operating system.  Here the manufacturer details what is technically possible if the device owner (generally the healthcare provider) has the technical ability to install security controls on the medical device under consideration. A MANUFACTURER ANSWERING 'YES' TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE MANUFACTURER AUTHORIZES THE OWNER TO PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS. THE OWNER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION or REPAIRS. UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION or REPAIRS MAY VOID APPLICABLE WARRANTIES AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS. Authorization to perform these security-related services or changes to a medical device should be obtained in writing from the device manufacturer. Unauthorized changes to a medical device may remove it from government regulatory controls (e.g., FDA) and render the device an experimental medical device.
13.	Self-explanatory.
14.	Self-explanatory.
15.	Clarifications:
"	Controlled viewing refers to operations that have to do with the display, printing, or other use of ePHI (e.g., image display, record print-out).
"	Creation, modification, or deletion would mean that all these events are tracked in the log file.
"	Export or transmittal refers to the movement of ePHI outside of the device under consideration.
16.	Emergency access features allow operators emergency access to the device in cases where the normal authentication cannot be successfully completed or is not working properly. 
17.	Self-explanatory.
18.	Clarifications:
"	Physically secure connection is a cabling system that is not accessible to the general public. (i.e., it is in a physically controlled space such as examining rooms, communication closets, or building plenum).
"	Fixed list is an explicit mechanism that limits the connections and nature of connections on a per-device basis.
19.	Ensure integrity refers to methods that can detect and/or correct differences between the source makeup of an ePHI message and the ePHI message received by an external device. Is such a method available for use as part of the device under consideration (either in transmission or receipt of ePHI)?

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER<br />THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br /><br />I. AGENCY/ACTIVITY/CONTRACT IDENTIFICATION:<br />United States Air Force<br />22 CONS/LGCA<br />Contracting Officer: William J. Carbrey III, DSN 743-4513<br />Contract: FA4621-09-D-0002, P00003<br />53384 Kansas Street, Building 840<br />McConnell AFB, Kansas 67221-3606 <br /><br />II. DESCRIPTION OF THIS ACTION:<br />A. Upon approval, 22 CONS will execute a bilateral contract modification increasing the subject contract ceiling by *******<br />B. Type J&amp;A: Individual<br /><br />III. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES:<br />Narrative Description: This contract provides architect and engineering (A&amp;E) services including design analysis, development of preliminary and final plans, specifications, cost estimates and bid schedules as required for facility maintenance, repair, alteration and new construction at McConnell AFB, KS. The contract is currently in its second option year with the current performance period ending on 31 Mar 12. Due to higher than expected volume of design work for demolition and construction projects, the contract will exceed its maximum contract value prior to completion of the current performance period if all currently planned projects are funded. There are currently five projects which have received a reservation of funds for FY12. One of the projects,<br />PRQE #12-0134 - Repair Basewide Generator Infrastucture, is planned as a seed project for the new A&amp;E contract, the remaining projects are:<br /><br />PRQE #12-0102B - Demolish/Consolidate Repair/Fabrication Shop Bldg 1128<br />PRQE #12-0108B - Demolish/Consolidate LRS Bldg 1169<br />PRQE #14-0101B - Demolish/Consolidate Administrative Buildings (Multi-Facilities)<br />PRQE #11-0100A - Comprehensive Interior Design (CID), Bldg 850<br />The total estimated cost for the projects above is Approval for an additional $$<br />, for a total of $$ on the current contract is requested to ensure adequate<br />coverage for potentially higher proposed/negotiated amounts, contingencies, changes, etc. The Government intends to execute the work, subject to funds availability, before expiration of the current option period; however, if required, the option to extend services will be used.<br /><br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY:<br /><br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />V. APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:<br /><br />In accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the ability to execute limited follow-on contract orders above the current ceiling on the existing contract will avoid unacceptable delays and additional cost in fulfilling our requirements. Due to the uncertain funding environment, it is not possible to accurately estimate the amount of funding or<br />timing of receipt for year-end construction projects. Given this situation, the Government cannot always develop a new contract, in the event one is needed, in sufficient time to allow for execution of funding if received prior to the end of the fiscal year. The projects under discussion are follow on Demolition/ construction design projects from previous studies (charrettes) completed by the incumbent (GLMV Architecture). As the design firm responsible for the initial projects, GLMV is uniquely qualified and possesses the requisite experience to deliver the final design packages at the best price and within the required time period to support receipt of construction funds prior to fiscal<br />year end. Additionally, approximately $$ was spent developing the charrettes for the listed projects. It is estimated that a new firm could require an additional 950-1,200 hrs resulting in increased costs between $$&nbsp;and $$&nbsp;which is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />VI. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:<br /><br />This contract was originally competed. The current contractor, GLMV, developed the initial studies for these design projects. There is no other firm that can provide additional design and engineering work without significant increased cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government plans to compete a new A&amp;E contract in the first<br />half of FY12. Additionally, the Government plans to issue a multiple-award<br />contract for the follow-on A&amp;E requirements, which will ease year-end execution constraints and create more competition for future design work.<br /><br />VII. FAIR AND REASONABLE COSTS:<br /><br />This acquisition is exempt from the requirement of cost and pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b)(3). Engineering hours will be reviewed by Civil Engineering personnel and negotiated to arrive at a fair and reasonable price for the effort. Previous project/work history will also be used for comparison. At this time, the contracting officer anticipates the cost to the Government will be<br />fair and reasonable.<br /><br />VIII. MARKET RESEARCH:<br /><br />As stated above, due to the recent work done by the incumbent firm in preparing the studies, the requirements are not available for competition, due to the unique nature of the services required.&nbsp; Having recently completed market research as part of the acquisition planning for the new contract,<br />it is evident that no other architecture firm is in a position to deliver the requirements as expeditiously and effectively as GLMV due to their project-specific experience under the existing contract.<br /><br />IX. OTHER FACTORS:&nbsp; None.<br /><br />X. INTERESTED SOURCES:&nbsp; None.<br /><br />XI. STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION:<br /><br />The Government will continue to perform market research and is in the process of developing a new multiple-award A&amp;E contract which will be solicited in early FY12.<br /><br />XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION:<br /><br />The Contracting Officer has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge.</p>
