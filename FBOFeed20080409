<DESC><p>This notice serves as a presolicitation notice/procurement synopsis for the High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) Targeting System (HTS) Program Office. The 308th Armament Systems Wing (ARSW), 693d Armament Systems Squadron (ARSS), intends to issue a follow-on sole source award to Raytheon Company in Tucson, AZ. This effort is to provide HTS Contractor Logistics Support, including depot repair services and sustaining engineering for HTS pods, as well as an entire variety of other HTS sustainment-related services and supplies as an as-needed basis thereby maintaining HTS availability for war fighter use with a performance date beginning 1 December 2008. This pre-solicitation notice covers all CLINs under the proposed contract, including any option CLINs and other CLINs for non-recurring work. The HTS Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) is anticipated to be Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) for the recurring repair and sustaining engineering effort. The non-recurring effort will be awarded on an as-required basis under separate over and above CLINs. These separate over and above CLINs are anticipated to be priced as FFP, Time and Materials (T&amp;M), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), or Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) with performance incentives. The contract is planned to be awarded in November 08 as a one-year contract with two one-year options (1 Dec 08 - 30 Nov 11). The estimated value of this contract (to include all options) is $75M.
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate a Request For Proposal (RFP) via Integrated Product Team (IPT) pricing with only one source under the authorities of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii) and 6.302-6 (a) (2). The Government does not have complete and adequate data, special materials, facilities, tooling, or test equipment which will be required in the performance of the contract. Also, HTS contains an acknowledged Special Access Required (SAR) anti-tamper program which limits disclosure of information necessary to perform the contract. The anticipated award date for this acquisition is 15 Nov 08.</p>
<p>Since this requirement will be done via IPT pricing, the letter of solicitation, proposal, model contract, and negotiations will be done jointly with the contractor. This is expected to begin in early Jun 08. The NAICS Code/Size Standard is 811219/$6.5M. Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Jon Olson (Raytheon Company) at the above address or phone (520) 794-2524.</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to Ms. Cheryl Owens, Contract Specialist, 850-883-0712, FAX (850) 883-0543 or Mr. David Hooker, Contracting Officer, 850-883-0295, FAX (850) 883-0543. Facsimile responses or requests sent to (850) 883-0543 are authorized if you also call and verify receipt. Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORKSTEAM PIPE & VALVE REPLACEMENTA.    ITEM I, The original hospital construction included low (8 psig) and medium (50 psig) pressure steam supply and return mains in a tunnel system.  The mains run from the boiler plant out to the vertical risers. The project consists of the replacement of all existing condensate piping and valves located in the tunnel system. The project also includes replacement of certain existing steam piping and valves located in the 3'x3' branch tunnels (steam piping and valves in main full-height tunnel will remain). The branch run outs from the tunnel to the risers were originally buried beneath the floor and will remain. The bid documents will identify work in the main tunnel (full height tunnel) which will be deleted as part of a Deduct bid alternate.Based on the original 1948 drawings, the main tunnel contains approximately 165 feet each of 8" low pressure steam, 4" medium pressure steam, 4" low pressure condensate, and 3" medium pressure condensate piping. There are approximately 900 feet of branch tunnels (3'x3' tunnels) which contain various sizes of low & medium pressure steam and low & medium pressure condensate piping.The project shall include removal of all items identified as abandoned on the Drawings in the tunnel system to make way for the new installations. In addition, access to some of the steam and condensate piping will require demolition and replacement of some other active piping located above the steam and condensate lines.The low pressure steam system is only required for heating and can therefore be shut down during a portion of the summer months. The medium pressure steam system is required year-round, and work must be phased to minimize downtime.Portions of the 3'x3' tunnels are not accessible and will require new access doors in the floor above as shown on the drawings. These inaccessible sections of tunnel may have asbestos containing materials which will require abatement (abatement is not part of this Bid). The Contractor will notify the VA of any F&T traps (or other non-"Steamgard" traps) found during demolition, and the VA will contract separately with Steamgard to replace such traps once access has been established.B.    DEDUCT ALTERNATE NO.1: Delete the replacement of the low pressure and medium pressure condensate return mains in the main tunnel (full height tunnel).  The low and medium condensate mains in this area will remain as is.  Branch piping will still be replaced as shown on drawings.  As part of the Alternate, provide non-destructive testing of the piping wall thickness of the existing condensate mains using an ultra-sonic thickness gauge at a minimum of 24 places.  HVAC contractor shall remove a 6" length of pipe insulation at each test point and shall re-install insulation after testing.  Furnish test report to the COTR.

The Statement ofWork (SOW) is as follows:  BACKGROUND.  School Year2008-09 will be the third year of the Bureau of IndianEducations (BIE) Native American Student InformationSystem (NASIS). NASIS was initiated in School Year2006-07. The initiation had three distinct phases, ofwhich two have been completed. Phase 1 was a pilotcompleted in School Year 2006-07. Phase 2 wascompleted in School Year 2007-08, the roll-outtraining and implementation in all 184 bureau-fundedschools and 22 Education Line Offices (ELO). Phase 3is currently on-going, the reporting and analysis ofstudent data entered in NASIS.   NASIS is a web-basecentralized Application Service Provider (ASP) studentinformation system meeting the unique geographical,environmental, and technological requirements andconstraints of the BIEs national school systemlocated in 23 states, with approximately 50,000students (ISEP and non-ISEP) in grades kindergarten totwelve.  ISEP is the Indian School EqualizationProgram, which is the primary funding source for allbureau-funded schools. The BIE is comprised of aWashington, DC Central Office, an Albuquerque, NMService Center (ASC), 22 Education Line Offices (ELO),and 184 schools and dormitories in the continentalUnited States. Relative to Federal reportingrequirements, the BIE is considered a State entity.Thus, NASIS is set up as both a state and school levelfunctionality.   This Statement of Work (SOW) buildsupon the prior two school years to address thefollowing new and continuing NASIS needs: (1)operations and maintenance in all bureau-fundedschools, ELO, Washington, DC national and Albuquerque,NM Service Center offices, (2) training for new andreturning school, ELO, Washington, DC, and ACS staff,(3) help desk and support services; and (4) reportingdelivery and analysis.

In the future, the algorithm developed in this contract can be applied and expanded to other managed care settings for ongoing surveillance and research.

Responses shall be no more than 10 pages and should include the following: 1) Contractors capabilities overview; 2) Past performance information (relevant experience to perform the required services); and 3) Price of the deliverables.  All responses will be evaluated on a best value basis using the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical and Management Approach – the likelihood of effectively meeting requirements; 2) Past performance – the relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price – the amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price ( the fully loaded labor rate and anticipated hours).  The Government intends to award an order to the responsible offeror whose quotation offers the best combination of technical capabilities and proposed price.

TRC is uniquely qualified and has in-depth knowledge of the site conditions, environmental setting, and a complete understanding of all contaminated media.  TRC has been on-site at the Technical Center since 1986, and has participated in all phases of site remediation, from initial site characterizations through the final design of the existing treatment systems, and has conducted the initial evaluations for enhancing the existing treatment systems.  TRC has exclusive site-specific expertise in environmental investigations, remediation and design; hydrogeological conditions; and ecological risk assessment and investigations.  
TRC's high level of professional competency with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), and the Pinelands Commission has provided significant benefits and cost savings to the FAA.  The Government estimates that it would take a minimum of one year of "time required" for another contractor to reach the required level of competence possessed by TRC.  This learning curve would result in a potential additional cost to the FAA of approximately $2.7 million, and would ultimately delay the implementation of the remedial enhancements, further increasing the cost of using an alternate contractor.  Nonetheless, the Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) that was signed with the EPA establishes stringent compliance schedules for accomplishing the investigation and cleanup of all contaminated sites on the facility.  The FFA imposes stipulated penalties of up to $10,000 per week against the FAA for failure to meet compliance schedules.  Failure to clean up these sites would lead to the contamination of Atlantic City's Reservoir and well field system.  The latter system, a majority of which is located on Center property, provides potable water to 32 million casino visitors per year as well as 40,000 year round residents.
In the past procurement cycles, attempts by the Government to compete this requirement as a full and open procurement resulted in award to TRC.  In 2003, the current procurement was solicited and awarded as a single source contract to TRC as contract no. DTFACT-03-D-00035.
Accordingly, a competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the services outlined above. The FAA will evaluate this information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to AnneMarie Ternay, no later than 2 p.m. (local time) on April 23, 2008.

<DESC>Requisition Number: FDA1041798

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order on a non-competitive sole source basis to Biomerieux, Inc., 100 Rodolphe St., Durham, NC 27712-9402.  FDA will purchase the following: 
24 boxes of ICS Assay kits #30435
24 boxes of ICS Broth #42610
24 boxes of SLM #30702
29 boxes of API 20E Kit #20100
24 boxes of VP-1 and Vp-2 #70422
48 boxes of VIDAS Staph Enterotoxin SET2 #30705
The purpose of the various kits or reagents is to develop methods used for training and the detection of foodborne contaminates which maybe a result of acts of terrorism or natural occurring events that effect our nation’s food source.  The knowledge and information obtained regarding this method for detecting foodborne disease and associated phenomena will enhance FDA’s ability to protect and enhance the safety of the food supply.  Biomerieux Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the Vidas test kits and supplies and accessories.   Center for Disease Control (CDC) has approved no other method for the detection program submitted by FDA under the select agent registered program and there are no potential substitutes.  No other vendors that can provide the capability required for FDA’s research program.  There are no approved substitutes and there are no similar instruments.  In addition, the methods used in the detection program make reproducibility and ease of use the “gold standard”, and this can only be conducted using known and proven methods that have been approved by CDC for all labs in the USA to measure and detect microbial phenotypes.  As the only known standard kits capable of providing the capability necessary, the Biomerieux test kit provides uniformity with the de facto international standard for research and rapid response.  To select any other kits and reagents would place FDA research in this area out of step with the research community and would reduce both the capability and credibility of research in this critical scientific arena.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the Agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All inquiries must be received by 10:00 AM (1000) EST on 24 April 2008 to the attention of David Kordel, david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice. The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL 33620 to assist The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information Access Division (IAD) in creating an evaluation tools set for legacy computer vision detection, tracking, and recognition tasks. The work shall address the needs of the NIST Speech Group to transition the prototype evaluation tools developed by the University of South Florida (USF) to support evaluation activities within the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Video Analysis and Content Extraction (VACE) program. During Phase II of the VACE program, under IARPA sponsorship, NIST provided technical oversight for the development of a number of computer vision evaluation tasks and USF implemented the evaluations and software tools used to score the performance of the assessed algorithms. The transition of the software to the Speech Group’s code base is necessary to ensure that the scoring algorithms developed by USF can be successfully deployed and extended at NIST and used in future NIST-coordinated computer vision evaluations. It will also permit NIST to support legacy use of the research data created in the VACE Phase II Program. The algorithms and software to be transferred were developed by USF. Therefore USF is uniquely qualified to transition these algorithms and tools into NIST code base.  Additionally the personnel who developed the USF software to be supported have the detailed knowledge of the algorithm, metrics, and software developed for the VACE Phase II effort and they have the unique expertise to assist NIST in transitioning these capabilities into NIST-maintained software.

A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about April 17, 2008.  
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis.Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>BACKGROUND

The U.S. Census Bureau's mission is to collect and disseminate timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States.  Over 200 years ago, the United States Constitution laid the foundation for what is today one of the world's largest and most comprehensive data gathering organizations.  Every month, quarter, and year, the Census Bureau plans and conducts over 100 sample surveys that update and add to information from the economic census (taken every five years) and the population census (taken every ten years).  These data collections would be impossible without continuous research and development.  

The Census Bureau's core business is conducting large-scale surveys and censuses.  This includes a full range of activities required to produce data, including list development, sample selection and estimation, questionnaire design, enumeration, and data capture, processing, tabulation, analysis and dissemination.  To remain preeminent in this field, we must conduct scientific research and technological development to support our capabilities to carry out the tasks for surveys and censuses.  We must research methodological and statistical advances that may reduce cost and resources and improve quality.  We must stay abreast of the latest technological advances through assessment and conduct research on the use of such technology to take advantage of its capabilities.  We must be aware of our customers' and respondents' concerns and willingness to participate.  We must evaluate programs and practices to determine if they are achieving desired results at a reasonable cost, especially in light of the current environment of cost effective government programs.  

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) 2013 MARKET RESEARCH REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The U.S. Census Bureau intends to conduct market research with companies/organizations performing research and development to learn more about the industry and best practices currently performed that may be similar in magnitude to a forthcoming Bureau project.  The latter will assist the Bureau in understanding how to ensure small businesses are provided opportunities to the maximum extent possible for the purpose of this project.

The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for Market Research purposes in planning for the R&D 2013 requirement.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) by the Bureau.  The Bureau is not accepting offers at this time nor will the information provided be evaluated or considered as an offer.  This Market Research information does not commit the Bureau to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Census Bureau is not responsible for any administrative cost incurred by a contractor in response to this request.  

Although answers to these questions are optional, the Bureau will appreciate and encourages companies to submit responses based on their knowledge and experience in the field of research and development.  Based on the information provided, and as part of its ongoing market research, the Bureau may contact individual respondents for additional information.

All information provided will be kept confidential and will be utilized for market research purposes directly related to the Research and Development (R&D) 2013 requirement.
 
INSTRUCTIONS

The official website for the R&D 2013 contract has been created and can be accessed at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/rd2013.  Industry representatives are encouraged to visit the website to view the draft statement of work and complete the above-mentioned market research survey.  Please submit your market research responses by 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time on April 16, 2008.

Lanterns must satisfy minimum intensity requirements at specified  divergences, ranging from 327 candelas to 1603 candelas.  Lanterns are required to perform in a marine environment which includes the following conditions:  Operating Temperature range of -30 to +50 degrees C,  humidity 0 to 100%, ice loading up to 22 kg per square meter, wind speeds up to 100 knots, continuous exposure to salt air and seawater spray, continuous exposure to ultraviolet light, exposure to shock and vibration consistent with mounting on buoys or single pile structures, lanterns shall not be susceptible to interference from radiating devices ( e.g. VHF radios and marine radar), lanterns shall incorporate electric surge protection from static discharges and lightning strikes.  Lanterns must provide integral daylight controls (on/ off switches).  Shipments will be made to Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center, Baltimore, MD.  Instruction and services manuals are also required to be provided with the lanterns.  Complete specifications are available upon request.  A Request for Quote (RFQ) will be posted in late April.  Any questions should be directed to Frank Krempa, Contract Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard, (202) 475-3342, or by email to frank.krempa@uscg.mil.

<DESC>Background:  The overarching goal of the USAID P.L. 480 Title II food aid programs is to improve the food security and nutritional status of vulnerable populations around the world. This is achieved by addressing the root causes of food insecurity while also providing direct nutritional support for immediate dietary needs through the consumption of P.L. 480 Title II food aid commodities. The extent to which food aid rations contribute to total dietary requirements varies among different beneficiary populations, impacted by demographics as well as the socioeconomic and environmental conditions within which a beneficiary lives. Health status and the burden of disease are also significant factors that impact nutritional status, the bioavailability of nutrients and an individual’s food security. The sum of these factors determines the optimal quality, quantity and mix of food aid commodities.

Discussion:  The US Agency for International Development intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for which the objective of the activity is to reach a consensus on optimal enrichment and fortification formulas for selected P.L. 480 Title II commodities.  This analysis shall be based on a comprehensive review of the nutritional needs of target beneficiaries in the context of total available dietary resources, including other enriched, blended and/or fortified foods and micronutrient supplements.  There are several elements to the process, including a rigorous scientific review of existing enrichment and fortification technologies, an active consultative process by industry, academic and operational experts, and the matching of these factors with the nutritional needs of P.L. 480 Title II beneficiary populations. 

USAID anticipates the award of a cost plus fixed fee completion contract for a two year base period with no options. The authorized geographic code for this requirement is 000.  Per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.201, USAID strongly encourages the participation of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small businesses in this activity as prime or subcontractors. 

The release of this notice does not obligate USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 (a) (2) (ii) to conduct a Market Research before soliciting offers for an acquisition with an estimated value in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and FAR Part 10.002 (b) (2)(iii) Publishing formal requests for information in appropriate technical or scientific journals or business publications.  The Governments intent, based on the information received from this RFI, is to make a determination whether to issue this Solicitation as a 100% small business set-aside or as a full and open competition.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of satisfying the Agencys requirements described herein.  Please note that this requirement is subject to the availability of funds.  Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The primary purpose of this notice is to improve small business access to acquisition information, to enhance competition, and to identify potential small businesses (for contracting and subcontracting opportunities) that are interested and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541720, Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities.  Firms responding to this RFI should state whether or not they are a small business concern, as defined by the Small Business Association.  The size standard for the NAICS 541720 is $6,500,000.00 per year in gross receipts.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this RFI.
BACKGROUND:	The United States Congress, through the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act and its subsequent amendments, requires the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to monitor and assess the impacts of resource development activities in federal waters on human, marine, and coastal environments.  The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 further requires that natural and social science research be conducted to inform decision-makers for major environmental policy actions.  The MMS is the federal administrative agency created both to conduct OCS lease sales and to monitor and mitigate adverse impacts that might be associated with offshore resource development.  Within the MMS, the Environmental Studies Program functions to implement and manage the responsibilities of research.  This study will facilitate the meeting of MMS information needs on subsistence food harvest and sharing activities in coastal Alaska, with specific focus on the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area.
The North Aleutian Basin (NAB) planning Area includes more than 50,000 square miles a large geographic area with diverse, abundant, and environmentally sensitive resources.  Within that area, the Department of Interiors Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012 considers an oil and gas lease sale for 2011.  The proposed sale area or adjacent areas support major productive commercial and subsistence fisheries, provide habitat to numerous marine mammals, and are a significant migration and staging area for internationally important waterfowl.  More than 20 communities in the Southwest Alaska-Bristol Bay area rely heavily on subsistence or commercial fisheries.  For example, Dutch Harbor is the largest seafood port in the world, processing a peak of 70 million pounds per week and collecting half the total US annual catch.  It would be difficult to identify an area in the Bering Sea, or possibly anywhere in the world, which has greater fisheries, protected species, or human use issues to assess prior to any proposed development action.
In November 2006, the MMS sponsored the North Aleutian Basin Information Status and Research Planning Meeting to solicit input from a broad range of scientific experts and regional stakeholders that could assist with the creation of jumpstart research planning strategies.  The meeting identified over 30 studies that could provide useful information for future Environmental Impact Statements, analysis of potential mitigation of impacts, and post-sale needs, such as for use in NEPA reviews of exploration or development plans.  Of those, this subsistence study has been identified by the Alaska OCS Region as meeting a highly time-sensitive and decision-applicable information need.
Subsistence is a major and sensitive component of the social and economic system of the NAB area.  Resident communities rely on the marine ecosystem for both fisheries employment and subsistence food harvest.  Subsistence activities are also widely recognized as an important mechanism for maintaining traditional values such as kinship, respect for elders, hospitality to visitors, sharing, and healthy living.  Thus, in rural Alaska, subsistence issues tend to dominate the public testimonial record.  Expressed comments amply demonstrate the continued importance of subsistence activities to coastal communities and the persistence of their concern over potential impacts from oil and gas development on social and cultural continuity, including changes associated with regional population growth, altered habitat, or diminished food security.  Of course, potential changes in the biogeography and productivity of commercial fish species are also major concerns for resident and non-resident groups that work in the Bering Sea fisheries.  Among resident groups, there is a clear positive relationship between involvement in subsistence and involvement in commercial fishing, indicating that these two pursuits are tightly integrated.
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: The goal of the study is to gather community and household-level data to help the MMS assess regional vulnerability to OCS oil development activities in Bristol Bay with regard to offshore subsistence resources.  Specifically, it will explore and document through both qualitative and quantitative field methods the complex social dynamics of subsistence food harvest and distribution for residents of Akutan, False Pass, Nelson Lagoon, and Port Heiden.  For each community, it will establish a baseline description of current subsistence harvest and distribution practices for keystone species that will include: seasonal harvest levels, seasonal harvest areas, social mapping of household distribution networks; and the identification of approximate ranges of variation across analytic categories.  The study will also seek to collect comparable data on major cash economic inputs and social network distributions where appropriate in each community. In addition to community level analysis, the MMS is interested in developing a regional scale analysis of how subsistence activities differ by variables such as geographical location, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and access to commercial opportunities.
The study goals will be accomplished through the following activities:  -Community Engagement: Establish formal contact with potential host communities and create a protocol to facilitate community participation and meaningful collaboration in the performance of this research;  -Literature Search: Conduct a focused literature search on the use of subsistence resources in each relevant community;  -Survey: Prepare a strategic survey instrument, pre-test it, and obtain necessary approvals to use it from relevant regulatory institutions (such as the US Office of Management and Budget); Conduct the survey with minimal burden to host communities;  -Ethnographic Fieldwork: Conduct supplementary ethnographic fieldwork to cross-validate collected survey data and to obtain the informant perspective necessary to interpret and explain survey results;  -Data Analysis: Organize all field data into a workable database and analyze it with appropriate multivariate statistical techniques; Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the results of all prior tasks and prepare a draft report of the study findings;  -Report Findings: Circulate the draft report to the MMS and host community leaders to facilitate parallel reviews by peer scientists and interested stakeholders; Respond to review comments and prepare a final report, incorporating reviewer edits and comments where appropriate; Report the study results to participating communities through public meetings or workshops.
STUDY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS:  Research personnel must possess extensive expertise in social science field work.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one or authorship in peer-reviewed publications.
SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a response of approximately 20-pages or less that provides information about the business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting projects of similar scope and complexity, and publications recorded in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked accordingly.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) efforts essential to identifying novel materials and processes that can provide potential breakthroughs in hydrogen storage and accelerate the adoption of these technologies by the military. On-board hydrogen storage is considered to be one of the most technically challenging barriers for the successful widespread commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies and subsequent reduction in U.S. petroleum imports. NSWC and DLA are coordinating hydrogen storage development efforts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energys hydrogen storage activities and the National Hydrogen Storage Project.  As the research and development progresses on solid-state and other advanced approaches for hydrogen storage, inter-agency efforts are coordinated to enable rapid prototype development and d! emonstration for a variety of relevant applications. Many DOD applications require hydrogen storage and generation systems to be situated in confined spaces or battlefield environments (dust, broad temperature range, sea salt atmosphere, etc.). The overarching objectives of this program are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) associated with advanced hydrogen storage approaches (including solid-state hydrogen storage materials and systems) and the integration of advanced hydrogen storage systems into vehicles.  Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
	The design, fabrication and demonstration of sub-scale prototype systems utilizing advanced hydrogen storage approaches for Defense applications (proposer shall specify application).  The advanced approaches may include, but are not limited to adsorbents (including the development and use of near-room temperature based doped sorbents), metal hydrides, chemical hydrides (liquids or solids) and advanced physical storage (e.g., cryo-compressed systems or novel concepts beyond conventional high pressure or cryogenic hydrogen tanks).  Storage systems should include all system components necessary for charge and discharge operation including thermal management, reactant flow control, humidification, etc., and that have the following characteristics:o	Storage capacity in the range from 0.1kg to less than 1kg of hydrogen (proposer shall specify)o	Maximum storage pressure of less than 350 atmospheres to be consistent with current 5,000 psi compressed gas infrastructure, preferably less than 200 atmospheres to avoid the requirement for 5,000 psi tank systemso	Moderate temperature of discharge (less than 150C)o	Discharge rate adequate to power fuel cell stack with between 0.5KW and 5KW peak power (proposer shall specify)o	Reversible approaches are preferred that allow rapid charging and discharging of hydrogen storage tanks with minimal waste disposal requirements.
	Prototype evaluation and documentation identifying: o	Potential environmental and safety issues, such as venting or gas leakage, related to the proposed technology.o	Operating performance such as kinetics of hydrogen charging and release and reproducibility of achieving net available hydrogen for specified applicationo	Operability over a range of temperature conditions and durabilityo	Performance and durability under exposure to contaminants encountered in military (combat zone) environmentso	Overall system gravimetric and volumetric energy capacity

NSWC Crane and DLA are interested in receiving proposals in the aforementioned areas.  Proposals may be basic research, applied research, or advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  However, in all cases, applicants should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 5-10 year timeframe, significant improvements to national security and military operations. 
This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR Part 6.102(d)(2). Proposals for initial contract awards are due no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time on 23 May 2008.  NSWC Crane encourages participation by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities. Proposals may be submitted by all types of applicants except other Federal agencies, federal laboratories and Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors. 
Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations. Multiple awards are anticipated.  The funding allocated to this program for all awards is planned at $1,500,000 for 2008 with any additional funding subject to appropriations.  Awards are expected to be between $500,000 and $1,500,000.  NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds. More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  
Prospective offerors are requested to submit questions in writing prior to LogR&D@navy.mil. Questions will be considered at any time prior to 2:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time on 21 May 2008. Responses to questions received will be posted as attachments and/or amendments to this BAA.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and will not be considered for funding. Proposals that are not within the topic areas described above will be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated. Proposals that demonstrate significant cost sharing by private sector or other government funding are strongly encouraged. All criteria as outlined in FAR 35.016 are applicable. Each proposal is limited to 20 pages including attachments and supplementary materials. Proposals shall include a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a cost estimate. Interested parties may submit more than one Proposal.  Proposals should clearly identify which concept area(s) they are responding to. Offerors should submit the proposals electronically with cost and technical proposals in separate files. Proposals will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria:a.	Overall relevance to the Department of Defense and the scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort;b.	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed and the comprehensiveness of the technical data produced from the proposed effort; c.	The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the organization or consortium with hydrogen implementations and the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these critical to achieving the BAA objectives; d.	The degree to which the proposed costs are reasonable and realistic and the quality, amount and extent of proposed cost share in the pilot programs.
These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price, but evaluated prices or costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible business may submit a proposal.   Please send proposals via e-mail to LogR&D@navy.mil. Please refer to BAA number N00164-08-R-GS29 in all correspondence and communications.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (“GSA”) Northeast and Caribbean Region is conducting a market survey and is seeking sources for General Construction, with constructability design review services.  The requirements for this opportunity include the Construction of a New United States Land Port of Entry (“LPOE”) at Alexandria Bay, New York.  The project will involve: 1) the Construction of 98,250 gsf. of buildings, and 2) the development of an expanded facility site.  This project is presently being designed by the firm of Morphosis Architects of Santa Monica, California. Construction is anticipated to begin February 2010 .   

The current estimated construction cost range is $100,000,000 to $135,000,000.  The estimated project construction duration is 39 months (1170 days).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 236220 and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard is $31 million in annual receipts averaged over a concern's latest three (3) completed fiscal years.  

The services for this project will include design and constructability reviews, value engineering, cost estimating, scheduling, and general construction services.  The project will require work to be performed immediately adjacent to the existing LPOE without any disruption to the operations of the existing facility.  The existing facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The facility elements include construction of the following: a new administration building, a new non-commercial secondary inspection building, a new cargo processing building, two (2) new non-intrusive inspection buildings, a new export building, 7 new split level booths and 7 new non-commercial level booths and associated canopies. All existing facility buildings and structures will be demolished as part of the project. The site work encompasses approximately 65 acres and requires work to be integrated with Interstate 81. The site geology is composed of metamorphosed igneous units and it is anticipated that there will be significant amounts of rock removal required in order to construct the project.

General Contractors interested in pursuing this opportunity should submit a letter of interest that includes the following information to Winnie Eng at winnie.eng@gsa.gov by April 30, 2008.  Ms. Eng can also be reached by calling 212-264-2575.

1. Provide the name of firm, a brief description of the firm’s capabilities and the contact information for the primary point of contact. 
2. Is your firm interested in submitting a proposal for the US LPOE at Alexandria Bay project based on the information provided?
3. Provide a brief narrative on three projects that you feel demonstrates your firm’s prior experience in providing similar general construction services and the ability to meet the described construction requirements. 
4. Would your firm bid the project on its own or as a part of a joint venture?  
5. Based upon the size standards provided, is your firm considered large or small?
6. If considered a small business, is your firm a women owned small business, small disadvantaged, veteran owned small, service disabled veteran owned, or HubZone small business concern?   
7. What is the current available bonding capacity of your firm and what is your firm’s anticipated available bonding capacity for Fall 2009?
8. If your firm is not interested in bidding on this project, please provide a brief explanation on why and what could be done to increase the likelihood of your firm’s participation [e.g. splitting the project into smaller phases or discrete work packages (rock removal / site / buildings)]? If split, which package would your firm be interested in?
9. Would you be interested in participating in a design assist arrangement where technically qualified construction firms would participate in design review (suggestions, recommendations, identification of issues, constructability, schedule, and cost estimating) throughout design development and construction document production, then submit firm fixed price proposals based on the final construction documents? 
10. Do you have any recommendations on packaging the request for proposal that would simplify the bidding process or make bidding the project more likely for your firm?

This system shall also electronically transmit, document, track, and manage workers’ compensation claims, medical case management, return-to-work activities, compensation payment processing, third party settlements, and verification of medical and compensation payments made by the Department of Labor (DOL), Employment Standards Administration (ESA), Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP) on behalf of TSA for employees who are injured or become ill in the workplace.

The system shall have the ability to securely exchange data with other systems, both internal to TSA/FAMS as well as external to the organization.  Internal TSA systems include a bi-weekly import of payroll data from the National Finance Center (NFC) maintained internally in the payroll office, and a bi-weekly import of personnel data from TSA’s Office of Human Capital.  External systems include daily, bi-weekly, monthly, and quarterly import/export processes with the DOL/ESA/OWCP systems to affect electronic filing of workers’ compensation claims, and retrieve detailed case management data.  The system shall have the capability to transmit and receive daily import/export data from MCA Innovations or like vendors responsible for medical case management processes.  Additionally, the system shall have the capability to transmit and receive, import and export quarterly and yearly data to and from the DOL Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) using X-12 EDI and secure File Transfer Protocol (sFTP). 

The system shall contain single-point, web-based, secure data entry so that a first report of an incident received by any entity such as the Nurse Case Manager (NCM), Workers’ Compensation Coordinator (WCC), or Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) specialist at an airport or FAMS facility may initiate a record in the system.  Like data elements from each type of report may be pre-populated to other entity-required documents and screens to eliminate the need for redundant data entry.  This ensures that each of the three entities managing investigations, injuries, illnesses, or medical case management activities have identical information to support the respective functions without compromising Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

The system shall include event-driven electronic notifications to each respective entity when predefined actions occur.  These near real-time notifications expedite any necessary actions from each entity.  More efficient electronic notification to the workers’ compensation and safety specialist allows for increased potential to meet timeliness requirements for filing workers’ compensation claims with OWCP (14 days), and documenting recordable incidents on the OSHA300 log within seven (7) calendar days.  Follow-up electronic notifications sent to the OSH specialist initiate review and possible update to the OSHA recordability for that case to ensure that the appropriate status is maintained.

TSA is required to follow certain disclosure guidelines for individual workers’ compensation case details.  Personnel and Payroll records are also protected from arbitrary disclosure.  The system shall contain enhanced security to ensure responsible data sharing, to include encryption of PII and Sensitive Security Information (SSI) data.  The system shall assign security profiles to user groups based on the user-group’s official ‘need to know’ specific information at the database table, column, and row levels.  

The system shall contain a workload management function that allows the NCM, WCC, and the OSH specialist to track and monitor key activities about incident investigations and workers’ compensation cases to ensure information is provided timely and case management activities are taken as appropriate.  The workload management function shall allow the WCC to maintain a virtual paperless shadow file within the system and track pending activities in the same manner as when creating tasks in Microsoft Outlook.  

The system shall include a series of standardized and custom program management reports that may be generated using all available data accessible from safety investigations, first notice injury reports to the NCM, and any OWCP case or billing information provided on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis.  The standard and custom reports will support any regulatory requirements, as well as DHS and TSA initiated performance metrics.

The system shall comply with all FISMA and DHS IT security requirements and receive a Certificate to Operate (CTO) from the DHS IT Security Certification and Accreditation process.  The vendor shall assign an Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) that will complete required processes to ensure that the system C&A is maintained and updated as necessary.  The system shall be compliant and usable under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  

Hosting and maintenance of the system shall include fully traceable customer support program provided to field users of the system.  Customer support services include modifying user accounts, resetting passwords, answering technical queries above and beyond application-specific issues; End-user error, configuring new workstations in support of the SIS application, developing specialized reports, managing data accuracy and quality assurance, and providing limited subject matter expertise for OSHA recordkeeping requirement.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (Geologic Division, Central Region) has a requirement for integration and installation of wind power systems at the Global Seismograph Network (GSN) Stations in Adak, Alaska (ADK) and Tristan da Cunha, South Atlantic (TRIS). Due to the harsh environment and extreme wind conditions at these stations that have destroyed multiple horizontal propeller type generators, USGS is specifying vertical axis (savonius) wind turbines (VAWT). For safety reasons a tall tower mount that is required for horizontal generators is not acceptable. The systems shall supply power for a seismic recording system at 120 watts 24 VDC load 24 hours/day.  The winds at ADK and TRIS can be sustained for days 6-15 meters/second and gusting much higher.  The systems shall be capable of hybridization with the existing DC power system and batteries. The systems shall be immune to the collection of hoar frost and the associated problems with blade balance. The systems shall have a lubrication system for long life assurance of mechanical parts. The systems shall be capable of disassembly for transportation to remote locations. Contractor shall furnish engineering drawings and Operation and Maintenance manuals for all equipment.  Contractor shall have at least proven 10 - 15 year experience with wind turbine generators that have been placed in North Sea, Antarctic, Sahara Desert and Pacific islands, known for the harsh environments.Required specifications:Output Voltage - 24 VDCOutput Current - 8 AmpsCut-in Wind speed - 3 m/secSustained wind speed - 16 m/sec or greaterPeak wind speed - 50 m/sec or greaterAxis type - Vertical (savonius)Immunity to ice accumulation - requiredShort mast mounting - desired for safety reasonsLubrication system - requiredHybridize with existing solar power system - requiredDrawings, and operation and maintenance manuals - requiredPortability to remote location - requiredMature product - requiredBased on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(l), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the specified supplies and services as a sole source procurement from Oy Windside Production Ltd, Finland, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, along with other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents WITHOUT accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

<DESC>Replacement of the HU-25, 5KVA AC Generator P/N 81634-2.
The Coast Guard at the present time has twenty one HU-25 aircraft in service.  The secondary AC power source for these aircraft is the 5 KVA generator, P/N 81634-2, manufactured by Electro Kinetics Corporation.  The 5 KVA generator provides 115 volts (V) alternating current (AC) three phase 400 cycles (Hz) to the aircraft.  The 5 KVA generator is driven by the aircraft’s Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) 2G-GTCP36-100(C).  The Coast Guard has been experiencing supportability problems with the present generator.  It is the intention to replace the current 5 KVA generator with a generator rated at 8KVA minimum.
The Coast Guard is seeking industry comment from potential sources that can provide a replacement 8 KVA generator which will generate clean MIL-STD-704 Alternating Current (AC) electrical power on its fleet of HU-25 Aircraft.   The current generator assembly is a brushless generator, self-cooled with an internal permanent magnet generator (PMG) and current transformer.  The current 5 KVA generator is connected to the Auxiliary Power Unit’s (APU) mechanical drive by a flexible quill shaft and driven at 12,000 RPM.  Shaft rotation is CW facing the shaft.  The generator is used in conjunction with a Generator Control Unit (GCU) and a current transformer (CT) which comprises the 5 KVA auxiliary power system.  The replacement generator shall fit the same envelope when installed on the APU.  Commercial off the shelf is preferred, but not required.
The purpose of this synopsis is to determine possible sources for 8 KVA AC Generator system replacements.  Organizations that are Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified having the required expertise, capabilities, and an acceptable quality system are invited to submit complete technical information packages including a planning estimate.  Responses and comments do not constitute a proposal, but rather, will be considered as an open exchange of capabilities and ideas.  The information contained therein shall pertain to this synopsis only.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information received.  Any interested organizations must submit their data in writing within 30 days of this announcement to Mr. J. J. Tirak at the address given above.  The Coast Guard’s point of contacts are CWO Roger Cerny at (252) 335-6310 (email: roger.s.cerny@uscg.mil)  Mr. J. J. Tirak at (252) 335-6877 (email: james.j.tirak@uscg.mil )or FAX (252) 334-5424.

<DESC><p>This notice provides additional information regarding inquires submitted under RFP 2008-N-10230, titled Animal Care and Labware/Laundry Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 1: Are there any existing Inter/Interagency agreements that are doing work within the scope of the PWS/Solicitation? If so, which ones and please provide a copy of each agreement.</p>
<p>Response to Question 1: The information can be obtained by contacting the CDC FOIA Office.</p>
<p>Question 2: Please provide a copy of each existing contract doing work within the scope of the PWS/Solicitation. (e.g., Amirtech, Priority One, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Are any of these existing contracts being renegotiated by the CDC outside the priority of the MEO or are those that are expiring merely being extended through the end of the A-76 solicitation period so that the MEO Team can negotiate its own partnering agreement with an MEO subcontract?</p>
<p>Response to Question 2: The information can be obtained by contacting the CDC FOIA Office.</p>
<p>Question 3: With regard to HAZWOPER training, Section C-5.7.2 of the PWS, please clarify whether the PWS workload count of 8 refers to 8 eight-hour refresher courses or 8 persons receiving 40 hours of initial training? Please identify which functions require this training?</p>
<p>Response to Question 3: The requirement is to designate eight (8) employees and provide them with OHS Hazardous Waste and Material Training. The initial training is 40 hours. The eight employees are then required to take an eight hour refresher class each year thereafter. There must be at least 8 employees trained at all times.</p>
<p>Question 4: With regard to Section C-5.9.1, please clarify if this requirement is still included as a valid component of this PWS?</p>
<p>Response to Question 4: The following requirements were removed form the final PWS Draft: C-5.9.1; C-5.9.2; C-5.9.3; and C-5.9.4</p>
<p>Question 5: How does Section C-4.16, Description of the Roybal Animal Care Operations within Solicitation #2008-N-09689, Animal Services, currently on FedBizOpps, released January 22, 2008, differ from the services required in Solicitation 20008-N-10230? (Outside of Labware and Laundry Services.)</p>
<p>Response to Question 5: Solicitation #2008-N-10230 was posted on FebBizOpps as required by the Animal Care and Labware/Laundry Services A76 study. Solicitation #2008-N-09689 is not a part of the study and was not posted by the Animal Care and Labware/Laundry Services Performance Work Statement (PWS) Team. Therefore, the PWS Team has no technical knowledge of Solicitation #2008-N-09689.</p>
<p>Question 6: With regard to Section C-5.2.1 thru C-5.2.6, please identify how many cages are being used to house the quantities of animals/species. The PWS specifies the workload title and frequency in terms of quantities of animals/species does not correlate to the description of the work which involves cage washing. The workload count needs to be revised and specified in terms of numbers of cages.</p>
<p>Response to Question 6: The number of cages depends on the number of animals housed in accordance with the PI's requirements. For example, the PI may require 5 mice per cage opposed to 10 or 15. Five mice per cage will produce more cages than 10 or 15 mice per cage. The animal census data represents the best estimate of the total number of animals housed for each performance period.</p>
<p>Question 7: For Sections C-5.1.10 and C-5.1.15, please revise the PWS workload titles and frequencies to reflect the type of medical treatment rather than type of animal or species. The current PWS specifies workload title and frequency in terms that do no correlate to the description of the work requirements, which are medicated treatment(s).</p>
<p>Response to Question 7: The requirement is to perform medical treatment on animals as directed by the AV, not to perform a certain number of medical treatments by type. We don't know what those treatments will be until directed by the AV. However, the treatment type must be documented.</p>
<p>Question 8: Please provide the MEO team with a current listing of all affected employees. There seems to have been a change from the number of employees included in the Public Announcement, specifically within the functional area of autoclave.</p>
<p>Response to Question 8: The total number of affected employees has been reduced from 33 to 27.</p>

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE AWARD VIA EXTENSION OF CURRENT CONTRACT:

It is imperative that a sole source award be extended to Raytheon Corporation through the current contract, SPM500-05-D-BP22, until a successor contract is ready to award (SPM7LX-07-R-0084).  

This sole source award was initiated to ensure continued coverage and support for the Army Customer Sites while awaiting the award of the Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) and Red River Army Depot (RRAD) Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) successor contract initiative.  The contract is a long-term contract, currently in its third and final year.  All NSNs are available through the primary point of contact, Stephen Heath. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.  The existing IPV contract provides integrated product support for line-side delivery of replenishment spare parts and related industrial hardware requirement for the maintenance/production lines at Anniston Army Depot and Red River Army Depot (ANAD and RRAD).  Under the existing IPV contract 12,875 NSNs are supported, with approximately 75% of the NSNs being supplied by the Government to IPV contractor for integrated support management.  The remaining NSNs are managed and sourced by the IPV contractor.  It would be in the Governments best interest if this contract was extended from July 27, 2008 through January 26, 2009.

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:douglas.baptist@hq.doe.gov">Douglas Baptist, Contract Officer</a>
<DESC>The transition to the Department's electronic procurement system wasinitiatedon April 7, 2008. The system will be implemented in a cascading approach;implementing one contracting office after another. If you are a currentcontractor or financial assistance recipient conducting business with theOffice of Headquarters Procurement Services whose main office is located inWashington, DC, it is imperative that you complete the registrationsdiscussedbelow as soon as possible. The Office of Headquarters Procurement Serviceswillbegin conducting transactions in the new system on or about April 14, 2008.The Department of Energy (the Department), including the National NuclearSecurity Administration (NNSA), will implement the Strategic IntegratedProcurement Enterprise System (STRIPES) during fiscal years 2008 and 2009.As aresult, the Department will begin using FedConnect, which is hosted byCompusearch, as the communications portal for its potential and actualcontractor and financial assistance recipient communities (entities)beginningin March 2008 instead of the current system (IIPS). Therefore, in order todobusiness with the Department, all current and potential acquisition andfinancial assistance awardees must be registered with the CompusearchFedConnect portal.Notices and solicitations, required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR), will continue to be sent to FedBizOpps (FBO), with additionalinformation available to interested entities on the Compusearch FedConnectportal. Similarly, financial opportunity announcements that must bepublishedon Grants.gov will continue to be transmitted there also, with additionalinformation provided at the FedConnect portal. The FedConnect portal willbeused throughout the lifecycle of the acquisition and financial assistanceinstruments issued by the Department from the presolicitation/planningphase toinstrument close-out. The Departments STRIPES will communicate withexternalentities via FedConnect on matters related to acquisition or financialsolicitation or award actions.We are advising current and potential contractors and financial assistancerecipients to register with FedConnect at your earliest convenience athttps://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ . Please note FedConnect is used bymultiple federal agencies and therefore, assistance with FedConnect will beprovided by Compusearch, not the Department of Energy. Contact informationisbe provided on the FedConnect web site athttps://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/If you need assistance registering with FedConnect, you may contactSupport@fedconnect.netIn addition, we are recommending that all organizations that want to dobusiness with the Department of Energy register with the Central ContractorRegistration (CCR), even those who are not required to be registered by theFederal Acquisition Regulation as this facilitates registration onFedConnect.In general, the system functionality of FedConnect requires that allorganization be registered with the CCR, before registering withFedConnect.The Department is promoting this approach, since it will makecommunicationsbetween the Department and organizations doing business with the Departmentmore integrated, faster, and auditable.However, in the rare instance where your organization is not required byacquisition and/or financial assistance regulations to be registered withtheCCR and CCR registration is not practicable, please contact theDepartmentsHelp Desk at 800-683-0751 for assistance with FedConnect registration.Additional information or comments regarding this matter may be submittedviaemail to STRIPES@hq.doe.gov .

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for 500 each Stainless Steel In-Line Particulate Filterswith Swagelok tube fittings and 1000 each 440 Micron Mesh.  The delivery is required byJune 30, 2008.	 NASA/ARC intends to purchase these items from Swagelok Sunnyvale, located at 929 WeddelCt., Sunnyvale, California, 94089, because they are the sole-proprietary manufacture ofthe requested filters.	These are Stainless Steel In-Line Particulate Filter, 440 micronmesh, with Swagelok tube fittings, which will be used in the Arc Jet Complex.  Therequested filters are the only filters that come stock with Swagelok fittings, thusrequiring no additional fitting conversions.  Swagelok is a proprietary feral-compression fitting that cannot be interchanged withother types of feral-compression fittings.The Stainless Steel In-Line particulate filters need to have Swagelok fittings thatconsist of a nut, furral, gland that is not interchangeable with other manufactures ofswaged fittings and need to meet the following requirements:	 Inline design required due to space limitations 	 Connect to 3/8 hose	 Working pressure of system - 1200 [psi]	 Swagelok or 37-AN fittings required to mate-up to 	 existing hoses	 Fast field change of filter element required (i.e. hose 	 to remain in place)	 Variable filter (strainer or sintered) size, currently 	 requesting 440 [m]The filters will be used on the de-ionized cooling water system of the InteractionHeating Facility (IHF).   With the installation of a new high pressure pumping system forthe IHF and water passages decreased in size to increase velocity/cooling in the archeater column, particulate contamination of the cooling system has become an issue. These filters will strain the de-ionized water system of particulates thus preventing thecooling water passages in the arc heater column from getting blocked.  This will preventarc heater failure due to segment overheating.	 Currently the cooling water passagesvary in size from .055 [inches] to .070 [inches].  There are approximately 450 de-ionizedcooling water supply lines feeding the heater, each of which requires an in-line filter.Offers for the items(s) described above are due by 4:00PM PDT, April 18, 2008, and mustinclude solicitation number, NNA08236903-AMK-1, by any of the following: mailed to NASA Ames Research Center, Attn:Mr. Kevin Sasur, Mail-Stop 227-4, Building 227, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000; or e-mailedto Kevin.J.Sasur@nasa.gov and must include: FOB destination to this Center, proposedschedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayeridentification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and besigned by an authorized company representative. Offerors are encouraged to use theStandard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at URL:http://server-mpo.arc.nasa.gov/Services/NEFS/NEFSHome.tml   Oral communications are not acceptable in repose to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate Firewall devices as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet . The equipment listed above is required to replace existing equipment that has reached the end of its life cycle. The Stonegate Firewall devices will continue to aid in the process of filtering out harmful web contenc and/or malicious code on the Department of State's mission critical operating environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.

Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

Justification for approved ENM ITCCB BAR 08039, ADoV MDOP Licenses (IT Consolidation).The IRM/OPS/ENM is requisition authorization to procure Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack software licenses for domestic Vista Deployment. The 41 USC 253(C)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.ADoV project was approved in December 2007, based on a Trade study conducted in the Summer of CY 2007.  The results of the trade study recommended the MDOP tool as uniquely suited to address Department of State requirements for improved desktop lifecycle management. Microsoft resellers are the exclusive source of the MDOP tools, and the contract holder of the Microsoft Enterprise Agreement is the sole source of licenses for MDOP in terms less than three years. Funding for the software licenses and first year maintenance are required to support IT Consolidated automated desktop deployment to Windows Vista in the Summer for 2008.Microsoft not only has the ITCCB authorized software but has supplied it in the past and is familiar with the requirements. Microsoft not only has the ITCCV authorized software but has supplied it in the past and is familiar with the requirements  Research has been conducted and it has been determined that acquiring the Microsoft products are the most cost effective means to meet the DoS support requirements.In addition, SOE-DD trade study identifying requirements and MDOP solution, are described in the attached SOE-DD Trade Study document, titled SOE-DD Trade Study-IRM-OPS-ENM-NED-EMS-RPT35.01.00.doc. Microsoft is the only manufacturer of product.  Product was selected through SOE-DD Trade Study conducted by ENM in Summer of 2007.  I Contacted the product vendor and several resellers of the product to identify purchasing options.  Several resellers offered the volume required and satisfactory pricing, but the term at which they offered the product (three years) tripled the overall cost of the product. Only the holder of the Departments Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft was able to offer the product at a term less than three years.  This term of twelve months was inline with our available budget for the product.<BR><BR>

<p>08 Apr 2008</p>
<p><br />MEMORANDUM FOR BRAND NAME PURCHASE</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Brand &amp; Model Specific Purchase</p>
<p>1. This Brand Name requirement is for purchase of Globe brand "GXTREME" jackets (model number 31882E) and Globe brand "GXTREME" pants (model number 41882E) for the Aviano AB Fire Department. The following characteristics of the jackets and pants are essential to their firefighting duties: PBI aluminized 7 ounce shell, Aralite quilt thermal liner, Stedair moisture barrier, aluminized reinforced elbows and knees, Arashield cuff reinforcements, PBI hand &amp; wrist guards, 3" x 3.5" x 9" radio pocket, snap on tabs at the hem line, the Drag Rescue Device, and the item's meet National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) standard 1971, 2007 edition.</p>
<p>2. Current inventory consists of 30 pairs of these protective ensembles. Several that are worn beyond serviceability need to be replaced with matching products. Replacement with another product will cause improperly matched ensemble, leaving firefighters susceptible to injury and burns. Additionally we currently have replacement suspenders, liners, and knee and elbow pads for this gear allowing us to replace parts of worn outfits. Purchase of a different brand of protective equipment, would require additional money to ensure proper bench stock for replacement, and repair of the new suits. For these reasons it is in the best interest of the Government to purchase the aforementioned brand name supplies.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question relating to the intended use of the fuel cell system.

The question posed is as follows:  "Would you be able to tell us what the fuel system would be providing back up power for?  What type of system(s) you would be backing up, the building's (lab's) electrical power or are they testing to backup some other power supply?"

The answer to the question is as follows:  "The fuel cell system will be the subject of the laboratory tests.  It will not actually be backing up any equipment, but it will be operated to backup a load that will be simulated with a programmable DC load bank.  The DC load bank’s capacity is 6000 Watts, nominally."

All terms and conditions of the solicitation, including the response date of April 17, 2008, remain unchanged.

Ent Ave, Ste 105, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1385. Description: This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization Systems (PARCS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 01 Apr 2007 and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection. The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for a geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the PARCS field station located at Cavalier AFS North Dakota. The PARCS provides 24-hour per-day missile warning and space surveillance coverage. Detects, tracks and reports via data link, real-time earth-impacting objects to the Missile Warning Center or its alternate. Provides, via data link, real-time metric observations and Space Object Identification (SOI) on tasked earth-orbiting objects to the Space Control Center, or its alternate, and the 1st Space Control Squadron (1SPCS). The PARCS has been identified as a critical defense system and therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis. Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor's personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil.

<DESC><p>The Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office, Kirtland AFB, NM will be interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in responsive launch, range and system architecture and modeling technologies. The ORS Office is looking for innovative solutions to launch vehicles and range operations that support meeting the ORS 2015 goals in performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability, affordability, or which enhance performance or significantly reduce cost, schedule, or technical risk in the areas of interest that enable operationally responsive space access. Specific areas of focus for launch and range enablers are: - What can be done to enhance our current launch capability and range operations to meet ORS objectives? - What are concepts for future capability that can be more responsive to ORS launch and range requirements? The ORS office is looking for innovative approaches to conduct ORS 2015 conceptual end state architecture modeling, simulation and analysis and Tier-1 experimentation and demonstrations. The BAA, once released, will give full detail and expectations for successful bidders. The ORS Office tentatively plans to host a Bidder?s Conference in Albuquerque NM on 13-14 February 2008. Specifics of the meeting will be available when the draft BAA is published in the immediate future.

<p>1. On page 10 Contracting Points of Contact make the following changes:</p>
<p>a.) Change the phone number for Capt Wodochek</p>
<p>FROM: (505) 846-7197</p>

<p>Contract Specialist: James (Jim) Swartz, SDTW/PK, (505) 846-7878, james.swartz@kirtland.af.mil</p>
<p>2. The following is a clarification of "SWIR" and associated passive cooling.</p>
<p>There have been a number of questions as to the definition of "SWIR" and how<br />far into the infrared would the ORS like the system to go.</p>
<p>Generally, SWIR implies 1 micron to 3 microns in wavelength. The ORS Office would like proposers to consider possible solutions out to 5 microns, if possible.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, some active cooling approach might be required. A<br />thermal electric cooling option can be considered, since it has no moving parts. Cryo-coolers can be proposed, but, cost, schedule and jitter should<br />be considered.</p>
<p>This clarification can result in increased complexity to the options<br />proposed, but, in proposing an option that can achieve 5 microns, either a<br />single sensor or multiple replacement sensors can be proposed.</p>
<p>Contact Dr. Mark Franz, Operationally Responsive Space Office, 3548 Aberdeen Ave SE, Bldg 382, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117. Phone: (505) 853-2469, DSN: 263-2469, for additional clarification.</p>
<p><br />3. Clarification: Reference page 17, Section III, Additional Information, Volume II, Cost Proposal - {No Page Limit}, paragraph 1(c):</p>
<p>Change paragraph 1(c) to read: If you are submitting a proposal, other than a Firm Fixed Price proposal, you must submit a copy of your cost proposal to your cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office upon submission of your cost proposal.</p>
<p>4. Clarification: Reference page count information for BAA 03: The correct page count limit for BAA 03 is 32 pages as originally stated and is not limited to 25 pages as printed in the previous amendment. In addition, a reminder, Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) information is not included in the page count limits.</p>

<DESC><p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of Microtechnologies for Air-Cooled Exchangers (MACE).   The primary goal of this program is the development and demonstration of air-cooled exchangers that offer significant reductions in thermal resistance (from case to air) and significant reductions in the total electrical power used to force the air through the system.  Possible approaches to these program goals could include the development of innovative concepts for modification of the airflow through the exchanger, such as with synthetic jets, moving mechanical structures, or surfaces that offer enhanced convective heat transfer.  Approaches that improve the thermal conduction from the base to all the surfaces of the exchanger are also likely to be important.  Approaches that reduce the airflow resistance of the exchanger so that the blower can operate at lower power are of interest.  Approaches that improve the efficiency of the blower are also of interest.  DARPA is interested in approaches that utilize combinations of enhanced convection and conduction in addition to reduced airflow resistance and improved blower efficiency, or any subset thereof that can meet the program requirements.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  Proposal abstracts are due no later than 12 March 2008.  Full proposals are due no later than <strong>21 May 2008.</strong> See attached BAA 08-15 solicitation document dtd 8 January 2008, <strong>as amended 9 April 2008.</strong></p>

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Departments networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/IIs KCC project needs. The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives Systems must have front video/USB ports Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The requested HP server fulfills the following critical requirements: The server must utilize Intels quad-core 5400 series processors that generate no more than 80 watt of heat. The processors shall operate at a minimum of 3.0GHz and employ a 1333 MHz FSB. There are Intel quad-core processors that generate 100 and 120 watts, but they exceed our maximum heat threshold. Note: If Intels 50 watt Quad Core processors are available at the time of purchase, then the 50 watt processor will supersede our original 80 watt requirement, and be the preferred choice. The server form factor must not be greater than 2U The server must support a minimum of (8) internal 2.5 inch SAS hard drives Servers must be configured with 16Gb of memory and have the ability to expand to 32Gb without discarding original memory Server power supplies must be rated by the manufacture at a minimum of 800 watts. The vendor must be able to provide emergency maintenance within a 4-hour response time, 24/7CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that these most closely met the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers server configurations or to manage multiple vendors yearly support and maintenance agreements.The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline. The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.(5) A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated<BR><BR>A)Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Duplicate listing of FDA1041798

Requisition Number: FDA1041798

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order on a non-competitive sole source basis to Biomerieux, Inc., 100 Rodolphe St., Durham, NC 27712-9402.  FDA will purchase the following: 
24 boxes of ICS Assay kits #30435
24 boxes of ICS Broth #42610
24 boxes of SLM #30702
29 boxes of API 20E Kit #20100
24 boxes of VP-1 and Vp-2 #70422
48 boxes of VIDAS Staph Enterotoxin SET2 #30705
The purpose of the various kits or reagents is to develop methods used for training and the detection of foodborne contaminates which maybe a result of acts of terrorism or natural occurring events that effect our nation’s food source.  The knowledge and information obtained regarding this method for detecting foodborne disease and associated phenomena will enhance FDA’s ability to protect and enhance the safety of the food supply.  Biomerieux Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the Vidas test kits and supplies and accessories.   Center for Disease Control (CDC) has approved no other method for the detection program submitted by FDA under the select agent registered program and there are no potential substitutes.  No other vendors that can provide the capability required for FDA’s research program.  There are no approved substitutes and there are no similar instruments.  In addition, the methods used in the detection program make reproducibility and ease of use the “gold standard”, and this can only be conducted using known and proven methods that have been approved by CDC for all labs in the USA to measure and detect microbial phenotypes.  As the only known standard kits capable of providing the capability necessary, the Biomerieux test kit provides uniformity with the de facto international standard for research and rapid response.  To select any other kits and reagents would place FDA research in this area out of step with the research community and would reduce both the capability and credibility of research in this critical scientific arena.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the Agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All inquiries must be received by 10:00 AM (1000) EST on 23 April 2008 to the attention of David Kordel, david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice. The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<SUBJECT>Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Echocardiography Reading Center – Market Research
<SOLNBR>SSA-NHLBI-HC-09-08
<RESPDATE>042208
<CONTACT>CherylJennings, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-0347, Fax (301) 480-3430, Email cj19f@nih.gov - Jeffrey A Williams, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-0338, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email williamsja2@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>	The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) plans to negotiate on a competitive basis to award an Echocardiography Reading Center (Echo RC) contract as part of the renewal of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The CARDIA renewal involves a Year 25 clinical examination (Year 25 Exam) of the cohort that includes repeat and new measures to be performed June 2010 through May 2011; and continued follow-up contact and clinical events surveillance of the cohort through September 30, 2013. The Echo RC’s effort is expected to begin on March 1, 2009 and to end September 30, 2013. The CARDIA Echo RC contractor will be responsible for the various aspects related to the echocardiographic measurements to be collected and assessed in the Year 25 Exam.
	
	The CARDIA Study started as a study of the distribution and evolution of risk factors for cardiovascular disease during young adulthood in black and white men and women.  The Study began recruitment in 1985 and has completed 7 examinations over 20 years in a cohort of 5,115 men and women aged 18-30 years in four communities.  The original cohort had approximately equal representation by blacks and whites, men and women, those aged 18-24 and 25-30 years, and those with no more than a high school education.  The baseline examination (Year 0) was conducted over a 14-month period during 1985-86.  The examination consisted of questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and psychological factors; an exercise treadmill test; resting electrocardiography; a diet history assessment; anthropometry; pulmonary function testing; resting blood pressure; and fasting blood measurements.  Six additional examinations have been completed every 2-5 years, including most recently a Year 20 examination completed in 2006.  Retention of the surviving cohort was 90, 86, 81, 79, 74, and 72 percent at each of the respective follow-up examinations. Repeat measurements on several traditional risk factors have used the same methods at each examination to assess age and secular trends in these factors during young adulthood.  In selected years, additional measurements have been made, including echocardiography at Year 5 (in nearly the full cohort) and Year 10 (in a subset of the cohort).  
	
	At the Year 25 Exam (to be conducted from June 2010 through May 2011), participants will be 43-55 years old, when risk factors and subclinical abnormalities become more prevalent and clinical events begin to emerge.  CARDIA offers the opportunity to address aspects of the development and progression of subclinical vascular, ventricular, and pulmonary function abnormalities that cannot be addressed in older cohorts.  The renewal of the CARDIA study will address five objectives: 1) Assess the impact of timing and varying levels of risk factors throughout young adulthood on the development of subclinical ventricular, vascular, and pulmonary function abnormalities in mid-life; 2) Examine young adult antecedents and consequences of obesity and the longitudinal relationships and interactions among adiposity, insulin resistance, and inflammation; 3) Identify determinants and trajectories of subclinical disease development in women during menopause transition compared to men of similar age; 4) Further assess the basis for racial differences in subclinical disease development; 5) Provide a platform for in-depth ancillary studies in cardiovascular and other areas.
	
The technical requirements associated with this acquisition for the CARDIA Echo RC include the following:

1.	Develop the protocol for the acquisition, reading, and information abstraction of the echocardiograms to be performed as part of the CARDIA Year 25 Exam.  As much as feasible, the protocol shall aim to be comparable to the echocardiographic examination performed during the Year 5 Exam.

2.	Determine comparability of the proposed echocardiographic protocol for the Year 25 Exam to that for the Year 5 Exam by performing repeat measures of a subset of videotaped echocardiograms and 10% blind duplicated measures of studies from the Year 5 Exam.

3.	Convert the videotaped echocardiograms from the CARDIA Year 5 and Year 10 Exams into digital electronic files and copy onto disks for secure archival storage.

<DESC>This is a retransmission of a synopsis modification that was originally posted on or about 1 April 2008.
The purpose of this modification is to revise the original synopsis that was posted on or about 21 Mar 2008.  See below for the revised synopsis.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source contract to Creare Incorporated for the acquisition of engineering services to produce a Chemical/Biological Agent Resistance Test (CBART) test fixture.  The CBART test fixture will be used to test candidate materials for the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit (JSLIST), an ACAT III program.  The performance of the prototypes will be validated at two test centers, (i.e. Dugway and Battelle) with two rounds of prototyping at each center.  The CBART program was established to address capability shortfalls with current protective materials testing methods established by the Aerosol-Vapor-Liquid Assessment Group (AVLAG).  New test methods/equipment are required to adequately evaluate modern protective materials and provide individual protection equipment developers with the information needed to evaluate performance of components of their products.  
Creare Incorporated is the only company that can provide this support for the following reasons.   Currently, the AVLAG cell is used for assessing the penetration resistance of individual protective (IP) garments against various chemical agents.  The AVLAG cell and system has evolved over years, but a number of drawbacks remain, including significant uncertainties in the resulting data, inefficiency and expense, risk to test personnel, and a limited range of test conditions.   Creare Incorporated is the only companythat has provided a concept for the new CBART cell.  The intent is to enable consistent testing of all material types, reduce uncertainties in measurements, increase realism and range of test conditions, and utilize automation to improve efficiency and personnel safety.
Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, there are no other sources that can satisfy this requirement. Interested firms must request the solicitation in writing or via e-mail to Contract Specialist: Nicole Anderson, Code XPS2, NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407, e-mail nicole.a.anderson1@navy.mil.  Requests should include the prospective offeror's Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, physical mailing address, email address, point of contact and telephone number. Telephone requests will not be accepted. FSC Code: AN14 NAICS Code: 541711, Size Standard: 500.  The award will be based on an acceptable proposal on or about 21 Jun 2008.

<DESC>The US Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Peru intends to seek proposals from qualified U.S. and local organizations interested in providing services to strengthen counternarcotics policies and related institutions in Peru.  The activity will work to create a critical mass of public and civil society actors who are well-informed on counternarcotics-related issues and who can help advance policy that furthers GOP and USG objectives of controlling illicit coca and promoting integrated licit development in coca growing regions.  The objectives will be achieved through three primary areas of intervention:
a) Build a core critical mass of public and civil society leaders (in Lima and in regions) able to engage meaningfully in counternarcotics policy formulations and debates.

b) Provide technical assistance to key Ministries, members of Congress, and other government actors on policy formulation.

c) Strengthen DEVIDA so that it can successfully perform its role in coordinating counternarcotics policies and programs.

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of U.S. or local organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. 

Offerors are advised that funds are not yet available for award at this time and that contract award is also subject to the approval of Mission Operational Plans. This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred  in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>CBD Notice posted on February 25, 2008, amended on March 17, 2008, March 25,2008 and on March 31, 2008.   This amendment changes the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) issuance date from on or about April 9, 2008 to on or about April 16, 2008.  This amendment includes the solicitation number to be used in conjunction with the procurement request number as follows:  WPJ-08-0289/GS-11P-08-YT-C-0173.  Please reference this number when requesting procurement documents, drawings and or questions regarding the solicitation.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public architecture, engineering, and construction through a Design-Build / Bridging delivery method.      

GSA intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price Design-Build contract for all design and construction services necessary for Site Utility Upgrades – 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System located at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, 3801 Nebraska Avenue, NW,  Washington, DC, Procurement Request Number WPJ-08-0289.  The Site Utility Upgrades – 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System is a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.   

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur on or before December 29, 2010.  The anticipated cost for the project is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000, and will consist of a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.  

The proposed site covers approximately 25 acres, bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Rock Creek, and private property.   The scope of the project is to provide a three feeder spot network electrical system including utility metering switchgear, underground distribution, underground vaults and connections to the existing buildings. Critical programmatic requirements include the need to keep the existing buildings in operation until the new system is complete.  

The design-build scope of work includes all engineering, civil, architectural /structural, design, construction, and other related services necessary to design and to construct the electrical distribution system.  Related services include, but are not limited to, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional geotechnical analysis of the site.  Preliminary approvals have been secured from National Capital Planning Commission for the current design. Additional submissions will be required to secure final approvals.

This project requires the construction of a new primary electrical system including underground utility metering vault, duct banks, underground network transformer vaults, connection to existing electrical systems and removal of the existing electrical system, including salvage of designated equipment at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, together with associated mechanical, electrical and general construction work. Work includes selective demolition of existing electrical system and storm water system, and provision of underground electrical substation vaults, electrical distribution system, spot network substations, including transformers and switchgear, medium voltage metering switchgear and cabling, PEPCO connections, switchboards, connections to existing electrical system, temporary wiring, excavation and backfill and surface restoration and incidental related work. The Contractor shall provide the services of Registered Professional Engineers and Architects, experienced in the type of work contemplated, to provide design, calculations, field survey, drawings and specifications covering the work. Disciplines anticipated include electrical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, and horticulture.

The Contractor shall provide all the necessary labor, materials, supervision, management, quality control plan and testing to produce a finished and operational electrical system conforming to the contract documents.

The completed project will meet or exceed all Federal design and construction statutes, standards, and regulations, including but not limited to the energy goals stated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection measures.  

Interested Offerors must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size; or, which has similar projects currently in construction.

The design of the engineering and architectural features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by engineers and architects registered to practice in their particular field within the District of Columbia.  The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractor’s personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFQ AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  In accordance with the requirements of the RFQ, Phase 1 proposals shall be submitted approximately April 25, 2008, by 1:00 PM, EST, to the following address: GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPP) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407.

<DESC>The US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a Request For Information (RFI) for White Papers on methods to develop Cargo Parachute Releases to replace or modify the M-1 and M-2 Cargo Parachute Releases so as to provide a more reliable, lower maintenance, lower weight, and lower cost release.  The releases must be capable of automatically releasing the parachutes from the cargo upon ground impact regardless of ground wind conditions (21knots objective, 17 Knots threshold) and payload orientation.  The new Cargo Parachute Releases, used with either a single or clustered parachute configuration, shall have the following performance characteristics: capable of delivering combat loads having suspended weights between 2,200 through 25,000 pounds (objective) (2,200 through 15,500 pounds (threshold)) for M-1 replacement; and 15,000 through 60,000 pounds (objective) (15,000 through 42,000 pounds (threshold)) for M-2 replacement; capable of withstanding the forces typically associated with operations from military cargo aircraft traveling between 130-150 knots indicated air speed (KIAS); provide a successful airdrop completion rate of 92 percent without a system abort; capable of being used and stored in all climatic categories (hot, basic, cold, severe cold) as defined in Army Regulation (AR) 70-38.  <BR><BR>All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to submit a White Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement07-09 which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ssbaa.htm.

<DESC>The Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site launched a new system on 1 April 2008.  Subsequently, the interested vendors list (IVL) for this Presolicitation Notice was not carried over from the old FBO system to the new one.  Therefore, it is anticipated that if any vendor registered in the IVL for this notice under the old system, they will not be notified from the new FBO system when the solicitation is posted.  It is suggested that any vendors interested in this requirement register in the IVL for this Presolicitation Notice within the new system to ensure notification when the solicitation is posted.  THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE.  The synopsis remains unchanged.  The points of contact are Becky.Veliz@amedd.army.mil, Contract Specialist, (210) 221-3191 and Pamela.Owens1@amedd.army.mil, Contracting Officer, (210) 221-4640.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns (SDVOSB) or Small Business Concerns.  The estimated value of this procurement is between $500,000,00 and $1,000,000.00.  Performance time is 60 calendar days.  The applicable North American Industry Class System (NAICS) code is 237990 Dredging.  The small business size standard is a three-year averaged annual gross receipt of $17.0 million.  Bid, payment and performance bonds are required. The solicitation in its entirety and any amendments will be available at no charge online at http://www.fbo.gov under the above solicitation number.  The project work consists of dredging and disposing of approximately 5,000 cubic yards of accumulated river deposits and riprap rocks from shoreline area approximately 290 ft. by 11 ft, and shoreline stabilization of dredging area’s restructured side slopes utilizing approximately 3,252 cubic yards of riprap. The contractor shall be limited to the use of the southern end of the floating barge to perform work.
