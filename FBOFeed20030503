<DESC>NA CLASSCOD: Z--Maintenance, Repair or Alteration of Real Property OFFADD: USPFO for Massachusetts, Contracting Office, 50 Maple Street, Milford, MA 01757-3604 SUBJECT: Z--TASK ORDER CONTRACT (TOC) SOL DAHA19-03-R-0002 POC CW3 Thomas Lamont (508) 233-6669 DESC: Best Value Construction Services Task Order Contract (TOC). The USPFO for Massachusetts is soliciting competitive proposals for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for maintenance, repair and construction service for Massachusetts (statewide ). Work to be performed, but not limited to, the following National Guard locations: Barnes Air National Guard Base, Westfield, MA and Otis ANGB, Falmouth, MA, Camp Edwards, MA, Rehoboth Armory, MA, and National Guard Headquarters, Milford, MA. This solici tation is being advertised on an UNRESTRICTED basis inviting full and open competition.  However, as a result of this solicitation, the government’s intent is to have a minimum of seven (7) IDIQ MATOC contracts awarded of which at least three (3) will be 8 (a) and/or HUB Zone qualified contractors (providing sufficient qualified contractors present offers); two (2) awards are set-aside for emerging small businesses (ESB) (providing sufficient qualified contractors present offers); and all other awards are un restricted.  No telephone requests will be accepted. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered. Individual task orders will be issued to TOC contractors based on the low competitive price or a combination of price and other f actors (best value judgments) in accordance with FAR 16.505. However, if a contractor fails to submit a proposal on a reasonable number of proposed Task Order “Request For Proposals”, the contractor waives it’s right to the minimum Task Order guaranty. The  applicable NAICS Codes are 236 and 237 and the corresponding size standard is $28.5M average annual receipts over the last 3 fiscal years.  The scope of work will include, but not be limited to, new construction, repair, alteration, and demolition of exis ting facilities, for DoD facilities within the State of Massachusetts.  Facilities are defined as 1) nonresidential building construction for industrial buildings and warehouses; and 2) nonresidential buildings, other than industrial buildings and warehous es.  The areas of consideration will include, but not be limited to National Guard facilities located within the State of Massachusetts.  A pre-proposal conference is tentatively scheduled at Massachusetts National Guard Headquarters, 50 Maple Street, Milf ord, Massachusetts 01757 at 10AM local time 28 MAY 2003. Contractors should be prepared to submit any questions in writing at the time of the conference. Attendees at the pre-proposal conference are cautioned that the Government will not wait for anyone wh o is late or lost and will not hold another pre-proposal conference. The contract term is anticipated to be for one (1) base year and four (4) option years and will contain a maximum not-to-exceed amount of $20,000,000 over the life of the contract.  The t ask order minimum and maximum is $2,000 to $2,000,000, respectively. Task orders will be issued for the work intended which will require multi-disciplined construction services in all aspects of general construction services and may involve lead and asbest os abatement. In accordance with FAR 16.505(b), the successful Offerors will compete for all task order awards, except that projects valued at less than the ESB reserve amount, currently $25,000, are reserved for qualifying ESB contractors awarded a MATOC.   Attendance at the site visits and the pre-proposal conferences for task order award may be mandatory and the Government will not reimburse contractors for the associated costs.  Due to the nature and the need for expeditious response of the majority of t he construction services required, the selected Contractors will be required to maintain an office in the State of Massachusetts.  The Government will not dir ectly reimburse the Contractors for costs associated with staffing and maintaining this office.  Source selection procedures contained in FAR Part 15.3 shall be utilized to select the successful offers.  Each offeror’s proposal will be thoroughly evaluated  and awards will be made to offeror’s whose proposals are judged to be most advantageous to the Government based upon the evaluation criteria set forth below.  Pricing of the prototypical MATOC project(s) is/are required for the price evaluation.  Proposal s will be evaluated on the following factors in descending order of importance: TECHNICAL FACTORS: Past Performance and Project Management Ability (1) Past Performance; (2) Specialized Experience; (3) Specific Personnel; (4) Quality Control Plans; (5) Orga nization; (6) Scheduling Methodology; (7) Compliance with Small Business Concerns Requirements.  PRICE: Price evaluation of Prototypical Project(s).  Evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  The Government intends to award contracts without conducting discussions, therefore, the Offeror’s initial proposal shall contain its best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  The Government also reserves the right to conduct discu ssions if deemed necessary to obtain the best value.  IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS OR NOTICES TO THIS SOLICITATION.  NOTE:  All questions are to be submitted in writing to Thomas.Lamont@ma.ngb.arm y.mil, or via facsimile transmission to (508) 233-6691.  Questions submitted less than 5 days prior to the closing date may not be addressed before solicitation closing date, therefore, offerors are advised to submit questions as soon as possible.  The Gov ernment intends to award multiple awards and reserves the right to cancel the procurement if it’s in the government’s best interest.  It is preferred that questions be emailed (please clearly indicate your company’s name, paragraph number of the specificat ion and the drawing number, as applicable) versus faxed.  Responses to questions are not considered changes to the RFP, as the only way the RFP can be modified is through an amendment that will be issued on the web site.  Notice to the RFP.  YOU MUST BE RE GISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTER (CCR) PRIOR TO AWARD OF A DOD CONTRACT.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE THE CCR WEB SITE at http://www.ccr.gov.
