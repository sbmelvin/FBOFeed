<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is interested in evaluating the design, production, marketing and sale of a number of technology products to determine whether the most commonly stated obstacles to technology accessibility (such as cost, difficulty and/or timing of built-in accessibility features) are supported by research. This study should look at a range of technology products and with respect to each product, examine cost effectiveness; consumer input at the design stage; the development process; customer use and perceptions; idiosyncratic and standardized industry protocols; and current business and industry practices related to universal design, as well as barriers to implementation. This study should examine the philosophical, economic, industry, and technological rationales that currently drive the development of universal design and document examples of successful and nonsuccessful practices. The evaluation will rely primarily on qualitative research strategies, although some quantitative research approaches may be relied upon for economic analysis involving cost data. The estimated contract period is 10 months. NCD will distribute its Universal Design Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on December 18, 2002. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by February 1, 2003. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date of December 18, 2002.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability is seeking an independent contractor to conduct a research study that examines critical issues surrounding the configuration, financing and delivery of long-term services and supports financing and systems reform. Current financing mechanisms will become unsustainable in the near future and without significant reform, tens of millions of Americans will be unable to find the wide array of affordable and high-quality long-term services and supports options we all expect and deserve.

NCD intends for this research to focus on the following areas: (1) current level(s) and type(s) of involvement by the Federal Government in a range of long-term services and supports systems and financing; (2) current and projected future needs for long-term services and supports in the nation among people with disabilities and people who are elderly; (3) gaps in long-term services and supports; (4) key features of (future) long-term care financing and systems reforms; (5) locales that have incorporated indicators of cohesive and comprehensive reform into their policy and service systems; (6) major challenges and barriers that locales face in moving toward cohesive and comprehensive long-term services and supports financing and systems reform; and (7) promising policy levers and policy changes.

Through this RFP, NCD will focus its attention and resources on an impending crisis in American domestic policy. 

The study plan should project a eleven (11) month implementation work schedule. The approximate release date and closing date are November 15, 2003, and January 5, 2004. The estimated contract period of performance is eleven months. Requests for copies of the RFP may be made by mail or picked up on or after the issue date at the above address. All requests should reference the number and title of the RFP. All inquiries regarding this RFP should be directed to Martin Gould, Ed.D., 202-272-2112 (voice), 202-272-2074 (TTY), mgould@ncd.gov or addressed to Long-Term Services, National Council on Disability, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004.

(15) Supervise the starting of machinery, including such field tests as may be required to determine the proper operation of the engine subsequent to the installation of the proto-type parts.  The only known source to the Government for the parts and services listed above is Fairbanks Morse Engine, Beloit, WI.  This installation is a prototype modification that will address documented concerns associated with light load operation, while maintaining optimum high icebreaking steady state and transient performance.  The light load concerns include excessive oil injection into the exhaust manifolds and piping.  Excessive exhaust oil injection also leads to the cutter’s topside surfaces getting coated with a slippery film of oil.  The oil injection is also an environmental concern, whether carried directly into the sea, or into the bilge.  The second primary low load concern is high smoke opacity.  The prototype installation goals are intended to demonstrate a Fairbanks Morse Engines proprietary modification approach that will successfully address the low load concerns, while maintaining optimum icebreaking steady state and transient load performance.  The engine is a unique opposed piston design.  One of the environmental concerns associated with the 140’ WTGB MSA main engine design decision is whether a modified Fairbanks Morse 8-38D8-1/8 engine will have to meet Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 exhaust emission requirements.  There may be vendors that can repair and tune the FBM diesel, but as a result of these unique design characteristics, it is believed that only the OEM, Fairbanks Morse Engine Division, possesses the design criteria, historical expertise, and technical ability to develop a new load-carrying profile for this engine.  The desired outcome of the engine modification should allow the vessel to operate safely and environmentally compliant at lower vessel speeds associated with new DHS Law Enforcement duties.  All reference documents are available for viewing at 300 East Main Street, Suite 600, Norfolk, VA  23510-9102.  Drawings are now available on CD-ROM. The CD-ROM sets are available for all cutters and will be provided free of charge to contractors upon request. The CD-ROM(s) contain WINDOWS compliant raster/vector formats (e.g.*.TIF, *.TIF (group4), *.DWG, and *.DWF, etc.).  Drawings are still available in hardcopy; however, a non-refundable charge of $150.00 is required in the form of a certified check or money order made payable to the U. S. Coast Guard, MLCA, for each set of requested drawings.  Requests for U.S. Coast Guard specification referenced drawings (CD or hardcopy) must be made within three (3) days from the solicitation issuance date.

<DESC>The project is a continuation of Phase I of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.

Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement for modeling and simulation (M&S) services encompassing an array of technical and analytical support for its Integrated Deepwater System (IDS) program.  Over the past five years myriad technical, analytical, and integration tasks have been performed through an existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with MicroSystems Integration, Inc (MSI).  These tasks included M&S, decision support, cost analysis, operations research/operations analysis, requirements management, and technical consulting.  Services over the next 5 years will continue these technical and analytical M&S support services.  The objectives of the proposed effort are to continue development, use and maintenance of the IDS M&S framework, the M&S environment, the M&S system, resultant M&S models and associated analysis and reports related to the framework, environment, system or resultant simulation models runs.  Key to this effort is conducting campaign-level multi-mission M&S to evaluate performance of the IDS.  The M&S involves a full-range of USCG missions and multiple types of threats in various regional scenarios.  The contractor will update and maintain the Coast Guards Deepwater Maritime Operation Effectiveness Simulation (DMOES), the Maritime Operation Simulation (MarOpsSim), the Deepwater Operation Effectiveness Modeling Environment (DOEME), the system architecture and associated documentation.  USCG intends to issue a sole source contract to MSI for these services as a follow-on effort.  This is not a request for proposals.  No solicitation is available, nor will one be issued.  Parties that believe they can fulfill this requirement should submit qualifications packages prior to the closing date.  Packages must contain a full description of the partys capability to fulfill USCG requirements in sufficient detail to determine whether the firm is acceptable.  Marketing information and high level corporate capability statements are not desired and will not be accepted.  In the event no additional capable firms are identified through this synopsis, the Coast Guard will award a sole source contract. See numbered note 22.  Closing date for submission is 04/20/04.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent River, MD proposes to procure six (6) H-53D troop seats, perform minor medications to such seats and to provide engineering and technical support to the Government’s testing of and analysis of the suitability of the modified seats for incorporation into the V-22 configuration baseline. A firm-fixed price contract is being contemplated.  This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis with Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) under the statutory authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements) as this seat embodies a proprietary design exclusive to IAI.  Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) is the sole designer, developer and producer of the existing V-22 troop seat.  IAI is also the sole designer, developer and producer of the H-53D seat which is a follow-on derivative of the V-22 troop seat design that corrected some, but not all, issues documented during V-22 troop seat testing.  As the H-53D troop seat has already been developed and flight test qualified, incorporation into the V-22 baseline will not require extensive analysis and retest of the dynamic and static airframe analysis.  In addition, as a derivative design of the V-22 troop seat, the H-53D troop seat hinge/mounting interfaces are compatible with the existing V-22 airframe structure thereby eliminating the need for cost prohibitive airframe structural modifications.   IAI will make minor modifications to the H-53D troop seat to address V-22 specific deficiencies.  The approximate issue date is 7 April 2004.  This is for information only.  No phone inquires will be entertained; written or facsimile responses only.  See Numbered Note(s): 22 and 26.

NASA/GSFC plans to extend contract NAS5-32605 for a six month period (June 16, 2004 through December 15, 2004).  These services are a continuation of support for the EOSDIS IV&V.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) as amended in 1996 mandates that EPA address waterborne microbial pathogens, disinfection by-products (DBPs), arsenic, sulfates, radon and other known or anticipated water contaminants, in the context of developing safe drinking water standards.  In this regard,  the Office of Research and Development's objective is to improve the underlying science that supports drinking water standards.  There are three major areas of research in analytical chemistry which support the SDWA: 1)  Microbial Pathogens and Disinfection By-Products  (M/DBP),  2) Arsenic and 3) Emerging microbial pathogens and other contaminants on the Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List (CCL). To address arsenic related issues EPA developed a comprehensive arsenic research program to support drinking water rulemaking activities.  In 1998 ORD released  the arsenic research plan which outlined critical areas of uncertainties surrounding the arsenic risk assessment. The current research emphases is designed  to fill-in the gaps in the 1998 Arsenic Research Plan.  These gaps include arsenic modes of action, exposure research, improved risk  assessment tools and arsenic risk assessments, and risk management, especially cost effective arsenic treatment technologies with an emphasis on small (serving populations of less than 10,000) systems.  The research in the Chemical Exposure Research Branch has focused on the exposure related  issues. The Chemical Exposure Research Branch within the National Exposure Research Laboratory writes research manuscripts for publication in peer reviewed scientific journals, analytical methods for use in compliance monitoring and numerous other technical documents to be shared with the  scientific community.  The Chemical Exposure Research Branch is interested in a technical writer to assist in the production of technical documents. In each of the above cases a rough draft is produced by the principle investigator and this draft needs to be edited in order to improve the  scientific clarity, conciseness and grammatical correctness.  The technical writer will work with the principle investigator to ensure the technical accuracy but the technical writer will be responsible for producing a final in-house copy for review by the co-authors and other appropriate  individuals.  The technical writer will discuss the resulting comments with the principle investigator and incorporate the necessary changes.  The technical writer will be responsible for producing the final document   In the case of journal publications the technical writer will be responsible for  interfacing with the journal to assure format consistency and will aid in incorporating the reviewers comments and drafting the disposition of comments. This work is projected to begin in April 2004.  It is anticipated that the student will work 15 hours per week with the majority of work being  Monday through Thursday of each week between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.  The initial contract will be one year with an option for 12 additional months.  The duty location is Chemical Exposure Research Division, NERL, 26 W. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268.  Work will be  performed under an office setting.  The work is not strenuous and will not require health and safety training.  One award is projected to be made from this announcement. The hourly rate for this position is $16.97 (if the student has a BS/BA + 1 year graduate school), $13.70 (if the student has a  BS/BA degree), or $12.25 (if the student has more than 2 years of college).  Student contractors will be paid the basic hourly rate only for the number of hours worked and do not receive overtime premium.  Student contractors do not accrue leave or holiday benefits and are not paid for any non-work  days, regardless of the reason.  Federal, State, Local, and Social Security taxes will not be withheld; student contractors are responsible for reporting income to authorities and paying all taxes.

<SUBJECT>B -- 1 for 2 Benefit Offset Demonstration Project
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-04-1041
<CONTACT>Christine Nagengast, Contract Specialist, Phone 410965-9515, Fax 410966-9310, Email christine.nagengast@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to procure the services of a contractor to design, implement, evaluate and manage a multi-site demonstration project testing alternate methods of treating work activity in the Title II disability program.  Section 301 of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 amended the Social Security Act by adding Section 234.  Section 234 directs the Commissioner of SSA to carry out experiments and demonstration projects to determine the relative advantages and disadvantages of 1) various alternative methods of treating work activity of individuals receiving Title II benefits based on disability, including such methods as a reduction in benefits based on earnings, designed to encourage these beneficiaries to return to work; 2) altering other limitations and conditions, such as lengthening the trial work period, or altering the 24-month waiting period for Medicare; and 3) implementing a sliding scale benefit offset.  In this demonstration project, SSA is planning for the contractor to test a range of employment support interventions in combination with a $1 reduction in benefits for every $2 in earnings, with the goal of enabling more beneficiaries to return to work and maximize their employment, earnings, and independence.  The employment support interventions would be consistent with, but not limited to, the treatments cited in Section 234.  The benefit offset would eliminate the “cash cliff,” a critical financial barrier often cited as one of the primary reasons for the high rate of unemployment and underemployment among disability beneficiaries.  Unlike current Title II policy, the benefit offset would allow beneficiaries to face a more gradual reduction in their benefits should they earn above a specified amount of monthly income.  Beneficiaries would also maintain ongoing eligibility for health care benefits and other supports linked to Title II eligibility.  SSA has determined that one contractor will be responsible for the design, implementation, evaluation and management of the program.  SSA anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement contract for the contract design with a period of performance not to exceed two years.  After the design is completed, the agency anticipates awarding the subsequent phases of the demonstration (for the implementation, data collection and evaluation and management of the project) to the same contractor on a sole source basis.  The total period of performance for the entire demonstration is dependent upon the result of each phase but anticipated to take no less than five years.  The NAICS code is 541690, with a size standard of $6.0 million.  SSA will issue the solicitation as full and open competition and anticipates release of solicitation number SSA-RFP-04-1041 on or about April 7, 2004 with proposals due 45 calendar days thereafter.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  SSA will not mail hard copies of the solicitation document, honor telephone requests, or maintain a bidders list.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments issued.  Potential offerors shall submit all questions by e-mail to Christine.Nagengast@SSA.gov

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The National Council on Disability (NCD) is interested in evaluating the design, production, marketing and sale of a number of technology products to determine whether the most commonly stated obstacles to technology accessibility (such as cost, difficulty and/or timing of built-in accessibility features) are supported by research. This study should look at a range of technology products and with respect to each product, examine cost effectiveness; consumer input at the design stage; the development process; customer use and perceptions; idiosyncratic and standardized industry protocols; and current business and industry practices related to universal design, as well as barriers to implementation. This study should examine the philosophical, economic, industry, and technological rationales that currently drive the development of universal design and document examples of successful and nonsuccessful practices. The evaluation will rely primarily on qualitative research strategies, although some quantitative research approaches may be relied upon for economic analysis involving cost data. The estimated contract period is 10 months. NCD will distribute its Universal Design Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on December 18, 2002. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by February 7, 2003. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date of December 18, 2002. All requests must reference the RFP number and title. For more information, contact Joan Durocher, jdurocher@ncd.gov,1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004; 202-272-2004 or 202-272-2074 TTY.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for supplemental fishery observer services.  The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples.  Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation.  This data, which cannot be obtained either dockside or while aboard Government research vessels, is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from New York to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in cramped quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities.  Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals.  Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The Government anticipates award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type of contract with a period of performance of one year.  The anticipated issue date for the solicitation is March 15, 2004 with a closing date on or about April 2, 2004. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency. Neither telephone requests nor inquiries will be accepted in response to this notice.  All written inquiries must be received not later than ten days prior to closing date of solicitation.  Requests for copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Numbered note 1 applies.  THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE AMENDMENT NO. 0001 WHICH CHANGES THE LINE ITEMS AND PROVIDES RESPONSES TO VENDORS QUESTIONS.

<DESC>This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the replacement of the Chiller cooling system at the Elizabeth Kee Federal Office Building, 601 Federal Street, Bluefield, West Virginia.  The building will be occupied throughout the entire renovation. 
     	
The successful firm must have previous experience with projects of similar size and scope.  The Government has defined similar projects as: Replacement of chiller systems in an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse or Institutional) of at least 90 tons or greater including associated pumps and BAS control systems.

The contractor's personnel shall be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The estimated cost of this project is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.  The approximate duration of the contract is 6 months, and is expected to begin approximately October, 2004.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract, and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 15.3, shall be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

The acquisition shall consist of four phases:  Phase 1 - Receipt and evaluation of technical and price proposals utilizing the technical evaluation criteria; Phase 2 – Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms; Phase 3 – GSA advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether it is likely or not to be a viable competitor in the next phase.  GSA shall inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their technical submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 – A competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 – Completion of negotiations, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluatation of final offers.  A formal selection of a firm that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of firms to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude them from further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  

The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are: Factor 1: Past Performance on similar contracts and Factor 2: Management and Personnel Qualifications have equal importance while Factor 3: Technical and Organizational Approach has less importance.  The RFP will contain more detail.

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) anticipates revising the SOF Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) synopsis/solicitation H92222-04-R-0001 to include the Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM) system.  The EGLM will become part of the SCAR weapon system.  The EGLM was originally synopsized by USSOCOM on January 6, 2004 under RFP number H92222-04-R-0013.   The EGLM shall be a single shot, 40mm grenade launcher module that will interface with the SCAR Light (5.56mm) and the SCAR Heavy (7.62mm) assault rifles and shall also possess a stand-alone capability.  The EGLM weapon system consists of a 40mm weapon/grenade launcher, fire control and a stand-alone butt-stock assembly.  The EGLM system shall have a fire control system providing day and night targeting and range finding capabilities.  The EGLM design shall not limit the overall length of the round.  The EGLM shall be interoperable with the current family of U.S. munitions, and SCAR L/H.  The EGLM should be compatible with USSOCOM SOPMOD equipment.  The EGLM shall not pose a safety hazard to the operator or nearby personnel, during handling, transport, storage or use.   The EGLM shall incorporate a manual safety device with an integrated safe/fire switch with positive stops.  The EGLM system shall provide a method of target ranging that allows operators to determine range to 600 meters, with error not to exceed ±1m, during day, night, and limited visibility.  The EGLM system, for area targets, shall achieve 8 out of 10 hits at unknown distances to 200 meters on a designated target and 6 out of 10 hits at unknown distances from 201 meters to 300 meters on a designated target.  For point targets, the EGLM shall achieve 8 out of 10 hits on a 36-inch by 36-inch upright target at 100 meters.  The EGLM system shall allow the operator the capability of installing/removing the EGLM system to/from the host SCAR weapon or to/from the butt-stock assembly without the use of Special Tools.  The government will not require the SCAR product samples to include the EGLM; however, the proposal instructions will require the offeror, in the Technical Area proposal, to address the EGLM in a similar fashion as is currently required of the proposed SCAR H.    The eight-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will contain a line item for the EGLM with a minimum quantity of 12/ea complete EGLM systems consisting of weapon, fire control and stand-alone butt-stock assembly.  The minimum quantity of 12/ ea will be identified as Engineering Test Units (ETUs) and will be required 180 days after effective date of delivery order (projected delivery date is July 2005).  The IDIQ contract maximum cumulative quantity is 21,000/ea 40mm weapon/ grenade launchers, 25,000/ea fire controls, and 25,000/ea stand-alone butt-stock assemblies.  The government is not obligated to order more than the minimum quantity.  There is a low rate initial production (LRIP) requirement for 250/ea of all three components.  The LRIP units have a required delivery of 240 days after effective date of order.  Any subsequent orders for any EGLM system component will require delivery to commence 90 days after order with a maximum monthly delivery rate of 500/ea.  Delivery terms are FOB Destination (NSWC Crane IN).  Numbered note 26 applies.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.

AUTEC is located on Andros Island, in the Bahamas with a stateside support facility located in West Palm Beach, Florida.  The AUTEC M&O contract entails support for planning/conduct/reporting of range test programs, maintenance and operation of range instrumentation and related test support systems, and performance of all base operations functions and related requirements.  Site visits will be held at the Andros Island and West Palm Beach facilities from 1-5-04 through 1-15-04.

Additional information regarding site visit reservations, restrictions and security clearance requirements may be found at http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/ under the heading: Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) Information.  The resulting contract will be a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) and Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) with Award Term provisions. The contract will have a three year base with four, 3 year award terms.  Award will be based on a best value determination. Evaluation factors will be Management Approach, Technical Approach, Personnel, Past Performance, and Cost. The Service Contract Act applies. This is a follow-on contract to Contract N61339-97-C-0001.  NAICS: 561210.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years (renewable) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Background

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  It is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s program of assistance that is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources; and improved primary healthcare.  USAID/Almaty manages all USAID assistance for the five Central Asian Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.  Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million, and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are emerging from 150 years of Russian domination.  A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions make Central Asia a particularly difficult challenge for USAID.

Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM) is one of four technical offices in the Mission, and the DM Office Director reports directly to the Mission Director.  Democracy and Conflict Mitigation is responsible for achieving results in the following Mission Strategic Objectives in Central Asia: Strengthened Democratic Culture Among Citizens and Target Institutions, and Sources of Conflict Mitigated in Target Communities.  Activities included in the DM portfolio include assistance in the development of civil society, political process, civic education, media, rule of law, human rights, anti-trafficking, conflict mitigation, and local government, with annual total funding of $30-40 million.

B)	Basic Function 

The Democracy Advisor will serve as the senior manager responsible for rule of law and anti-trafficking.  As such, s/he will provide senior level expert leadership and guidance on democracy policies, strategies, programs and activities.  The Democracy Advisor will provide a full range of consultative, advisory, information-gathering, analytical, and evaluative technical services of broad scope and complexity on democracy issues.

<DESC>United States Postal Service 
Supplier Pre-Qualification
Stamp Affixer Machine


1. Purpose

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is pre-qualifying suppliers for development of an   automated affixing stamp machine using Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) sheets of stamps.  The machine should be capable of automatically applying stamp on first day covers (envelopes) as well as being capable of applying cancellation insignia on each envelope.  The main goal of this automation is to improve operating efficiencies, reduce costs, and reduce employee repetitive motion for hand affixing.


2. Background 

First Day Covers (FDC) is an envelope bearing new stamps that are postmarked on the first day of sale.  For each new postal stamp issue, USPS selects one location, usually related to the stamp subject, as the place for the first day dedication ceremony and the first day postmark.  

Cancellation Services is a unit at Stamp Fulfillment Services responsible for the application of the actual postmark bearing the first day of issuance city and date.  These cancellations can either take the form of a standard “killer bar” (containing lines that appear above and below the words “First Day of Issue”), or a pictorial cancellation (containing a picture along with the words “First Day of Issue”).  

Covers may be cancelled in one of two ways:  Rubber or Metal Die.  All requests must bear the minimum First-Class postage. Gummed stamps are stamps that must be moistened in order to affix it to a piece of mail.  Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) – Self-adhesive; requires no moistening to adhere to paper.  

3. Objectives

The USPS is seeking suppliers of stamp affixer machines.  The functional requirements of the machine are as follows:


• Affix single or multiple single stamps from all pane configurations onto stationery/card stock.  All stamp positions may not be required or used from a pane.  Stamps remaining will be salvaged.
• Cancellation process should be capable of being turned on or off as needed.   Cancellations by rubber or metal die must be dry before shingling or stacking the products in two groups of 25 or 50 pieces.

<SUBJECT>A -- Advanced Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) Range and Vibrational Sensing, Imaging Coherent Optical Radar (ICHOR)
<DESC>ADVANCED ELECTRO-OPTICAL/INFRARED (EO/IR) RANGE AND VIBRATIONAL SENSING, IMAGING COHERENT OPTICAL RADAR (ICHOR) The Electro-Optical Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is interested in industry, government and university Modeling, Test and Evaluation (MT&E) capabilities in the areas of advanced electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) range and vibrational sensing. Potential military applications include mine detection, concealed target identification, masked aircraft detection and other relevant applications that can leverage this technology. The information will be used to identify capabilities to be used in the test and evaluation of ICHOR components and systems developed under the ICHOR Program described in DARPA BAA 04-02, 17 November 2003. The proposed capability must be able to support testing of systems and components to include the levels set forward in the go/no go criteria as provided in the referenced BAA. It is expected that components to be tested could include: detector material structures and geometries, laser sources and optics, read out designs and structures. Established software models and algorithms that support development of ICHOR technologies are of interest, including signal processing concepts. Of additional interest are test ranges/ facilities that can support system and subsystem level testing in operational scenarios. Information you supply in response to this RFI should describe your existing capability/qualifications in sufficient detail to determine your organization’s ability in terms of: 1) test ranges (i. e.  ground truth, meteorological data, target availability, etc. ), 2) test facilities (i. e.  test equipment, calibration standards, clean room, space, environmental, etc. ), 3) modeling and simulation (i. e.  hardware, relevant models, etc. ), 4) personnel (resumes), 5) capacity to respond in a timely manner, 6) previous relevant experience, and 7) ability to handle classified material as required. Gathered information will be used to expand the knowledge base of available MT&E facilities suitable for ICHOR purposes. The government will also use the information to build a potential capabilities list to support MT&E efforts in advancing the state of the art in imaging coherent optical radar and related technologies. Interest in an advantageous capability will be followed by subsequent inquiries and/or visits to the contributor. Organizations that have contributed to similar solicitations to other DOD branches or Government agencies should respond here as well to assure exposure of their capability to the ICHOR Program. This announcement is a request for information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued. However, DARPA will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning, to support decisions in the early May 2004 time frame. It is recognized that any cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. The government also invites comments and ideas related to the ICHOR Program and future commercial and military applications. If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the capability being proposed, please include this information in the response. Questions concerning this announcement should be referred to the Technical POC below. Submissions should be provided NLT 2 April 2004. Electronic submissions in Microsoft Office format are required. White papers in contractor format are acceptable. There are no limitations in number of pages; however an executive summary is required. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: This announcement is UNCLASSIFIED. Information received in response to this RFI may be CLASSIFIED up to the SECRET level. Nonproprietary information is desired, however, any information received in response to this RFI which is marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government. Support contractors will provide analysis of this effort as part of the government team; the government encourages non-disclosure agreements. It is not the intent to reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI.

<ARCHDATE>06232004
<CONTACT>1Lt Christopher Marquis, Contracts Manager, 781-271-6272; Mr. Bill Donaldson, Contracting Officer, 781-271-6091
<DESC>The overall objective of the Airborne Lasercom Terminal (ALT) Program is to design, develop, acquire, and deploy airborne optical satellite communications terminals for Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AISR) and Command and Control (C2) aircraft.  The tentative program plan includes three phases in accordance with the National Security Space Acquisition Policy 03-01.  Phase A is a study phase consisting of technology demonstrations as described in this solicitation/synopsis and system-level architecture studies described in a separate announcement.  Phase B will be the design phase and will be competitively awarded.  Phase C will be the production phase. (i) This announcement is a combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for the Phase A technology demonstrations; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Participation in Phase A of the ALT program will not be a prerequisite or a guarantee for participation in subsequent phases.  (ii) This solicitation, FA8709-04-R-0001, is for Phase A of the Airborne Lasercom Terminal (ALT) program, and is issued as a request for proposal for free-space optical aperture technology demonstrations with a Period of Performance of approximately eighteen months.  (iii) This solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18.  (iv) This solicitation is for full and open competition.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 334220, Wireless Communications and Equipment Manufacturing, with a 750 employee, small business size standard.  (v) CLIN 0001.  Demonstrations and Analyses, to be billed by SubCLIN:  SubCLIN 0001AA Demonstration Test Plan 10% of Price; SubCLIN 0001AB Build of Prototype Subsystem 20% of Price; SubCLIN 0001AC Prototype Demonstration - Step 1 20% of Price; SubCLIN 0001AD Prototype Demonstration - Step 2 10% of Price; SubCLIN 0001AE Prototype Demonstration Reports 40% of Price.  CLIN 0002, Data, Not separately priced.  (vi) Airborne platforms may require optical apertures that minimize platform integration and aerodynamic impacts.  Multiple technologies were identified during market surveys including gimbaled turrets, optical phased arrays (OPA), and Risley prisms.  These various technologies each pose unique platform integration and technology maturation challenges.  Therefore, the objectives of the demonstration effort are to: A. Mature optical aperture/beam director technology performance as close to Department of Defense's (DoD) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 as possible within the budget and schedule constraints identified herein. TRL definitions are available in "DoD 5000-2 TRL Definitions.doc".  All unclassified documents referenced herein as xxx.doc are located on the Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB) at URL http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/esc_opps.asp?rfp=R501. B. Identify an optical aperture/beam director concept that shows how multiple apertures can be integrated to provide a near-hemispherical Field of Regard (FOR) for an airborne platform and also minimizes Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) and installation impacts. C. Provide non-proprietary data documenting demonstrated performance as identified below.  Quarterly progress reports shall also be submitted. D. Identify technology/cost tradeoffs for minimizing life cycle costs and include any reliability estimates. E. Perform to SubCLINs as follows:  (1) Submission of an optical aperture/beam director description and Demonstration Test Plan with test objectives and procedures, resources needed (identifying test and prototype equipment, principal investigator and personnel skill mix), and a plan to obtain required resources; (2) Completion of an optical aperture/beam director (assembled and ready for performance testing); (3) Completion of Step 1 (as defined below) in the approved Demonstration Test Plan; (4) Completion of Step 2 (as defined below) in the approved Demonstration Test Plan; and (5) Submission of a technical report documenting: results of the demonstration, estimate of production SWaP, projected production costs, technology/cost tradeoffs for minimizing life cycle costs, and an installation concept. Technical Description:  The goal of this contract is to demonstrate optical aperture/beam director performance in a relevant environment.  The relevant environment is defined by "ALT Demo Phase Relevant Environment.doc".  Two immature aperture/beam director technologies of potential interest for this demonstration are Risley Prisms and Optical Phased Arrays but others may be submitted (such as turrets/gimbals that require technology maturation to TRL 6) and will be evaluated.  The Contractor shall demonstrate the chosen aperture/beam director technology in accordance with a Government approved two-step Demonstration Test Plan. In Step 1, the Contractor shall conduct a series of performance tests on the optical aperture/beam director.  In Step 2, the contractor shall combine two similar apertures to emulate a larger FOR and demonstrate handoff from one aperture to the other.  The Contractor shall fabricate and test an aperture/beam director capable of demonstrating the parameters identified below.  As a goal, the aperture/beam director shall meet the Contractor supplied values listed in "ALT Demo Phase Parameters of Interest.doc".  The Contractor shall provide necessary facilities and equipment to test the aperture/beam director. Government representatives shall be invited to observe all test events. The Government expects aperture sizes for this demonstration to be less than six inches.  In Step 1, the Contractor shall conduct a performance test of a single aperture/beam director across the FOR.  The test will demonstrate continuous open loop pointing by the aperture/beam director at the Contractor-specified accuracy across the entire FOR while maintaining acceptable beam quality (beam profile and Strehl).  The contractor shall measure the aperture/beam director sidelobes or conduct a stray light rejection test across the FOR. The test will also demonstrate continuous tracking (no tracking loop singularities) anywhere within the FOR at the Contractor-specified performance under the Government-specified vibration spectrum identified in "ALT Demo Phase Relevant Environment.doc".  The test will demonstrate the aperture/beam director meets the Contractor-specified insertion loss and antenna gain requirements across the FOR at the data rates required. The test will demonstrate the aperture/beam director meets the Contractor-specified transmit/receive isolation requirements across the FOR while operating at the wavelengths and polarization identified in the Lasercom Interoperability Standard (LIS) as clarified in "Data for Evaluation" available in the Bidder's Library.  For access to the Bidder's Library, which is located in Building 1103 at Hanscom AFB, MA, contact 1Lt Nat Kilian, 781-271-2485 (Nathaniel.kilian@hanscom.af.mil).  The contractor shall measure the aperture/beam director temporal dispersion (either a direct measure of communications link performance or accurate pulse width measurement) as a function of field angle across the FOR.  In Step 2, the contractor shall combine two similar apertures to create a larger FOR.  The contractor shall conduct tests to demonstrate handoff from one aperture to another in the presence of platform motion and vibration, with a goal of minimizing the time of optical beam interruption for both transmit and receive paths during handoff.    Transmit and receive tests shall be conducted while operating at nominal transmit power and maximum receive sensitivity (both specified by the Contractor) for an air-space link.  For evaluation purposes handoff refers to switching to a different aperture on the airborne side of the link while maintaining communications with the same aperture on the satellite side of the link. The contractor shall measure the duration of any interruption to the transmit or receive signal occurring as a result of aperture/beam director handoff to demonstrate the interruption is equal to or less than the Contractor-specified handoff time.  The contractor shall submit a non-proprietary final report that shall include a system description of the aperture/beam director, demonstration test results including test methods and comparison of results with the Contractor defined values provided in the "ALT Demo Phase Parameters of Interest.doc", estimate of production SwaP and airstream protrusion, projected production costs, technology/cost tradeoffs for minimizing lifecycle costs and an installation concept.  Additionally, the Contractor shall describe in the report the methods or processes that identify a clear path toward realizing data recovery techniques that would achieve aperture handoff without loss of data. Proposal Preparation Instructions. The Offeror may propose more than one technology demonstration but the Offeror must submit a separate self-contained proposal for each.  The proposal shall have unclassified and classified sections.    Classified volumes shall include a color-coded security classification cover sheet and conform to the DD Form 254 instructions (ALT DD-254.doc).  Unclassified submittals shall have covers with a different color than the classified covers.  Apply all appropriate markings including those prescribed in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(e), Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data, and 3.104-4, Disclosure, Protection, and Marking of Contractor Bid or Proposal Information and Source Selection Information.  Proposals shall be submitted in four parts: Volume 1-Price.  Provide proposed price for each CLIN and SubCLIN identified in this solicitation as described under part (ii).  Volume 2-Contractor proposed Statement of Work (SOW). Provide a SOW which as a minimum (1) identifies as an individual task the work necessary to accomplish each of the five subCLINs described in this synopsis, (2) describes any other tasks determined important by the Offeror, and (3) if any particular task results in the generation of data which is required as a data deliverable, the appropriate Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) item on HERRB (ALT Demo Phase CDRL.doc) is identified in that task's SOW paragraph.

<DESC>FY2004 Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) Implementation in Oregon:

The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) is a national USDA program administered by the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS).  WHIP provides technical and financial assistance for the restoration and enhancement of wildlife habitats of national and state significance, threatened and endangered species, and habitats of local concern.  Oregonians may use WHIP funds on lands where fish and wildlife habitat has been impacted by agricultural activities, urban development, or areas where invasive species have negatively altered fish and wildlife populations and habitats.    

For FY2004 Oregon WHIP funding will be available to all areas of Oregon. NRCS will use a Request for Proposals (RFP) process and rank and select submitted proposals.   In the Request for Proposal, NRCS seeks proposals consistent with Oregon’s WHIP funding priorities:

•	Enhancement and restoration of native vegetation on coastal estuaries and salt marsh, streams and rivers, riparian and flood plain, wetlands, native and wet prairie, grasslands, oak woodlands and savanna, shrub/steppe, and mixed coniferous – alpine habitats.

•	Enhancement and restoration of habitats for threatened and endangered fish and wildlife species, and state species listed as “species of special concern”, such as salmonids, short nose sucker, Sage grouse marbled murrlet, western pond turtle, spotted owl, , western gray squirrel, silver spot butterfly, and several vegetative species critical in wildlife habitats.

•	Restoration and enhancement of diverse wildlife habitats that serve multiple species and are critical to threatened and endangered species and species of concern.  

WHIP proposals must be submitted to the NRCS Oregon State Office by 4/23/04.

Eligible projects must be voluntary efforts that benefit species or their habitat on lands controlled by private landowners, state and local governmental entities, or Tribes.  Projects in partnership with other persons or entities are encouraged.  Proposals will be competitively ranked and selected based on a point system consistent with FY04 priorities and the Oregon State Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) Plan.  

Each selected proposal will result in WHIP contracts with the respective landowners.  WHIP contracts are generally 5 to 10 year agreements to provide restoration cost share funding at a 75% federal cost share payment.  However, as part of the 2002 Farm Bill, WHIP now includes the option of a 15-year agreement to allow for the long-term protection of habitat to implement beneficial wildlife habitat practices that do not offer economic return, such as for non-game declining species.  These agreements fund up to 100 percent for implementing practices specifically targeted to restore and protect essential plant and animal habitats.  For 15 year agreements enrolled landowners voluntarily limit future use of their land in order to develop upland, wetland, riparian and aquatic habitat areas.     

Essential plant and animal habitat includes critical habitat designated under federal or state law, locations of listed or candidate species that can be improved with specific practices, or particularly rare and unique habitats that could support at-risk species.  

Implementation: Cooperative Agreement

The selected WHIP proposals will be funded through cooperative agreements. A cooperative agreement will be entered into between the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, (NRCS); and the selected partner.  This cooperative agreement assists both NRCS and the partner with the implementation of common objectives and mutual interests in restoring and protecting fish and wildlife habitat within the state of Oregon. In the agreement NRCS and partner agree to combine their resources to ensure that wildlife habitat in the State of Oregon is restored and maintained.

Upon execution of this agreement, NRCS shall obligate WHIP funds for the implementation of wildlife habitat activities.  This cooperative agreement is the authorizing document to obligate NRCS funds for habitat development activities as proposed in the selected WHIP proposals. 

Partner will design of treatment to create the conditions necessary to develop and maintain the habitat functions of the project area.  This assistance will include activities associated with developing the preliminary and final Wildlife Habitat Development Plans (WHDP) addressing the participant's identified wildlife resource needs.  The WHDP will be developed in accordance with WHIP regulations, policies, and NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) standards.  The plan must contain all conservation practices needed to meet FOTG Quality Criteria for conservation management systems and National Planning Procedures Handbook (NPPH ) planning policy specifically as it relates to the participant's wildlife resources.  Practices approved for cost share in FY2004 are identified in Attachment 1. 

NRCS will provide the partner with sufficient information to perform the tasks outlined in this agreement.  Specifically, NRCS will provide technical and other assistance required to develop and implement wildlife habitat development plans under this cooperative agreement.  NRCS will also provide training and information to partners as it deems necessary to ensure program requirements are performed in accordance with current up-to-date information. NRCS will review the development of an O&M agreement in accordance with WHIP regulations and policies for the project prior to performance of work or award of a contract for which NRCS will provide reimbursement under this agreement.

Fund Distribution

The FY04 WHIP financial assistance funds: 
1.	Distribution goal is 35% tribal and 65% non-tribal.
2.	Will be awarded in statewide competition.
3.	Per proposal cap of $100,000. 
 
RFP Ranking and Selection

The prioritization and funding of proposals will be completed in the following manner:

1.	Applicant completes the proposal form posted in FedBizops.
2.	Applicants are encouraged to visit with NRCS at the respective local USDA Service Center to discuss local wildlife habitat concerns and priorities.
3.	NRCS will select the proposals to be funded. 
4.	At least one proposal will be awarded per each NRCS Basin.  
5.	Additional proposals will be selected from the remaining number of proposals and funds.
6.	Each proposal will be ranked according to the Oregon WHIP Ranking Criteria.

<DESC>This synopsis/solicitation is for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement requests a detailed capabilities statement (technical quote) in addition to a price quote and constitutes the only solicitation; a paper solicitation will not be issued. Request for Quotation number SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 shall be referenced on any capabilities statement (technical quote) and price quote.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC-20 for full and open competition (this competition is unrestricted). All future information about this acquisition including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This contract action may result in multiple awards, or one single award.  Contracts shall be Firm Fixed Price commercial item Purchase Orders, and may be awarded as a Base Year plus 4 option years.  The Government's requirement is for the following commercially available services:  C.1  Background  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is creating and staffing a new Office of Risk Assessment.  One responsibility of this office is providing means and mechanisms for early and focused identification of companies engaged in fraudulent, illegal or inappropriate (including misleading, opaque, or incomplete) financial reporting.  A companion interest in this objective will be to use risk assessment services or products to identify anomalies in disclosure or financial reporting by public companies subject to the SEC’s disclosure program.  For this purpose, the SEC is seeking computer-based products, services, or software.  Offerors are requested to provide a detailed Capabilities Statement for a commercial product capable of achieving some or all of these objectives. C.2 Scope Commercial products shall be used to identify companies requiring additional inquiry and investigation.  These products shall assist the SEC in identifying changes in financial position or operational results in financial statement presentations not evident in a routine reading of disclosure that may represent material deficiencies in the documents filed by public companies.  C.2.1  The initial focus of this analysis will initially be Forms 10-K (annual reports), 10-Q (quarterly reports), and possibly Form 20-F (foreign private issuers).  C.2.2  Offerors’ commercial products shall provide features such as historic coverage of data related to accounting and audit reports for publicly traded companies.  The commercial products shall have analytical capabilities that signal risk factors.  These tools may provide pre-selected criteria for risk analysis and/or allow for customized measures.  C.3  Objectives  Offerors shall provide commercial products having a flexible user interface and/or reporting capability.  An important performance objective is a high ratio of positive signals (problem companies or reports) to false signals (indications of problems that turn out to be incorrect).  More details in databases and computational platforms are provided in the next section.  C.3.1  Desired characteristics of commercial risk assessment products include the following kinds of evaluations and/or comparisons:  1)Evaluation of a company’s present and past financial data  2)Evaluation of a company’s financial ratios against parameters that may suggest inappropriate financial reporting exists  3)Evaluation of other performance measures that may suggest misleading, opaque or incomplete financial reporting  4)Comparison of a company with peers in an industry group  5)Comparison of a company’s risk evaluation with audit opinions  6)Comparison of a company’s accounting reports with other publicly available SEC information (e.g. litigation releases, accounting and auditing releases, EDGAR filings)  C.3.2  Offerors should address the extent to which financial statements conform to accounting standards, generally accepted industry practices, and the requirements of the federal securities laws and regulations.  C.4  Background and Current Environment  It is anticipated that specific risk assessment requirements and resulting objectives will evolve over time.  Consequently, the commercial products will also evolve in sophistication and complexity over time, especially at a point where there are data content tags for the reports filed with the Commission.  C.4.1 The commercial products shall initially provide for interoperability with respect to the SEC’s enterprise architecture.  The SEC’s current development environment includes 1) reporting tools such as Business Objects, Actuate, Crystal, and Brio; 2) databases such as Sybase ASE and Sybase IQ; 3) the Microsoft suite of tools (Access, Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Visio); 4) development languages such as C, TCL, Java, J2EE, HTML, UML, XML, XSLT, JSP, Struts, and Servlets (used with TomCat as the JSP server for web development); 5) PureEdge to display internet forms; 6) web services technologies such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI; 7) Project Version Control System (PVCS) Tracker and PVCS Version Manager for configuration management of automated information systems; 8) Test Director for independent testing; 9) the search engine Autonomy; and 10) firewall and intrusion detection software.  The SEC’s current Technical Infrastructure standards include  A.  Application Servers such as Enterprise Systems:  Sun (Enterprise Servers 4000 series, 4500 series, V880 series, 280 series, E450 series)  Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Departmental Systems:  Sun (Ultra Sparc series, V120 series, 280 series) Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u   Workgroup Systems:  Compaq (File Servers - Proliant ML530, Other Compaq Special purpose servers).  (Migration):  Dell PowerEdge 2550/6450 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  Operating Environment: Microsoft NT Server 4.0  (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server (Active Directory)  B.  Web Servers such as  Dell (Various Models), Sun (Enterprise Servers), Dell PowerEdge  Operating Environment:  Windows 2000, Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Software:  Netscape Suitespot 3.x, Apache, Microsoft IIS, Tomcat  C.  File Servers such as  Systems:  Dell 1650/2550/2650/6450/6650 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  (Migration):  Compliant Proliant ML360/560/580  Operating Environment: Microsoft NTS 4.0 Server/2000 (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2003  C.4.2  Vendors shall be required to ensure confidentiality with respect to SEC queries of risk assessment services and the nature of the information derived from such queries and services.  Vendors shall ensure that no details of SEC usage are disclosed to the public, including possibly a prohibition against their disclosing that the SEC is a user of their product, service, or software.  Period of performance shall be for the period of 12 months.  Award is anticipated in May 2004.  The Government intends to issue one or more commercial item purchase orders for the above items to the responsible vendor whose Capabilities Statement /quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors which are in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical acceptability (i.e., reliability and effectiveness of the product being proposed and its compatibility and interoperability with the SEC’s enterprise architecture),  (2) user training, (3) past performance for requirements that are similar to the SEC’s Statement of Objectives (offerors shall provide complete client contact information so that reference checks may be conducted), and (4)price.    If options are awarded, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price of all options to the total price of the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  This evaluation will be based on information provided by the contractor.  The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the Capabilities Statement or quotation, but may do so at its discretion. Only authorized representatives shall submit quotes. Please carefully review the commercial item clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation. Capabilities Statements that do not include prices for all items will not be considered. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212.1, Instructions to Offeror- Commercial Items (OCT 2000); FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is considered to be most advantageous to the Government, considering technical acceptability, user training, past performance, and price.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions, therefore, it is critical that each quote be fully responsive.  However, the SEC also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary, with offerors making the competitive range (i.e., the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for the purposes of efficiency).  Only those offerors determined to be within the competitive range will be invited to present a demonstration of their product to the SEC and will be asked to provide 30 day access to their commercial item product, free of charge, for evaluation purposes.  FAR provision 52-212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - all offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; FAR clause 52-212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (FEB 2002); FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (APR 2003) - in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply; 52.203-6 Alternate I, 52.222-3, 52.222-19,52.222.21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37,52.232-33,52.232-36, 52.239-1, 52.222-41,52.222-43, 52.222-44. 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) also applies.  Clauses incorporated by reference may be accessed in full text at www.arnet.gov. All Capabilities Statements (technical quotes)and price quotes from responsible sources will be considered. Questions may be submitted on or before 2:00 PM EST April 1, 2004.  The price quote shall be submitted as a completely separate document from the Capabilities Statement (technical quote).  Two (2) copies of each Capabilities Statement (technical quote) and two (2) copies of each price quote shall be submitted to Debra E. Chapman, clearly marked RFQ no. SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 either via hand delivery or U.S. Mail to Securities and Exchange Commission, MS-020, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria VA 22312, or to chapmand@sec.gov, or faxed to (703) 914-9226 no later than 12:00 Noon EST, April 5, 2004.

DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration,  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4 digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed.

However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days.

<DESC>QUESTIONS/ANSWERS/CLARIFICATIONS:

Q.  The buyer is requesting a 5-day Windows XP Professional course, and a 2-day Windows 2003 TCP/IP course. Will the buyer allow the 5-Day Windows XP course to be shortened to 3 days, and taught in conjunction with the 2-day Windows 2003 TCP/IP course?    

A.We would like to purchase test preparation courses for the 4 MCSA courses specified. Each training course should be 5 days long.

A:  The prep tests are to prepare students to take the exams following the courses taken.  Course 2276 and 2277 are mandatory classes to take exam 70-291.  Students will need a prep test for that exam.  The prep test can be a combination of course 2276 and 2277.  


The length of courses should be as follows:
Course 2276 (Implementing a MS Windows Server 2003 TCP/IP Hosts):  2 days
Course 2277 Managing and Maintaining a W2K03 Network Infrastructure:  5 days
Course 2272 Implementing and Supporting Microsoft Windows XP Professional:  5 days
Course 2400 Implementing and Managing Microsoft Exchange 2003 Server:  5 days
	 
Q. With regards to the above Q/A, and the solicitation which states and must provide prep tests for courses 2276, 2272 & 2400.
My new questions: Are you expecting the prep tests to be part of the courseware?  Do you expect the price quoted to include the price for the prep tests or quote that separately?  Do you need the prep test for just the 3 classes, or all of the classes?

A:  The prep tests should be included in the course, but does not have to be an “official” part of the courseware.  The quote should include the cost for prep tests but can be listed as a separate line item within the breakdown of the quote.  As stated above, the Prep Tests should include material to prepare students to take the corresponding exam.  Note that the course numbers above are Microsoft specific, not vendor specific.
 
Q.    Will the course attendees be the same for all courses? 

A.    No. We have 36 technicians to train. There will be 3 sections attending each of the 4 MCSA preparation courses.    Each section contains 12 students.

A:  To explain the above answer: The students will remain the same 12 for each of the 4 courses.  

Q. Can you clarify or give more detail on "instructor contact/support to assist and answer questions of students after training is completed" do the questions relate only to the training that was just completed or are the questions regarding the upcoming certification exams. Are there any estimates on the amount of time that might be required of the vendor in this area?
 
A. Normally instructors will provide a phone number/email address so that students can contact them after course completion for additional support.  I would not anticipate that this will take much of the instructor’s time, but may include questions regarding completed courses.

Q. On the retake issue:
 
Having the folks retake a class with us up to one year is perfect, but my question is w/ the exams/test taking. 
 
If a student fails the exam, are you expecting no charge on retaking the EXAM? 

A. No – we are not expecting that the person retake the exam at not cost…only the course.  We also understand that they will be responsible for bringing the course material rec’d during the initial training.
 
With regards to the above Q/A, I am assuming the sequence you expect the 17 days of training to be offered are 2276, 2277, 2272, and 2400?  How do you want to handle the 2 day 2276 class?  Monday, Tuesday with the next 5-day class offered the following Monday-Friday, or on Thursday, Friday with the next 5-day class offered the following Monday-Friday?  Given Memorial day and July 4th, what days will the Coast Guard NOT be available for class?

A:  Correct…the sequence for the classes is 2276, 2277, 2272 and 2400.  We will not schedule classes the week of 28JUN or 05JUL

   Priority native habitat areas must be the predominant habitat type(s) for the unit.  Restoration goals are to protect and/or restore native vegetation. 
•	Riparian areas are typically associated with creeks and rivers.  Historic riparian areas can be considered when answering this criterion if the project is restoring the riparian area.
•	Shrub/steppe habitats are dominated by grasses, forbs and small shrubs (e.g. Idaho rescue, blue bunch wheatgrass, sagebrush, bitterbrush). 
•	Native grassland habitats are dominated by herbaceous vegetation.
•	Mix conifer-alpine habitat is areas dominated by a diverse tree species with a multi age and height class.
 

Species must be listed in the Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) county list of threatened/endangered, candidate and species of concern.  When more than one species occurs in the project area a cumulative total of points (up to 30 total points) for all species will be used. 

An area used by a species must be identified as critical for the protection or enhancement of the species and habitat.  (A bald eagle flying overhead typically would not be considered as using the site unless it was nesting on the site or the site was adjacent to nest sites or actively used wintering areas.)

   Compliance with the Farm Bill: WHIP participants are required to be in compliance with the conservation provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, in order to receive WHIP cost-share payments. Therefore, WHIP participants who do not participate in other USDA programs will be required to complete an AD-1026 and comply with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation / Wetland Conservation provisions. WHIP applicants who need to complete an AD-1026 should contact the respective Farm Service Agency office.
