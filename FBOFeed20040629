<CONTACT>MELISSA W. GILL CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487368     mgill@usgs.gov;
<DESC>This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is only a Request for Information (RFI).  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid; merely a request for information. The U. S. Geological Survey is considering contracting for support services for the bureau's Strategic Facilities Master Plan.   The goal of the plan is to provide a set of prioritized recommendations to USGS to reduce facilities costs without a severe adverse impact on the science mission of the bureau.  The plan must include a model and process as a basis for future Strategic Facilities Master Plans.  Background:  The USGS is currently located in nearly 400 locations.  Although there are solid scientific reasons for locating these facilities close to the natural resources and hazards that USGS scientists study, the continued growth in facilities related costs requires that USGS evaluate its current situation and establish possible methods for reducing costs.  This plan must look at all existing USGS facilities and define opportunities for consolidation and co-location where it makes sense scientifically and where there are clear cost savings.  This plan is not limited to consolidation and co-location opportunities but must also address any potential targets for reducing facilities costs.   The responses to this RFI should include an approach to accomplishing this plan, proposed format/outline of the final product, approximate level of effort (time required), and approximate cost information (order of magnitude). Responses shall include whether the responding firm is on the GSA Federal Schedule or holds any other Federal Contracting vehicles.  The response format should not exceed 20 pages.  Company and product brochures are not an acceptable part of this response.  The response should be prepared using Microsoft Word.  Questions and all responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Melissa W. Gill at mgill@usgs.gov.  Responses are due no later than close of business on July 19, 2004.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Kaiser NW) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to perform analyses of data on subjects who were included in a case-control study of PSA and DRE screening in relation to prostate cancer mortality.  These analyses will include: 1) risk factors for prostate cancer mortality; 2) factors associated with prostate cancer testing by PSA and DRE; and 3) race and prostate cancer treatment.  Kaiser NW is the only known contractor with access to the required data sets consisting of medical records of 608 Caucasian men and 161 African-American men who died of prostate cancer from 1997 – 2001 and a comparison group of 929 controls, matched to cases on age, race, length of health plan membership, and specific health plan.  Since these analyses are a progression from previous work completed, it is critical that the exact set of samples be used and analyzed in the same manner.   This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.       


I. BACKGROUND

Prostate cancer has few known risk factors.   Only age, race, and family history of prostate cancer have been consistently associated with prostate cancer incidence.  Although only a small proportion of prostate cancers are aggressive enough to lead to death, there have been few studies of the relationship between potential risk factors and prostate cancer mortality.  In addition, few studies have had enough African-American subjects to stratify risk factor analyses on race.  

Little is known about the factors that are associated with use of prostate cancer screening tests, particularly for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing.  Questions on PSA testing have only recently been added to national surveys.  Survey data on PSA and digital rectal exam (DRE) testing may also be of limited value since patients may not know whether they have had these tests.

Controversy surrounds the different screening and treatment modalities for prostate cancer.  Prior studies have demonstrated variations in treatment by race, with African-Americans receiving less aggressive treatment than Caucasians, even after taking into account stage, grade and age at diagnosis.  Hypotheses advanced for receipt of less aggressive treatment by African-Americans include more aggressive tumors, poorer health status, inability to afford medical treatment, personal decision to refuse aggressive treatment, and provider racism, among others.  Since African-Americans are at higher risk of prostate cancer than men of other races, this issue deserves further study.

In a recent case-control study of PSA and DRE screening in relation to prostate cancer mortality, information was collected from the medical records of 608 Caucasian men and 161 African-American men who died of prostate cancer from 1997 to 2001 and a comparison group of 929 controls, matched to the cases on age, race, length of health plan membership, and health plan (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, and Henry Ford Health System).  The primary purpose of the case-control study was to examine whether screening with the PSA test or DRE was associated with reduced prostate cancer mortality.  However, data from the study may also be used for additional analyses related to prostate cancer. 

II. PURPOSE

The vendor will perform three analyses of data on subjects who were included in the case-control study of PSA and DRE screening and prostate cancer mortality.  These analyses would be on the following three topics: (1) risk factors for prostate cancer mortality, (2) factors associated with prostate cancer testing by PSA and DRE, and (3) race and prostate cancer treatment.

  



III. SCOPE OF WORK

Using the data collected in the case-control study of PSA and DRE screening referenced in Section I. Background, the vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment required to analyze the data in the three topic areas listed above.   The vendor shall prepare an analysis plan and a report in the form of a manuscript for each topic area listed above.

IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

The vendor shall perform the following tasks:

A.) Perform an analysis of risk factors for prostate cancer mortality.  This analysis will examine the association of several demographic, health and behavioral factors with prostate cancer mortality, using data collected as part of the case-control study of prostate cancer screening and mortality.  The analysis will also investigate differences by race in the relationship between potential risk factors and prostate cancer mortality.  Factors to be examined will include age, race, height and weight, occupation and industry, history of tobacco use, personal and family history of cancer, history of hypertension and use of antihypertensive medications, history of diabetes and use of diabetic medications, history of vasectomy, and history of several urological conditions or procedures, including benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostatitis, and transurethral prostatectomy (TURP).  

B.) Prepare an analysis plan which describes the plan for the analysis of risk factors for prostate cancer mortality (described in Task A) and includes information on the variables to be examined in the analysis, the analysis methods, and draft table shells.

C.) Provide a report in the form of a manuscript which describes the background, methods, results and interpretation of the results of the analysis of risk factors for prostate cancer mortality (described in
Task A).

D.) Perform an analysis of factors associated with prostate cancer testing by PSA and DRE.  This analysis will examine demographic, health, and behavioral factors associated with prostate cancer screening and with prostate cancer testing that is not screening, by race (Caucasian or African-American) and type of test (PSA or DRE).   This analysis will be conducted among control subjects from the case-control study of prostate cancer screening and mortality.   For subjects who were age 65 and over, the study datasets may be linked to Health Status Questionnaires filled out by health plan members when they become eligible for Medicare.

E.) Prepare an analysis plan which describes the plan for the analysis of factors associated with prostate cancer testing by PSA and DRE (described in Task D) and includes information on the variables to be examined in the analysis, the analysis methods, and draft table shells.

F.) Provide a report in the form of a manuscript which describes the background, methods, results and interpretation of the results of the analysis of factors associated with prostate cancer testing by PSA and DRE (described in Task D).

G.) Perform an analysis of race and prostate cancer treatment.  This analysis will examine differences in the treatment of prostate cancer by race in the case subjects (fatal prostate cancer cases) who were included in the case-control study of prostate cancer screening and mortality.  The relationship between treatment type and demographic, health and behavioral factors will be examined in this population.  The analysis will investigate whether these other factors might explain the differences in treatment by race. Demographic and health information that was collected as part of the case-control study will be used in this analysis.  Pharmacy data that were collected will be used to generate a comorbidity index.  

H.) Prepare an analysis plan which describes the plan for the analysis of race and prostate cancer treatment (described in Task G) and includes information on the variables to be examined in the analysis, the analysis methods, and draft table shells.

I.) Provide a report in the form of a manuscript which describes the background, methods, results and interpretation of the results of the analysis of race and prostate cancer treatment (described in Task G).  This report should discuss the limitations of including only fatal prostate cancer cases in the analysis.

V.   MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS

A.   Experience in analysis of case-control study data on prostate cancer screening.

B.   Knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests (PSA and DRE).

C.  Access to medical records from case-control study of PSA and DRE screening in relation to prostate cancer mortality, information, which included the medical records of 608 Caucasian men and 161 African-American men who died of prostate cancer from 1997 to 2001 and a comparison group of 929 controls, matched to the cases on age, race, length of health plan membership, and health plan (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, and Henry Ford Health System).

CDC needs the vendor to perform three analyses of data on subjects who were included in the case-control study of PSA and DRE screening and prostate cancer mortality.  These analyses would be on the following three topics: (1) risk factors for prostate cancer mortality, (2) factors associated with prostate cancer testing by PSA and DRE, and (3) race and prostate cancer treatment.

Thus Icon Northern Rubber Ltd. is the only vendor that can meet this requirement.  NAICS Code 325212 Applies. SBA Size Standard is 500. Employees.  FSC 2040.

The Principal Investigator, Toxicologist, Chemist, Engineer/Exposure Specialist, Veterinarian, Health and Safety Officer and Quality Assurance Unit Officer shall be employees of the contract laboratory (i.e., not consultants or subcontractors) because the daily interaction and constant coordination of efforts needed amongst these discipline areas throughout the in-life portion of the studies makes it critical that they be physically and organizationally together. This is a notice of intent to negotiate and award a sole source procurement action and is not a  request for competitive proposals. Interested parties who want to challenge the sole source may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement in writing or submit written proposals.  Interested parties  may submit a written request for the Statement of Work and NTP Specifications to the Contracting Officer at  whaley@niehs.nih.gov <mailto:whaley@niehs.nih.gov>. Interested parties must provide  complete point of contact information. Proposals received within the time guidelines set forth in the numbered notes  will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation/notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only notice of intent and a written notice of intent will not be issued.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Myriad Genetics Inc. The notice of intent number being issued as NOI4089.  This Notice of intent document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 325414, which has a business size standard of 500.  The NIAID intends to procure Yeast two-hybrid searches to be completed on overlapping fragments (baits) from HCF-1. Baits will be designed to cover specific protein domains or functional regions designated by the investigator.  Full-length proteins will also be analyzed as bait constructs. Each bait will search against up to three different activation domain libraries. The libraries utilized will include a total human brain library, a cell line library made from breast and prostate cancer models, and a relevant neuronal tissue library (exact cDNA source to be determined - the library to be made as part of the research service).  Each bait fragment will be tested against several million unique prey fragments.  A double genetic selection with multiple reporter genes will be used to isolate only those few pairs of protein fragments that can interact, and the identity of the original bait protein and its interacting partner will be confirmed by DNA sequencing.  All interactions should be reproduce interactions in naïve yeast and specificity will be confirmed using 5 different microbial baits.  The project is to be completed within 6 months and the results, positive or negative, shall be delivered to the investigator.  The results are required for continued progress on two laboratory projects:  AI000711-10 LVD, A novel mammalian transcription factor involved in HSV gene expression and AI000712-10 LVD, Regulation of RNAPII directed transcription of herpes simplex virus.

The 1 gallon exposure chambers were dosed with varying levels of nitrogen and phosphorus to evaluate the effect of differing ratios of  nutrients on these algal communities.  The research interest is to determine if differing levels and ratios of nitrogen and phosphorus will structure the receiving water algal community in a predictable manner. The results from this analysis will be used in support of research conducted by the  USEPA to evaluate the of changing nutrient amounts and rations coming off restored and unrestored watersheds as well as developing a decision support system for how restorations aimed at nutrient sequestration on the watershed will affect the resulting water quality and algal community structure of  receiving water bodies The contractor shall perform the following tasks on approximately 450 samples provided by the Government:  1.	Mount and identify the number of algal species present in each sample.  Algae will be identified into groups by genus and species. 2.

Develop a representative reference collection for these samples. 4.	Provide data report that lists all the identified taxa and the corresponding numbers at each site.  This report  will also include information regarding QAQC for the analysis and identification of the algal species for each sample..   5.	Provide data report in both hard copy and electronic version in standard, off the shelf software applications (i.e. Lotus 123, Microsoft Excel, Word Perfect, Microsoft  Word). This acquisition is designated as a small business set aside under NAICS code 541380. The acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)proposes to enter into a sole-source contract with Alienware Corporation, the only known manufacturer of Area 51-M System. The Advanced Geospatial Intelligence Department (AGI) of NGA did extensive research of the options currently on the market that matched the needs of the software and data they plan to use.  The results revealed that the Alienware Area 51-M Mobile Workstation  best meets the technical requirements of the AGI mobile lab.  This workstation, with the Pentium 4 3.2 GHz 800MHz FSB 2.5MB cache processor with Hyper-Threading Technology, can support near desktop performance with a large screen, full-size keyboard, and responsiveness when using multiple applications, including digital media 3D graphics.  Combined with the workstation’s 80GB hard drive and 2GB of RAM, this supports AGI’s computation and analysis of spectral data files that are typically on the order of 1-10GB.  An additional 80GB boot hard drive for each system allows the lab to be used for multiple levels of security without incurring the cost of an entire additional lab.  The workstation’s case features a magnesium alloy chassis and a 16.1” UltraXGA 1600X1200 High-performance LCD display that can display 16.7 million colors.  DVD+RW/CD-RW combo drives on each system and 10 UB floppy drives for the lab will facilitate the use of multiple data exchange media.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Exploration Systems is releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Human & Robotic Technology (H&RT).  The H&RT BAA is now scheduled for release on July 23, 2004, with Notices of Intent (NOI) due August 6, 2004.   The industry day will be held at NASA Headquarters on July 29, 2004, and further details will be provided via separate notice.  Results of the H&RT Intramural Research Call will be provided prior to BAA release.  Submission of an NOI is required for submission of a full proposal.  Feedback on the Notices of Intent will be provided by August 20, 2004 with full proposals requested by September 17, 2004.  In addition, the following is provided in response to industry comments, and will be incorporated in the final BAA.	 The NOI will now be required to include only the range of costs for the proposed project based on the categories and dollar ranges provided on page 71 of the June 18, 2004 Industry Day.   This is in lieu of a preliminary cost estimate.  In addition, clarification on cost sharing is provided.  Cost sharing on contracts is permitted, but not required. The BAA will solicit research and technology development proposals in support of the following H&RT Programs: Advanced Space Technology Program (ASTP)  The ASTP is the portion of the H&RT portfolio that addresses low to mid TRL technologies, with the goal of exploring innovative concepts and advancing a range of high-leverage technologies.  The goal is to validate these new concepts and technologies experimentally or analytically and to transition them for application in the Explorations Systems Enterprise and other NASA Enterprises.	The nominal path for this transition will be through the Technology Maturation Program, which will adopt, mature and demonstrate the most promising candidates for ultimate transition to flight system development projects. Technology Maturation Program (TMP).  The TMP supports mid TRL technology maturation, demonstration and flight experiments, and will pursue new technologies in the area of high energy space systems, advanced space systems and platforms, advanced space operations, and lunar & planetary surface operations.  The program will advance key technologies required to enable the U. S.  Vision for Space Exploration, with a focus on the human and robotic exploration of the Moon, Mars, and other destinations. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 1,000 employees, respectively. NO PROPOSAL IS REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.	The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.    No BAA exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the BAA.  If a BAA is released it will be posted in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The item to be procured is CLIN 0001:  Inlet Valve Body, Nsn:  4820-01-509-5498, P/N:  5-1-1054.  The Inlet Valve Body is a small rubber molded part used on the M40/42 Series Masks.

The Inlet Valve Body is made of Ethylene propylene (EPDM and EP) type rubber and  measures about .202-inch height by 1.5 inch in diameter.  A groove around the periphery of the part and centered within the .202 height provides a mounting surface when installed on the Mask facepiece. Six sprockets equally spaced and connected at the cen ter of the part provide for open space at the center of the part to allow filtered air to enter the facepiece.   Due to is dual functionally on the mask it is critical that the strict requirements of the TDP (dimensions, surface finishes on sealing areas, rubber properties, etc.) be met.

Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  Offerors should provide past performance information in accordance with Attachment 1, and for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of same or similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 5 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (NOTE:  Include E-mail address and phone number for references!).  The technical quote will be significantly more important than past performance and price.  Past performance is more important than price.  Refer to "ATTACHMENT 1, TECH-EVAL AND PPI" for source selection and evaluation criteria!

Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for same or similar products during the past five years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-9 below on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows:  

52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997)

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails.

(The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)

<DESC>Modification #2 to Previous Announcement.  The following questions have been presented for answers.  1.  Q:  What is the Background Investigation cost for employees? A:  The cost for Background Investigation for each employee is $200.00 - $250.00. 2.  Q:  Are all of the current sites (or any part of them) connected on telephone? A:  Current sites are connected through telephone.   3.  Q:  SPECIFICATIONS #4, Item B.  The solicitation refers to “The operating system must be 28.8 or greater.” And will more modern methods of data transmission be considered (i.e. VPN, DSL)? A:  The 28.8 is the modem speed and other current methods of transmission may be utilized. 4.  Q:  SPECIFICATIONS #4, Item M.  Contractor to upload typed reports into VISTA.  Is there presently an interface that will work in place and if so will that interface be provided by the VA or another vendor? A:  Reports will be uploaded into VISTA by contractor, this can be accomplished through interface provided by VA through VISTA access. 5.  Q:  SPECIFICATIONS #4, Item T.  Byte count and deducting for the number of bytes in a “blank report template”.  Inasmuch as you are requesting a price based on an 80-character line count, would this be truly necessary?  Is this a simple matter of knowing how much “storage” or memory you will need or is it reflective upon the count method used for billing?  A:  If templates are used, the actual typing performed will be reimbursed after deducting the number from the template.  Bytes are used for space and not for billing. 6.  Q:  QUALITY CONTROL/ASSURANCE  Item 12.  Define the exact period of time the permanent retention of voice files will be necessary for the VA to perform its internal qualitative reviews, i.e. 30 days?  Longer? A:  Voice files should be retained for sixty (60) days after the report is transcribed. 7.  Q:  Are all the sites within the same telephone technology system or are they in different telephone systems?  (i.e. can they just dial an extension from one site and reach another?)  Do they have a T1 or T3 phone line?  Are they connected with local access numbers?  Or do they have a voice-over IP system so that they are connected via an internet connection?   A:  All sites are not within the same telephone system and do not have extensions which can be dialed.  T1, T3 phone lines are not available.  Any calls would have to be charge calls.  There is no provision for voice-over IP system. 8.  Q:  If 28.8 is the modem speed then we would most certainly need to know what the operating system is, i.e. DOS, Windows, Linux, Citrix? A:  VA work in a Windows based environment. 9.  Q:  Is VA asking for an 80 character per line billing rate?  A:  One byte of memory is used per character.  Billing would be by characters per line (80 characters per line). 10. Q:  Can the service be outsourced off-shore? A:  All verification and transcription MUST be performed in the United States of America.   11. Q:  Is this a bid to just provide medical transcription services or do we also have to provide you with the digital recorders you need, any pc’s or printers you need, or other equipment or is that a different bid. A:  Please read carefully ALL information contained on pages 1-17.  The dictation for VAMHCS will be done into the vendor’s dictation system.  12. Q:  What type of dictation system we have to interact with? A:  At Martinsburg, Dictaphone system is used for radiology reports and Sudbury RTAS system is used for all other dictation.  13. Q:  Page 10, Item T.  What is the purpose of this if it is determined that a unit of measure for billing purposes is a defined character? In a true character count, either black characters or black and white characters, the total number of printable characters, or in the case of B&W characters, the total number of printable characters and spaces in between on a document or report would be divided by the given number (you’ve asked for 80, although the promotable unit of measure which can be validated by the client is 65) and that would be the number of billable lines.  The number of strokes, bytes, pages, minutes of dictation, nor any other possible unit of measure would enter into this definition given in your statement of work. Please clarify, are you requesting a pricing proposal based on characters or are you requesting a pricing proposal based on bytes? A:  Pricing is based on characters per line (80 characters per line).   14. Q:  Item #R, Page 10.  Are you asking the Contractor to bring up a dictation system in-house at the VA within 24-hours if the telephone system is inoperable? Whose telephone system, the VA’s or the Contractor’s?  What kind of dictation system would the VA be requesting be brought on-line within 24 hours?  Is the VA aware in order for the contract to get a DVI, Lanier, Dictaphone, whatever ordered, programmed, tested, the dictators educated, dictate stations and/or telephone programmed, would take months?  This request, even given a much greater length of time will greatly affect your price per line. A:  The VA will use tapes or alternative methods to record dictation and the vendor will transcribe the reports.  15. Q:  Item #S, Page 10.  I’ll have to check with our HIPAA Compliance Officer, but I don’t think we’re allowed to keep client records that long.   I’m not sure we’re supposed to be keeping client records al all once it’s verified they’re in VISTA. A:   HIPAA has nothing to do with holding the dictation for any length of time. 16. Q:  Item #J, Page 12.  I don’t recall having seen a TAT or QA penalty schedule, please explain. A:  The TAT and penalties are included in the contract.  Please read it.   17. Q:  What is exactly meant by a line?  It is referred to as an 80 character line.  Is this anything on a line up to 80 characters, since the pitch is mentioned or is it characters and spaces + a line? A:  It is 80  characters per line including spaces.   18. Q:  In another section of the contract it state that the bytes of a report will be taken and the transcribed portion deducted from the total report is this how a line will also be calculated? A:   No, it will be 80 characters per line.   19. Q:  How much of an increase in work load with one week notice do you anticipate? A:   Please refer to the contract for this information.  20. Q:  We read that it is to be in Word?  Can it also accommodate MS Word 2000? A:   Yes.  21. Q:  Could we replace all the dictation equipment with all state of the art technology? A:   For Martinsburg, the dictation equipment will not be changes.  VAMHCS will dictate into the vendor’s system so this is not applicable. 22. Q:  Will the VA provide a VPN access or only dial-up access.? A:   Either VPN or dial in access will be provided as deemed appropriate by IRM. 23. Q:  Do the dictation servers need to be on site or can they be off site?  If it is on site can we have net work access to maintain it? A:   For Martinsburg, the dictation servers will remain on site.  For the VAMHCS, this will not be applicable. 24. Q:  Are the 50 ports you quote for both dictators and transcriptionists? A:   Yes, for Martinsburg.  N/A for VAMHCS. 25. Q:  It sounds like the VA will be uploading the reports into VISTA, or will someone be available to assist us in writing a program to get them into VISTA via batch mode. A:   The upload will be done by the vendor.  VA will provide technical assistance only on how to do it.  26. Q:  Who will we get the demographic information?  We have programmers on staff that have written several demographic feeds. A:  We would not require this. 27.  Q:  Will VA accept electronic proposals? A:    No .  Please read Page 14. Old notice/solicitation #512(P)-43-04 was unrestricted, and has been cancelled. New notice/solicitation #512(P)-49-04 is set-aside for Small Business, and quotes are due July 12, 2004, 4:00PM local time.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)-
This is not a solicitation for bids/proposals but a Request for Information.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the OC-ALC/PKOE Operational Contracting Division, Tinker AFB OK to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  This effort is to identify potential chemicals that can be used in combination with low-pressure water to remove rubber and deposits from the runways at Tinker AFB OK.  Previous acquisitions have involved the use of high pressure water only which has resulted in damage to the runway surface, therefore, high pressure water by itself is no longer an acceptable means for cleaning the runways.  The new rubber and tar removal process is to be accomplished by applying a chemical to dissolve and suspend the rubber and tar, washing with pressurized water not to exceed 4000 psi and collecting the solution of water, chemical and rubber/tar with a continuous vacuuming system.  The chemical and the rubber/tar will be filtered from the water and disposed of and the water will be recycled in the closed loop process.  Solid materials and slurries shall be collected in approved containers and disposed of at an approved off-base site.  Water shall be discharged into the base industrial waste water system.  The disposal of all materials shall meet the requirements of Federal. State and Local environmental regulations and requirements.  All contaminated water and debris generated by the cleaning process shall be collected from the runway and taxiways as they are generated.  No water or debris shall be allowed to come in contact with adjacent soil, turf, or waterways.  Request interested sources to submit their capability package including a full description of proposed chemical, including all MSDS information as well as any other pertinent product information no later than close of business, local time, 12 Jul 04.  Respondents may be requested to provide a product demonstration at a later date.  Please include company name, address, telephone number, point(s) of contact with an email address, business size, DUNS number, CCR Registration number, Federal CAGE Code and a description of similar contracts.  The description should include agency name, dollar magnitude, performance period and point of contact with current phone numbers.  This RFI is not a commercial solicitation per FAR Part 12.  Address questions via email to the Contracting Officer, Cynthia L. Cooper/(405) 739-4249/FAX (405) 739-7421/email:  cynthia.cooper@tinker.af.mil.  No discussions will be conducted telephonically.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Procurement Service Center (PSC) for the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses to provide various administrative support services for the NIH Peer Review. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports biomedical research through its on site research facilities (intramural) and by funding research at universities and institutes (extramural).  Funding decisions for extramural research are made by the NIH Peer Review system.  For the purposes of this survey, this includes, but not limited to the following 1) Project control duties: Application receipt(e.g., administrative and logistical support, internal receipt and referral, file management, IMPAC II and other data management, processing of assigned applications and proposals, and document processing and preparation),  2) Administrative Support for the Operations of Integrated Review Groups (IRGs) (e.g., administrative support, data management, meeting logistics, and document processing and preparation, file management ), 3) Travel Reimbursement and Evaluation Awards (e.g., administrative support, IMPAC II and other related data management, and review of travel documents and vouchers), 4) Human Resources (e.g., administrative and logistical support, provides various staffing advice to program management), 5) Committee Management (e.g., administrative and logistical support, internal receipt and referral, file management, IMPAC II and other data management), 6) Office Support (e.g. serves as receptionist, administrative and logistical support, file management)  Services are to be provided to the NIH Bethesda campus.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 561110, Administrative Services, with a size standard of an average annual receipts of $6.0M over the last 3 years.  

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  

If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization, i.e., small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), woman-owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) concern, Veteran, and or Service-disabled Veteran; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements to demonstrate that small business prime contractors can maintain labor, technical, and management control of the project, meeting the limitation on subcontracting imposed on small business set-asides. Taking into account the magnitude of the scope of this effort, organizations also should address the capacity of their financial infrastructure to deliver contract performance. Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the agency program office.  The Government will evaluate the capability information using the following criteria: 1) potential technical capability to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice; 2) potential capacity to secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 3) potential capability to implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel; and risk mitigation; and 4) potential to provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract. Interested firms responding to this survey are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the area of consideration noted above.

Periodic removal and replacement of the cables will be required, and a means of performing this task after the tower is erected should be factored into the design. The tower must comply with ANSI/EIA/TIA-222-F-1996 Specification and with all other applicable federal and local requirements .  All tower-related permits will be the responsibility of the contractor.  2.  Site Information.   The tower will be installed on US Government property.  A site survey will be required to measure soil parameters required for the tower foundation and guy wire anchor points.  Site preparation and access road improvements may be required to accommodate heavy equipment.  All site-related permits will be the responsibility of the contractor.  3.  Guy Wires.  There is interest in utilizing non-steel materials f or the tower guy wires.  This is especially important for the top 200' to 300'.  Also of interest is the use of steel guy wires at the ground connection that transition to non-steel at the top. Any technical and cost estimate information available on non-s teel guy wire materials that may meet these requirements is requested.  Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper containing the following information:  1.

<SUBJECT>D -- Angel 4 Software
<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to negotiate a sole source contract with National Direct Marketing Systems, Atlanta, GA, to provide liscened usage for the Angel 4 Software product.    The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii):  "The required software is available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and  unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements."      This requirement is determined to be available from only one source because of the proprietary and unique features; Angel 4 Software is owned by National Direct Marketing Systems and the Coast Guard is currently licensed to use the product.     The requirement includes licensed access and maintenance support including, but is not limited to, providing new releases, updates, documentation and corrections to the Angel 4 Software.     The expected period of performance consists of a base year and four (4) one-year options.     See Numbered Note 25.     This announcement is not a request for quotations; No solicitation is available.    Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, and may submit technical capabilities, pricing and other information that demonstrates their capability to meet the needs of the Coast Guard.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   Send written responses to the point of contact below via email at rkessler@comdt.uscg.mil, referencing HSCG23-04-R-QAC900, not later than 7/14/2004.

<SUBJECT>A -- Instantaneous Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (IBADS)
<DESC>The Homeland Security Research Advanced Projects Agency (HSARPA) seeks to develop, test and transition the next generation of rapid bio-aerosol sensors for use in Detect-to-Protect system architectures.  Detect-to-Protect systems will require rapid, high-confidence detection and confirmation of a bio-aerosol threat in order to enable advanced strategies to protect individuals from exposure and reduce contamination of critical infrastructure. 
In September of 2003, HSARPA initiated two critical bio-sensor development initiatives under the Detection Systems for Biological and Chemical Countermeasures (DSBCC) Program (RA03-01).  The Biological Automated Network System (BAND) and the Rapid Automated Biological Identification System (RABIS) initiated under RA03-01 will provide for a cost effective, robust capability for continuous monitoring for a broad range of potential bio-aerosol threats with very high sensitivity and specificity.  Under the IBADS initiative we will focus on four key sensor system metrics:  Sensitivity, False Positive Rate, Detection Confidence (Pd), and Response Time — with a particular focus on very short Response Times while still maintaining the best possible combination of the other key metrics.  The new sensor systems developed under an IBADS program described in this draft solicitation would complement the BAND and RABIS systems providing the Department of Homeland Security a full range of potential bio-aerosol detection technologies. 
We anticipate initiating the IBADS in early FY05 subject to the availability of future funding for this priority. A future IBADS program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which would follow from this Draft Statement of Work for Comment (DSWC), would solicit research in novel approaches to rapid bio-aerosol sensors.  
The purpose of this early DSWC is to invite the technical community to provide specific comment to HSARPA on the structure and content of a new program initiative in this area and to encourage potential bidders to engage in early technical discussions with HSARPA with regards to potential technical solutions to these challenges.

<SUBJECT>A -- Clinical and Statistical Coordinating Center for Cooperative Clinical Trials
<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to negotiate with The EMMES Corporation for a modification of its contract No. N01-AI-15423, that was awarded as a 100% small business set-aside, under SIC 8731; NAICS 541710; size standard of 500 employees.

This contract supports NIAID's research program to develop and evaluate novel therapeutic regimens for prolonging graft and patient survival, while minimizing unwanted side effects of immunosuppression, in pediatric renal transplantation.  Clinical trials are supported by separate Cooperative Agreement awards and are developed by the Cooperative Clinical Trial in Pediatric Transplantation (CCTPT) Steering Committee in collaboration with NIAID.  The contractor provides statistical, clinical, technical, regulatory, and administrative expertise to NIAID, its investigators, and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB).  The planned negotiated modification will permit increased effort for the remaining period of performance in order to expand the scope of work: (1) provide statistical and clinical trial design expertise for new clinical trials in pediatric and adult renal transplantation, including the development of mechanistic studies on the immunomodulatory approaches conducted by the CCTPT; (2) establish and administer systems for the collection, storage, management, quality assurance, and reporting of study data; (3) conduct clinical trial site monitoring and training for all clinical trial sites; (4) provide support for regulatory functions associated with Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, including the preparation of interim and annual reports required by regulatory agencies; (5) establish and manage a system for the distribution and quality control of study products and supplies, and; (6) provide statistical, administrative, technical, and logistical support for the CCTPT steering committee and the independent DSMB.  This will be for immediate use by CCTPT investigators and DSMB members.  These activities will require expansion of all aspects of the contractor's infrastructure, already in place, to meet the increased needs of the NIAID-supported clinical trials.

Authority:  41 USC 253(c)(1), as set for in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform this expansion, they must respond by submitting three (3) copies of the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort. You are directed to Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26. No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE COMPACT ACCELERATOR
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE COMPACT ACCELERATOR 

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's improved compact accelerator technology.

Existing moderate energy intense beam accelerators have relatively low accelerating gradients. LLNL is developing a new type of compact, intense beam accelerator.  This technology may result in major cost advantages over existing accelerators.  The compact nature of the accelerator architecture and the dramatic reduction in terms of space requirements is expected to make possible applications in the fields of lithography, materials treatment such as ion implantation and welding, cancer therapy, radiation sources for nondestructive testing and others.  The potential improvements to existing accelerator technology include high accelerating gradient and intense beam capability.


Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's improved compact accelerator technology should provide a written statement of interest that includes:

1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	Description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 68-04.

The services shall be issued via delivery orders and are in support of Shipyard availabilities.    It is essential that the proper skill level of Marine Diesel Mechanics be supplied for each individual order placed under the resulting contract.

The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Marine Diesel Mechanics/Lead Marine Diesel Mechanics in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications – Marine Diesel Mechanics/Lead Marine Diesel Mechanic must have the skill and a thorough knowledge in installing, removing, operating and repairing a variety of conventional and modified marine diesel engines and accessory systems in order to troubleshoot, maintain, repair and/or test different types of diesel engines for marine type vessels.

Mechanics and Lead Mechanic must also have and apply skills using test equipment to locate and determine the cause of the defect, such as possible material failure and determine the repair needed, selecting appropriate troubleshooting techniques to identify engine malfunctions.  Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications of the Marine Diesel Mechanics/Lead Marine Diesel Mechanics that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.  A PROPOSAL THAT MERELY STATES THAT THE WORKERS WILL MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SOLICITATION MAY BE DETERMINED TECHNICALLY UNACCEPTABLE.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Marine Diesel Mechanics/Lead Marine Diesel Mechanic.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum one (1) and up to five (5) qualified Marine Diesel Mechanics with one (1) Lead Marine Diesel Mechanic within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.    Price Proposal: Offeror shall provide an hourly rate and overtime rate for the following labor categories:  CLIN 0001 – MARINE DIESEL MECHANIC and CLIN 0002 - LEAD MARINE DIESEL MECHANIC.    These rates shall include all costs to perform the required services.  The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 1,380 hours, inclusive of overtime, (1,200 hrs/Marine Diesel Mechanics, 180 hours Lead Marine Diesel Mechanics) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.  Estimated overtime for Marine Diesel Mechanics is 200 hours and 30 hours for the Lead Mechanic.  These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Marine Diesel Mechanics/Lead Marine Diesel Mechanics shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.

In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Marine Diesel Mechanics are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 200 for Marine Diesel Mechanics and 30 for the Lead Marine Diesel Mechanic.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Programs for Certain Commercial Items (10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) and 253a and 253b). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ)-10-04-032-REL. This solicitation is restricted to 100% Small Business concerns. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 541219 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million. PRICE SCHEDULE: Offers should be submitted for BASE YEAR: 160 hours @ $________ per hour = $__________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 480 hours @ $________ per hour = $__________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 480 hours @ $________ per hour = $__________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 480 hours @ $________ per hour = $__________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 480 hours @ $________ per hour = $__________. INTRODUCTION: A new Federal program was created in 1996 to bring into parity the costs of urban and rural data communications circuits. This program was designed to reimburse rural health care facilities for the monthly costs incurred in providing data communications from the rural site to another connecting site. The formula for reimbursement was the closest urban city costs subtracted from the rural community costs which amounted to reimbursement to the rural facility. This new program was to be managed by the Rural Health Care Corporation (RHCC), a quasi-Federal agency that required a system of documents to be submitted in a chronological order. The information contained in these forms was of both a technical and demographical nature, requiring interaction between the communications carrier and the health care provider. Soon, the Billings Area Indian Health Service Office of Information Management discovered the need for a telecommunications specialist with prior experience with the system and the contracts within the system. Thus, the Indian Health Service has acquired these services previously through purchase orders. The Rural Health Care Division (RHCD), formerly known as the Rural Health Care Corporation (RHCC) was established to administer the Universal Service program for rural health care providers. RHCD is officially referred to as the Rural Health Care Division of USAC. STATEMENT OF WORK: The contractor will be required to: (1) Aid in preparing the initial 465 Form, Description of Services Request, for submission to the RHCD; (2) Upon acceptance of the RHCD, prepare Form 466, Funding Request and Certification; (3) Maintain an orderly, organized folder of all correspondence from and to the RHCD. This requires monthly on-site interaction with the Indian Health Service Telecommunications Specialist at the Billings Area Office; (4) Verbally, and in writing, communicate with the carriers and the RHCD to ensure a timely and efficient flow of documentation; (5) Maintain a log of monies due and collectable by the Billings Area for reimbursement; and (6) Periodically review network for efficiencies with the T1 and 56K circuits. The contractor will be required to (1) inform the Indian Health Service of potential cost savings or price increases; (2) provide recommendations regarding telecommunications circuits; and (3) complete RHCD forms prior to deadlines. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide the Contractor with all routine office equipment (computer, printer, telephone) needed to perform the services. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The performance of this contract shall be for a 2-month period with the option to renew for 4 successive 12-month periods. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. PROJECT OFFICER: The project officer shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractors technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract. INVOICE SUBMISSION AND PAYMENT: The Contractor shall submit its invoice to the Project Officer. The Contractor agrees to include the following information on each invoice: (1) Contractors name, address; (2) Contract Number; (3) Invoice number and date; (4) Total amount due; (5) Dates of Service including the actual number of hours worked; and (6) Remit to address.

A firing circuit may be tested at any time by pressing the BLACK galvanometer button. A reading of approximately one-half full scale indicates a satisfactory circuit. The large RED safety button, when pressed, connects the firing circuit to the line and releases the dumping resistor. When the RED button is released, the firing circuit is disconnected and a resistor placed across the firing capacitors thereby discharging them. The YELLOW charging/firing switch has a neutral or off position. Pulling the switch backwards will charge the 10,000 microfarad (uFd) capacitors to 36 volts. Normal time for full charge is 15 seconds. Pushing the YELLOW switch forward connects the charged capacitors to the spring loaded output terminals. Remember, the galvanometer button can be pressed even when the firing capacitors are fully charged.,25,EA2,Martin Kaiser: 4020 Mini-Stethoscope - The 4020 is a pocket size (3/4x2x4 inches) high gain, low noise amplifier designed specifically for EOD applications.

Output impedance of 16 to 2000 ohms can match virtually any headset. The 4020 is powered by a single 9 volt battery which, under normal conditions, provides over 200 hours of operating life. Amplifier contains belt clip for easy mounting.,15,EA3,Shipping,1,LT.

<DESC>The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) has a requirement for operation, maintenance and monitoring services at the Summitville Mine Superfund Site located in the San Juan Mountains of southwest Colorado.  This acquisition is using predominately federal funding under a cooperative agreement with USEPA.  Task areas include (1) project planning, management and support, (2) Water Treatment Plant operations and maintenance, (3) on-site laboratory and analytical support, (4) monitoring and data acquisition, (5) general site maintenance and management, and (6) database management and Internet support.  These tasks encompass monitoring of all facilities, structures, existing revegetation, on-site environmental monitoring and off-site in the Alamosa River and Terrace Reservoir (surface water, sediment and aquatic life).  Additional tasks within the general scope of work may be added to the contract if the situation dictates.  CDPHE anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price contract with a one-year base period and five one-year option periods.  The estimated start and completion dates for this procurement are September 2004 to September 2010.  The solicitation for this requirement will also be posted on the State of Colorado Bids Information Distribution System (BIDS) on or around June 9, 2004.

There has been a request to extend the bid deadline from several of the interested parties.  Those parties suggested that more time is needed to fully understand the complex requirements in the RFP.  We have granted that request and are extending the bid deadline one week.  Interested parties who plan to submit a proposal must be registered with the Bids Information Distribution System (BIDS) no later than the date and time of the bid deadline on July 16, 2004 at 3:00 PM MST.  For information on BIDS registration go to http://www.gssa.state.co.us/.  Proposals must be submitted in response to Request for Proposal Number CDPHE-RO-HAZ0501.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

6. PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILES

The Municipality of Rio de Janeiro has a population of 5.85 million inhabitants and encompasses an area of 1,171 square km.  There are approximately 1.5 million automobiles in the city and total vehicle fleet is 1,772,697.  The road network extends 8,500 km; there are two subway lines extending 35 km that carry 417,000 passengers/day; and 5 suburban train lines that extend 242 km and carry 321,000 passengers/day.  The public bus fleet handles 4 million passengers/day with a total 7,535 buses operating on 435 lines.

CET Rio is the municipal agency responsible for traffic management, road network planning and projects, and traffic safety programs.  The objective of the structural ways optimization project is to optimize security, mobility and accessibility of Rio de Janeiro’s structural ways through the intensive employment of intelligent transportation systems (ITS).  CET Rio is seeking to upgrade and integrate their traffic signal control, closed circuit cameras, and passenger information systems into one platform.  CET Rio’s existing traffic signaling system covers one-half of the city’s approximately 2,000 intersections that have traffic signals.  

Rio de Janeiro has been selected as the site for the 2007 Pan American Games, which will place an extraordinary burden on an already outdated system of traffic management.  CET Rio’s goal is to implement the modernization of its traffic management system before the games are held. In fact, the area of the city where most of the activities associated with the Games will be held is the area that is not currently incorporated into CET Rio’s traffic signaling management system. The project will involve moving to an automated and adaptive traffic control system.  At present, there are only a limited number of traffic detectors and CET Rio’s engineers must review the information manually and then program changes to the traffic signal control system.  CET Rio is also interested in expanding its network of closed circuit cameras to more effectively monitor and manage traffic control.  The project will also involve the expansion of its passenger information system to increase the use of variable message systems and to provide real-time information about arrival times to its call center and internet site.

In addition, USTDA has received a second request for funding related to ITS solutions for urban transport in Rio de Janeiro from the municipal Superintendency of  Urban Transport.  The municipal government is preparing to re-compete the concessions to operate bus routes in the city and is proposing to re-organize and rationalize the existing bus system.  The project will involve the rationalization of routes, the creation of dedicated bus corridors, tariff integration, and the integration of multi-modal systems, all of which are expected to have a significant technology component.  The definitional mission will also obtain additional information about this project and evaluate it for possible USTDA funding support.

6		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

This definitional mission will evaluate the terms, feasibility, and impact of five telecommunications projects proposed by the Government of Colombia.  The proposed technical assistance projects would contribute to enhanced competition in the Colombian telecom market and foster the adoption of new telecom technologies.  The project proposals were presented by three potential grantees: the Ministry of Communications (MinComm), the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (CRT), and the Civil Aeronautical Special Administrative Unit (AeroCivil).  The MinComm and CRT jointly proposed four projects: long distance competition, local loop unbundling (LLU), emerging technology development, and text messaging service interconnectivity.  AeroCivil presented a proposal for the aeronautical telecom network development project.

MinComm/CRT Projects:
1)	Long Distance Competition Project:  The objective of the proposed technical assistance is to encourage greater competition in the long distance service market through a reassessment of the license price.  When the long distance market was opened in 1997, the price of a long distance service license was set at $150 million.  MinComm and CRT wish to conduct a study to update the license price given the evolution of new services and technologies, as well as new market conditions since 1997.  The cost of the technical assistance is estimated to be $165,000.

2)	Local Loop Unbundling Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to encourage the adoption of broadband technology through the unbundling of the local loop. Given the inability of the current service providers to develop the broadband market through DSL technology, MinComm and CRT wish to undertake local loop unbundling to permit the adoption of broadband technologies.  The cost of the technical assistance is estimated to be $190,000.

3)	Emerging Technology Development Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to expand internet access to rural areas of Colombia utilizing technologies such as Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi), digital video broadcasting (DVB), and Power Line Communications (PLC).  The targeted end users are health, educational, and local government institutions. The cost of the technical assistance is estimated to $335,000.

4)	Text Messaging Service Interconnectivity Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to expand the text messaging market by developing interconnectivity between the two main messaging formats currently in use in Colombia (cellular and PCS).  Interconnectivity would increase the use of and demand for short message service (SMS) and multimedia message service (MMS), promoting sector development and improved customer service.  The cost of the technical assistance is estimated to be $97,000.

AeroCivil Project:  
5)	Aeronautical Telecom Network Development Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to update the existing voice and data telecom networks in the civil aviation sector and to foster the development of new civil aviation-related telecom services.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.
