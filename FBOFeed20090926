The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Department requires professional services to procure, install, and support an EMC Symmetrix V-MAX Storage Area Network (SAN) installation.  This device will provide primary storage for current and future growth of all HR Integrated Personnel Management System (IPMS) corporate initiatives.  The SAN will also provide the required storage footprint for the upcoming transition of all HR infrastructure equipment from the Washington DC-area to ESOC East.  EMC professional services are integral to ensure the successful deployment of the V-MAX product at the Bureau.  41 USC 253(g) and FAR 13.501, Only One Responsible Source (Brand Name Only).  The EMC V-MAX product is a brand new technology.  This places EMC's professional services in a uniquely qualified position to ensure the deployment of the V-MAX product is accomplished expediently and accurately.  EMC's professional services deployed all previous EMC DMX and EMC Clariion SAN device installations at the HR Bureau.  EMC is in a unique position with their knowledge of the requirements and architecture of the currently deployed SAN infrastructure.  The vendors' institutional knowledge of the HR SAN infrastructure will reduce deployment costs incurred by HR for this deployment because of their knowledge of the SAN environment.  Continued investment in EMC services, training, and systems management minimizes costs for the organization through standardization.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are used as a basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by EMC brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements.  Although the EMC branded product is the only maintenance that meets the Department's needs, the items are available from EMC direct or through any of several EMC-authorized resellers.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), University Drive C, Pittsburgh, PA  15240 intends to negotiate with Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., 5160 Hacienda Drive, Dublin, CA  94568 for a VISUCAM NM/FA with stereo license/19" flat monitor, printer and IT3F table in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1.  One of the most important aspects of this Fundus camera is that it is fully DICom compatible with a built-in integration for CPRS and the VISTA Imaging System within the VA Healthcare System nationwide.  It integrates with all of the other eye equipment used for diagnostic purposes in the eye clinic and operating room.  It is easy to use and provides an integrated system with a small footprint.  It can get through the smallest undilated pupil 3.3mm for color fundus photography required for angiography. It has a medical grade 5 mega pixel sensor which enables the surgeon to see every detail for accurate diagnosis.  The camera uses infra-red light to ensure the patient is in the exact alignment for the camera and it provides internal preprogrammed fixation as well as manual adjustments.  This performs Anterior Segment Imaging, auto montage as well as auto separation into red, green, and blue monochromatic images for pathology. There is also a 19" LCD display for alignment and patient education. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature to the Contracting Officer no later than September 28, 2:00 P.M.  Responses should be sent to Kathleen.Policicchoi@va.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

The Air Force intends to award a sole source contract to Deltek, Inc.  The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine if there are any businesses available who are capable of performing the effort described herein.  The Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is seeking sources to provide:
An earned value management tool suite specifically designed to engage technical, schedule, and financial professionals in proactive management of their projects. The models are applicable to a wide range of systems acquired by the United States Government (such as aircraft, engines, armament, avionics, radar, software, simulators, support equipment, etc.). The models perform earned value management calculations and have the ability to be adjusted to specific organizations and technologies. wInsight provides state-of-the-art techniques to quickly locate problem areas, graphically review performance trends, generate statistical estimates at completions, and obtain feedback from team members.  wInsight scales from entry level schedule-based earned value system through complete enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.  Data can be viewed in dollars, hours or equivalent persons (EQP).  wInsight integrates with a wide range of project management tools including SAP, Microsoft P! roject, Primavera P3/SureTrak, Deltek Open Plan/Cobra, Deltek MPM, and IMC Millennium.  For organizations that currently use a variety of these project management tools, wInsight provides a common data base for analysis and reporting on all projects across the enterprise. wInsight is the premier cost performance management tool for Windows and is currently used by leading programs in the United States Air Force, Army, Navy, Department of Energy (DOE), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and industry to integrate earned value into their management process. wInsight is also being used by the Defense Systems Management College (DSMC) in sophisticated simulations to teach advanced performance management techniques that integrate cost performance data with true schedule status. wInsight is specifically designed to support both Integrated Product Development (IPD) team members and cost/schedule professionals. Its unique user interface ! reduces the time required to conduct cost performance management analysis by as much as twenty times, and integrates true schedule status via C/S Glue, the optional interface to MS Project or Deltek Open Plan. Integrating cost performance data with true schedule status is something no other analysis tool supports, and is an essential component to engage IPD team members in proactive performance management.

The notice shall contain a statement of the amount claimed and the change in fixed hourly rates (if this is a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract), and any relevant supporting data, including payroll records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require. Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price, contract unit price labor rates, or fixed hourly rates shall be modified in writing. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and its effective date. <br />(g) The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of extensions of IBM NAS HW/SW Support Renewal of IBM Servers. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that IBM will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on-site service and parts when necessary. The 41 USC 253(c )(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the servicers identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC)<br /><br /><br />Part I. Background Information</p>
<p>1. Agency: Health Resources and Services Administration</p>
<p>Program Office: Poison Contract Program<br />Division of Healthcare Preparedness <br />Healthcare Systems Bureau</p>
<p>Project Officer: Lori Roche<br />(301)443-0652</p>
<p>2. Descriptive Title of Project: Poison Help Campaign Technical Expertise and Poison Data Support</p>
<p>Proposed Contractor: American Association for Poison Control <br /><br />Requisition Number: 09-N234-6253<br /><br />Period of Performance: 12 month base year with two twelve month <br />Option Years</p>
<p>3. Purpose of the Acquisition and a Brief History</p>
<p>a. Overall program and purpose:</p>
<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Poison Control Program (PCP) was established in February 2000 under the Poison Center Ehancement and Awareness Act. Funds were appropriated in FY 2001 to carry out the purposes of the Act. The program was reauthorized in 2003 under the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act, Amendments of 2003. The program was reauthorized again in 2008 under the Poison Center Support, Enhancement , and<br />Awareness Act of 2008. This Act authorizes funding to establish and maintain a national toll-free number to access Poison Control Center (PCC) services, implement a nationwide poison prevention media campaign to promote the toll-free number, develop education programs and standard patient management protocols for commonly encountered exposures and improve and expand national toxic exposure surveillance data.</p>
<p>The PCP provides grants to poison control centers (PCCs) to prevent and provide treatment recommendations for poisonings and to comply with certification requirements. PCCs provide 24-hour professional treatment advice to physicians, hospitals, public health departments, and the general public regarding poisoning exposures. PCCs also provide professional education and information to the public on poison prevention.</p>
<p>Each year, more than 3,000,000 poison exposures are reported to the nation's 61 PCCs. The PCCs capture this data and automatically upload it into the National Poison Data System (NPDS), owned by the American Association of Poison Centers (AAPCC). These regional centers are members of the AAPCC. The goal of the AAPCC and its member centers is to reduce morbidity and mortality due to poisoning. <br /><br />A sole source, cost-reimbursement contract with the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), a nationwide organization of Poison Control Centers, shall be procured to enhance and expand the National Poison Help Campaign through technical expertise, to conduct a statistical analysis to determine if the current formula used to determine transition rates-i.e., the ratio of 1-800 Poison Help number call volume to the total call volume-is still valid and applicable, and to provide HRSA access to NPDS case and call volume to report on a program GPRA goal.</p>
<p>This contract is valued at approximately $200,000 for one year and two optional years, each at $200,000. Optional tasks are subject to the availability of funding.</p>
<p><br />b. A description of the specific requirement to be accomplished by this contract:</p>
<p>In response to legislative requirements, the HRSA Poison Control Program has a contract in place with a nationally recognized media/marketing firm, to build upon, expand, and maintain the Poison Help campaign. The AAPCC will work with HRSA and the media/marketing contractor, through this contract, to provide technically accurate and scientifically based expertise for the development of campaign messages and materials. To that end, the AAPCC shall also coordinate unified National Poison Prevention Week activities among their PCC members. In addition, the AAPCC will conduct a statistical analysis to determine if the current formula used to determine transition rates-i.e., the ratio of 1-800 Poison Help number call volume to the total call volume-is still valid and applicable. In addition, AAPCC shall provide HRSA access to NPDS case and call volume data so that HRSA can report on it's GRPA goal to increase toll-free call volume.</p>
<p>Through optional tasks, based on performance and availability of funding, the contractor shall develop and provide on-line training on the NPDS to the poison control centers, provide research assistance to HRSA and the poison centers, coordinate National Poison Prevention Week activities among PCCs, update national poison prevention fact sheets and implement a Web cast to educate health and injury prevention organization and agencies about NPDS.</p>
<p>c. Why a contract as the award instrument:</p>
<p>The proposed work is of direct use and benefit to the Government and is in direct support the Division of Healthcare Preparedness, HRSA.</p>
<p>d. Government's Cost: $600,000</p>
<p>This cost is based on an estimate derived the contractor current expenditure rate. This rate was projected for nine months into the future to arrive at the Government estimate. When the contractor is asked for a proposal a detailed cost analysis of will be conducted and the final cost will be negotiated using that analysis to arrive at a fair and reasonable cost.</p>
<p><br />Part II. Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>1. Statutory authority:</p>
<p>The non-competitive acquisition is consistent with 42 U.S.C. 300d-73 as amended by the Poison Center Support and Enhancement and Awareness Act of 2008 and FAR 6.302-5(a)(1)(2)</p>
<p>When the services required by the agency are available from one responsible source full and open competition need not be provided for when (i) a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specific source.</p>
<p>2. Reasons for selecting cited authorities:</p>
<p>This procurement action is requested as a sole-source award to the American Association for Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) because it is the primary member organization of poison control centers (HRSA's Poison Control Program grantees). As the only organization with membership that includes all of the nation's poison control centers, the AAPCC has the unique expertise to inform the ongoing development and implementation of the national Poison Help campaign. In addition, the AAPCC is the only organization that collects and compiles data from the nation's 61 poison centers, analyzes the data, and conducts national toxicosurveillance in coordination with the CDC. As such it is uniquely suited to evaluate the validity of the statistical formula used to calculate the national transition rate-the ratio of 1-800 Poison Help number call volume to the total call volume. Therefore, this contract must be awarded to the American Association for Poison Control Center.</p>
<p>3. Efforts made to solicit other potential sources:</p>
<p>No other sources were solicited because there are no other sources capable of performing the duties outlined in the contract.</p>
<p>4. Anticipated costs to the government:</p>
<p>$600,000</p>
<p>5. Other pertinent facts supporting the use of JOFOC:</p>
<p>The AAPCC is the only organization that collects and compiles data from the nation's 61 poison centers, analyzes the data, and conducts national toxicosurveillance in coordination with the CDC.</p>
<p><br />7. Actions taken or anticipated to avoid in the future, continued use of the JOFOC mechanism:</p>
<p>This is not applicable because no actions can be taken. The authority for determining the agency responsible for activities related to Section 1273 of the Public Health Act (42 U,S,C, 300d - 73) as amended by the Poison Center Support and Enhancement and Awareness Act of 2008.</p>
<p>8. Certification of Justification: This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief, the justification for other than full and open competition described in Part I above meets the minimum needs or scheduled requirements of the agency, and is accurate and complete as required by FAR 6.302-5.</p>

<AWARDEE>JOHNSON, BASSIN AND SHAW, INC., 5515 SECURITY LANE

<DESC>Purpose of Task Order:
a.	The purpose of this task order is to provide support staff to supplement and enhance the Community Service Block Grant, American Recovery and Reinvention Act (CSBG/ARRA) program administered by the Office of Community Services (OCS), through compliance monitoring, technical assistance, to enhance the government financial, administrative, and programmatic reviews of CSBG/ARRA grantees identified by the Division of State Assistance (DSA).  The contractor shall be responsible for providing qualified staff (to include, but not be limited to Certified Public Accountants, auditors, financial management and program specialists) to assist in conducting such reviews.  It is envisioned that the contractor will provide a team of qualified personnel to work with OCS Federal staff to suggest improvements to the design of a monitoring system and the conduct of reviews.
b.	Successful completion of this contract will improve the administration of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) portfolio of grants, thereby enhancing ACFs stewardship of taxpayer money.  Outcomes may include recommendation to provide technical assistance to help grantees correct issues as well as decisions not to continue funding of existing grants in those instances where the grantee and/or subgrantee has not clearly and convincingly demonstrated satisfactory progress in accomplishing stated goals and objectives in its initial year or deny funding of new requests for funding to organizations where reviews have shown areas of significant concern.
c.	It is expected that the end result of the reviews will be to assist OCS in establishing internal controls that provide assurances that ARRA grantees and subgrantees are effectively and efficiently in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations and are able to effectively implement their grants.
