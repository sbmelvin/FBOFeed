<SUBJECT>Biologic Specimen Repository and Inventory Management for NCBDDD Projects
<SOLNBR>2016-N-17713
<RESPDATE>010816
<CONTACT>Liubov A. Kriel, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882856, Email vyh1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) intends to award a sole source contract to Fisher BioServices, Inc, 14665 Rothgeb Drive, Rockville, Maryland, 20850-5312 for the continuation of biologic specimen storage and inventory management services. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The North American Industrial Classification Standards (NAICS) code for this procurement is 493120, Refrigerated warehousing and storage. The work shall be performed at the Contractor's facility.<br /><br />The primary purpose of this proposed one-year bridge contract is to continue biologic specimens storage and inventory management services currently being performed by incumbent under contract 200-2010-F-37363 while the new, longer term, follow-on contract is being competed. The biological specimens have been collected under several projects including the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), and the Division of Blood Disorders' projects for the reduction and prevention of complications due to blood disorders. It is imperative that the contracted services continue without interruption. Any break in service would destroy more than 700,000 biologic specimens and severely impact or invalidate the current and future CDC research projects. Since, the NCBDDD biologic specimens are currently stored at the Fisher BioServices's facility and the contractor is already performing the specimen receipt, storage, retrieval, and shipping services, the Fisher BioServices, Inc. is the only contractor that can meet the NCBDDD's need, timeline, and is uniquely qualified to continue the contract services. Therefore, Fisher BioServices, Inc. is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Fisher BioServices, Inc. However, firms that believe they can meet these requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, by January 8, 2016. The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal request. All requests must be in writing.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Liubov Kriel by email at vyh1@cdc.gov and reference solicitation number # 2016-N-17713 on the subject line.

<RESPDATE>122815
<CONTACT>Jonathan M. Lear, Contracting Officer, Email john.lear@nih.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Bruker Biospin Corporation, 15 Fortune Drive, Billerica, MA 01821-3923 to provide maintenance services on the Avance-800 Cryogenic Probe located in the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) in accordance with the following information.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NHLBI Biochemistry and Biophysics Center located in the Division of Intramural Research carries out research that brings chemical and physical approaches to the study of biological problems. The principal investigators of the Center focus on topics that range from DNA transcription to cellular degeneration. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in these diverse processes, the investigators develop instruments and techniques to resolve, quantify, model, manipulate, and simulate biological mechanisms at molecular and cellular levels. The focus of Center research is to develop both experimental and theoretical models of biomolecular structure, and use these models to discover the link between the structure, function, and regulation of biologically active molecules and processes.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is for a contractor to provide a one year maintenance agreement for the cryogenic probe located in the NHLBI Biochemistry and Biophysics Center, which consists of a cryo-platform and a helium compressor.</p>
<p>-	Avance-800 Cryogenic Probe</p>
<p>The coverage shall include the following:</p>
<p>-	Accident damage probe replacement;<br />-	FE Coverage Weekdays: Mon-Fri, 8am-5pm;<br />-	Onsite response time within 6 hours;<br />-	Tech / Phone support;<br />-	PM Coverage: Mon-Fri, 8am-5pm;<br />-	Remote Apps Support Level-1: Mon-Fri, 8am-5pm<br />-	Repair parts included, next day<br />-	Uptime commitment; 95%</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance will be for one (1) year.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is due to the extreme sophistication, complexity, and proprietary supply of parts needed for maintenance, the Avance-800 Cryogenic Probe cannot be maintained by NIH in-house staff.</p>
<p>Bruker Biospin ensures rapid access to proprietary parts and consumables and support by field engineers who are specifically trained by the contractor to maintain the equipment they manufacture. The access, the parts, and expertise by Bruker Biospin maximizes the value of the complex and expensive probe already in place at NHLBI and satisfies the heavy experimental demands placed on this equipment.</p>
<p>Bruker Biospin is the only manufacturer that produces and integrates all of the components of the 800 Cryogenic Probe. The facility at NHLBI is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in order to meet high experimental demand. In order to maintain the instrumentation in a fully operational state, it is necessary to have a maintenance agreement with a supplier that has immediate access to parts and supplies, in addition to the technological know-how. Because Bruker Biospin manufactures all the components of the facility, they have an extensive parts list at their immediate disposal within the continental United States, and their field engineers are experts in all the components that make up the cryogenic probe platform. In addition, by having a local service engineer, they can provide coverage for the entire week (8am to 5pm), and can respond rapidly to unforeseen malfunctions.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold), and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, and the Small Business Size Standard is $20.5M. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-85 (December 4, 2015).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to purchase on sole source basis under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, Compunetix CONTEX Mission Voice Platform (MVP) series voice system. NAWCWD, China Lake, CA has a requirement to install a mission critical Voice Switch and Conferencing Systems (VSCS) with a common user interface in Operational Control Rooms (OCR) at China Lake and Point Mugu, CA to support range operations. The VSCS is a communications suite intended for use in a Range test environment for the NAWCWD at both China Lake and Point Mugu. <br />The purpose of the VSCS is to provide mission-critical voice communications for range operations. The VSCS equipment provides range users with secure and non-secure voice communications with access to radio, telephone and other multi-party conference networks. The common user interface, known as a Mission Instrument, provides range test customers with operational familiarity among all Ranges. The VSCS functions as a rapidly configurable redundant non-blocking inter-connect system providing communication services for Conference Networks, Direct Lines, Inter-Communication, and Standard Telephone Operations. <br />Currently the Atlantic Test Range (ATR) is deploying the CONTEX MVP mission-critical voice communication system at Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. In order to meet the common user interface, the NAWCWD intends to fulfill this requirement by purchasing on an other than full and open competition basis the CONTEX MVP series mission-critical voice communication system from Compunetix, Inc. in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Compunetix Mission Instrument only operates with the CONTEX MVP series voice switch system. Competitor systems do not meet the commonality requirement for operator Mission Instruments.<br />This notice of intent is for market research purposes only, and is not a request for proposals (RFP) or quotations, nor does it restrict the government as to ultimate acquisition approach. Any responses or inquiries to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. The Government will not pay for information submitted. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement action, based on responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this notice are due by 3:30 pm, Pacific Time, 01/15/2016. Email inquiries/responses to Neil Flint, Purchasing Agent, at neil.flint@navy.mil.. Information provided will become Government property and will not be returned to contractors.

<DESC>This special notice serves to answer a Question that came in that was pertinent to the updated proposal due date.  The question and answer will be incorporated into Amendment 0002 once executed after 4 January 2016.  The Question and Answer is below:

â€œNow that the Past Performance volume is not due until January 22, does this mean that Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) are not due from our customers until January 22 as well? Also, because of the due date extension, would the Government consider extending the PPQ distribution requirement from 2 weeks to 3 weeks (December 31)?â€

Government Response:

â€œYes, that is correct; PPQs will now not be due from customers until 22 January 2016.
  The Government will allow distribution from 2 weeks to 3 weeks.â€

Please note, all other questions received will not be answered until after 4 January 2016.  Thank you.

STATEMENT OF WORK 	
STATEMENT of WORK and Functional Performance

1.   Introduction

A highly specialized device that weighs only 2 grams and captures brain activity from mice. This is a breakthrough technology that allows researchers to record brain activity without impeding the behavior of the animal. The pattern of signals are received via a proprietary miniature microscope device .
 
This device will not connect with the VA network.
The wireless signal is very low strength and is visible only over a 4m radius. It can only be captured with proprietary equipment; not cell phones.

The VA will own this equipment.
We anticipate that the lifecycle will be 10years.
Windows compatible computer (Win7) will integrate the data.
The data is electrical brain activity from rodents and therefore not sensitive data.


2.	Background
A severe limitation in our current experimental paradigm is that it is not possible to record the animal's brain activity under certain conditions such as under alcohol intoxication, or memory tasks. Therefore, by not allowing the animals to engage in complete freedom of behavior we are only getting a limited view of brain function.

There is now available a breakthrough technology that allows researchers to record brain activity without impeding the behavior of the animal. The pattern of signals is received via a proprietary device that incorporates a miniature microscope that can peer deep within the brain of mice.

With this device we can record brain activity while the mouse moves about and engages in normal activity. Thus, the mouse is able to drink, eat, behave and sleep normally. Currently, we cannot record mice behavior under certain conditions or environments because of the tethering.

An important feature of this integrated equipment is that it is turn-key and user-friendly. This allows investigators to operate the equipment on their own. Nevertheless, each investigator will be given initial training by the vendor on the use of the system, and its capabilities.
3.	Scope:

a.	The device must enable live imaging of rodent brain activity.
b.	Hardware must be able to decode the signal and graphically present it.


4.	Applicable Directives:
           It cannot connect independently with the internet.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

(b) A complete copy of all GAO or Court of Federal Claims protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon (i) the Contracting Officer, and (ii) the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel, within one day of filing a protest with either GAO or the Court of Federal Claims. (c) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C.

The level of contract risk will determine the type and scope of such processing, as noted below. (1) Investigative requirements for Non-IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk?Moderate Background Investigation (MBI). (2) Investigative requirements for IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (b) In addition to the investigations noted above, non-U.S. citizens must have a pre-appointment check that includes an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. (c) Additional Requirements for Foreign Nationals (Non-U.S. Citizens). To be employed under this contract within the United States, non-U.S. citizens must have: (1) Official legal status in the United States; (2) Continuously resided in the United States for the last two years; and (3) Obtained advance approval from the servicing Security Officer of the contracting operating unit in consultation with the DOC Office of Security (OSY) headquarters. (OSY routinely consults with appropriate agencies regarding the use of non-U.S. citizens on contracts and can provide up-to-date information concerning this matter.) <BR> <BR>(d) Security Processing Requirement. Processing requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts are as follows: (1) The contractor must complete and submit the following forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): (i) Standard Form 85P (SF-85P), Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions; (ii) FD-258, Fingerprint Chart with OPM's designation in the ORI Block; and (iii) Credit Release Authorization. (2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion. (e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified. The Sponsor, in coordination with the Contracting Officer, will immediately remove the contract employee from duties requiring access to Departmental facilities or IT systems. Contract employees may be barred from working on the premises of a facility for any of the following: (1) Conviction of a felony crime of violence or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (2) Falsification of information entered on security screening forms or on other documents submitted to the Department; (3) Improper conduct once performing on the contract, including criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct or other conduct prejudicial to the Government, regardless of whether the conduct was directly related to the contract; (4) Any behavior judged to pose a potential threat to Departmental information systems, personnel, property, or other assets. (f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

<p>Quoters must first meet the above minimum acceptability factors before the quote will be further evaluated on the following technical factors.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS, listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />FACTOR 1. PAST PERFORMANCE: The quoter shall provide references from contracts of <br />a similar scope which shows evidence of quoter's ability to accomplish the required work. Information must be submitted that shows quoter has maintained a Gulfstream GIV-SP aircraft within the past 12 months. Include descriptions of past performance on providing work related to the line items. The quoter should include the name of the customer, including address, phone number, contract number, type of contract, and dollar value, date of contract, period of performance, place of performance, and brief description of work scope and responsibilities including the "N" number of the aircraft on which work was/is performed.<br />FACTOR 2. STAFF EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATION: The quoter shall describe its overall staff experience, its ability to accomplish the inspections, plus scheduled maintenance items and repair of aircraft.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />TRAWL NET REPAIR <br />MODIFICATION #1:
<p>REQUEST FOR QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS CHANGE:<br />Please separate your bid into base estimates and options as specified below.</p>
<p>Base Estimate #1: Fixed cost per net to conduct assessment and develop pricing to repair and otherwise refurbish as needed to meet specifications (based on assessment).<br />Base Estimate #2: Fixed hourly cost for labor for repairs on nets.<br />Base Estimate #3: Fixed cost per repaired net to conduct a review for repair certification with AFSC point of contact - for each net that meets specifications, reattach footrope, bundle and prepare for delivery.</p>
<p>Option #1: What I envision is that once the vendor completes the work under the first base task for all nets of a single type, then they can provide the costs of materials and estimate(s) of labor to effect repairs on each net. This would be time and materials. The government then would work with the vendor to decide whether or not to proceed with the repairs on each and every net depending on the vendors assessment of what was needed to repair, and the total expenditures to that point.</p>
<p>Option #2: Cost to deliver completed nets to AFSC WRC in mutually agreed lots and schedule. (Not all nets will be delivered at same time). The vendor could quote a fixed cost for delivery of each type of net knowing how many they can get on their truck and the number of trips it would take."</p>
<p>A labor rate and fixed margin for materials is acceptable for bidding on the repair portion of this RFP. We would still need a fixed cost estimate for:<br />&bull; Conducting the damage assessment and developing pricing to repair and otherwise refurbish each net as needed to meet specifications <br />&bull; Conducting the review of each repaired net for certification with AFSC point of contact, reattaching the footrope, bundle and prepare for delivery.<br />&bull; Delivery</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>CAR 1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER PROJECT/TASK NUMBER ESTIMATED AMOUNT</p>
<p>21-16-446PCZ141</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED, AND THE INTENDED USE:</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard C3CEN ERF has a requirement, on a sole source basis, for the purchase of electronic repair and replacement parts to be used in centralized depot repair of U.S. Coast Guard Electronic Equipment, specifically the Engine Start Electronic Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) that is a part of the 110' Class Cutter Marine Propulsion System. A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of: thirty (30) each, Variable Delay Timers, part number 79-201/02; twenty-five (25) each, Variable Delay Timers, part number 79-201/01; both manufactured by Man Diesel Turbo North America, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of these parts. The parts requested are exact replacements that make up the Engine Start Electronic Circuit Card that is a part of the 110' Class Marine Propulsion System.</p>
<p>UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:</p>
<p>The OEM specifications for these items are proprietary commercial property. The Coast Guard did not purchase this information when Marine Propulsion Control Systems for 110' Class Cutters were originally purchased. Man Diesel &amp; Turbo North America, Inc. originally manufactured the Delay Timers and Flasher Assembly components found in the Engine Start CCA of the 110' Class Marine Propulsion Control System. Adequate item information, documentation, and specifications are not available to develop an appropriate purchase description for full and open competition. Man Diesel is the only known provider meeting system requirements for form, fit, function, configuration, records, and integration with the installed Marine Propulsion Control System, Engine Stop CCA's. Any variances could cause catastrophic damage to the ships' propulsion systems and pose a serious safety risk to ships' crews.</p>
<p>REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:</p>
<p>Market research as prescribed in FAR Part 10 was conducted by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The Internet was searched using part numbers and item names for a list of manufacturers/vendors that could provide time delay relays and flasher modules; several companies were contacted and no one could meet the OEM specification. The market research showed that only Man Diesel could provide replacement parts that meet the minimum technical specifications to ensure compatibility with existing electronic and mechanical circuitry and to ensure that safe operational parameters are maintained.</p>
<p><br />EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The material technical specifications and supplementary data are proprietary to the OEM and cannot be provided to other manufacturers, which eliminates any opportunities for full and open competition. The ships' propulsion control system is critical for safe navigation. Changes in design could lead to malfunction jeopardizing the safety of the ships and crews.</p>
<p>PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED:</p>
<p>Recommend no actions be taken at this time to overcome barriers barring full and open competition.</p>

<p>Collaborative Opportunities with Sandia National Laboratories for Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Power Cycle Bearings</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background Information:</strong></span></p>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), with Department of Energy (DOE) sponsorship, has made substantial contributions over the last decade to the development of supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) Brayton power cycles. Supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycles provide industry value through increased efficiency and a smaller overall system footprint compared to industry standard steam-based power conversion cycles. By the end of fiscal year 2019 SNL intends to develop a 10 MWe R&amp;D demonstration sCO2 Brayton power conversion system. SNL seeks to engage with vendors on development of key system components in an effort to retire technical risks for fast track commercial system deployment.<br /> <br />Recognizing the potentially significant advantages of greater efficiency in power cycles, SNL in 2006 developed a laboratory-scale test assembly to establish the viability of the underlying science and demonstrate system performance. To date SNL has designed and developed sCO2 Brayton power cycles up to 1 MWth, generated over 100 kWh of energy, verified cycle performance, and developed cycle controls and maintenance procedures. The test assembly has successfully operated in different configurations (simple Brayton, waste heat cycle, and recompression) and tested additives to the sCO2 working fluid. Challenges remain to (1) confirm viability of existing components and suitability of materials, (2) demonstrate that theoretical efficiencies are achievable, and (3) integrate and scale up existing technologies to be suitable for a range of commercial applications.<br /> <br />Appropriate selection and design of bearings are paramount to sCO2 Brayton cycle turbomachinery performance and reliability. Large scale sCO2 systems will likely employ fluid film (hydrodynamic oil, hydrostatic) or magnetic bearings. While the upfront cost for these bearing types is high, their characteristic start-up and running friction profiles, velocity and load limits, and projected lifetime are more suitable for sCO2 power systems than other bearing types. The main technical challenge for sCO2 power cycle bearings is in scalability for use in a 10 MWe system.  Bearings for this application must withstand the sCO2 environment, perform at temperatures of at least 540&#730;C, accommodate a shaft diameter greater than 1 inch at speeds up to 40,000 rpm, and endeavor to meet reliability requirements for power cycle commercial deployment.</p>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opportunity Description:</strong></span></p>
<p>SNL is seeking proposals for collaborative partnerships from a U.S. company or companies to advance sCO2 power cycle bearings and foster growth for U.S. industry. This will be a partnership between SNL and selected industry partners, through which we intend to create or improve sCO2 technologies applicable to U.S. manufacturing or commercialization. Potential areas of collaboration include but are not limited to bearing design, testing, modeling and validation. Collaboration efforts must utilize SNL Subject Matter Experts. The conditions for this collaboration can be finalized through the creation of a specific Statement of Work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Funding information:</strong></em> Selected partners will be responsible for funding any materials or equipment purchases required for the collaboration. The Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is the mechanism that facilitates collaborative work with SNL; however if there is a specific deliverable or service that a selected partner would like Sandia to perform in a non-collaborative fashion, then the proper mechanism would be a Strategic Partnership Project (SPP).  A decision to utilize a CRADA or a SPP will be mutual and be based upon the negotiated Statement of Work. The award period will be negotiated after the proposal selection process is completed. Any intellectual property developed by the selected partner during the course of this agreement will be retained solely by the partner. Selected partners will also have the option to negotiate up to and including an exclusive license to any new intellectual property developed jointly with or solely by SNL during the course of the partnership. Please see "Technology Partnerships" for a description of the various types of partnerships and agreements available.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What SNL Brings to the Partnership:</strong></span></p>
<p>The Brayton team at SNL has expertise and capabilities from the development of sCO2 recuperated closed Brayton cycle (RCBC) systems up to 1 MWth which can be leveraged to enable U.S. manufacturers in development of marketable system components. The collaborative relationship is intended to pair our models and facilities with interested vendors in development of bearing prototypes with a technology readiness level (TRL) suitable for use in a 10 MWe demonstration Brayton power conversion system. These collaborative partnerships may result in the use of SNL expertise in design, modeling, and characterization to better understand the operation of bearing designs or prototypes under unique conditions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Proposals Sought:</strong></span></p>
<p>Concept proposals are anticipated to be brief (up to 5 pages). The following information is being requested. Interested parties may provide additional relevant information as needed.<br />&bull;Description of the technical problem and proposed solution. <br />&bull;The need for Sandia National Laboratories' expertise and resources to solve the technical problem.<br />&bull;A succinct statement of work (SOW), expected funding needs, and potential timeline.<br />&bull;Description of the relevant experience, expertise, and capabilities of the interested party. <br />&bull;Description of any past experience partnering with Research and Development organizations such as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), Universities, National Laboratories, or Government Laboratories.</p>
<p>More detailed information may be requested during the review process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Instructions to Responders:</strong></span><br /> <br />Interested parties that meet the Mandatory Requirements provided below are invited to respond to this opportunity for collaboration. Any and all responses are voluntary and Sandia will not pay for any information submitted in response to this opportunity for collaboration. Responses should be emailed to Darryn Fleming at ddflemi@sandia.gov by January 31st, 2016. Responses should include the Collaboration Opportunity title and the submitting organization's name in the subject line. Any attachments should not exceed 5MB; only document formats with a .docx, .doc, or .pdf suffix will be accepted. Questions may be submitted to the same email.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong></span></p>
<p>In addition to evaluating the proposals for their technical content and viability, SNL will evaluate all responses and select prospective parties to engage in further discussions based on the following criteria:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mandatory:</strong></span><br />&bull;U.S. firms willing and able to enter into a partnerships agreement with SNL, such as a CRADA, SPP, etc.<br />&bull;Firms must be able to ensure products developed as a result of this partnership are manufactured largely in the United States by U.S. citizens at U.S. owned and controlled companies.<br />&bull;Compliance with Federal Export Control requirements per the Department of State. <br />&bull;Ability to provide in-kind support and collaborate on specific activities as defined within a Statement of Work developed jointly with the interested party and SNL.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Desired:</strong></span><br />&bull;Demonstrated successful partnering and teaming relationships with R&amp;D organizations. <br />&bull;Demonstrated experience, expertise, and capabilities in the design, development, and manufacturing of bearings, including demonstrated ability to design for manufacturability.<br />&bull;Development of novel approaches to bearings for sCO2 Brayton power cycle technologies.</p>
<p>SNL will consider teaming arrangements where two or more companies may form a team to satisfy the Desired Requirements.</p>

Current film-riding face seal technology is functional at lower speeds and significantly lower temperatures and would require active cooling for use in efficient sCO2 power systems. Alternatives include switching to high temperature materials or development of entirely new products.</p>

<p>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), with Department of Energy (DOE) sponsorship, has made substantial contributions over the last decade to the development of supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) Brayton power cycles. Supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycles provide industry value through increased efficiency and a smaller overall system footprint compared to industry standard steam-based power conversion cycles. By the end of fiscal year 2019 SNL intends to develop a 10 MWe R&amp;D demonstration sCO2 Brayton power conversion system. SNL seeks to engage with vendors on development of key system components in an effort to retire technical risks for fast track commercial system deployment. <br /> <br />Recognizing the potentially significant advantages of greater efficiency in power cycles, SNL in 2006 developed a laboratory-scale test assembly to establish the viability of the underlying science and demonstrate system performance. To date SNL has designed and developed sCO2 Brayton power cycles up to 1 MWth, generated over 100 kWh of energy, verified cycle performance, and developed cycle controls and maintenance procedures. The test assembly has successfully operated in different configurations (simple Brayton, waste heat cycle, and recompression) and tested additives to the sCO2 working fluid. Challenges remain to (1) confirm viability of existing components and suitability of materials, (2) demonstrate that theoretical efficiencies are achievable, and (3) integrate and scale up existing technologies to be suitable for a range of commercial applications.<br /> <br />Heat exchangers are the most critical component in sCO2 RCBCs due to cost and because the cycle efficiency is dependent on large amounts of recuperation and heat transfer. By reducing the amount of external heating and cooling required, internal heat transfer through recuperation allows for the high efficiencies that make sCO2 RCBCs competitive with conventional steam Rankine cycles. In additional to standard process heaters and coolers, a typical cycle layout includes high and low temperature recuperators that transfer 2-3 times the equivalent electrical power produced. Domestic cost effective heat exchanger technology that can reach these efficiencies at 650&#730;C and 7.5MPa has yet to be realized.<br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opportunity Description:</strong></span></p>
<p>SNL is seeking proposals for collaborative partnerships from a U.S. company or companies to advance sCO2 power cycle heat exchangers and foster growth for U.S. industry. This will be a partnership between SNL and selected industry partners, through which we intend to create or improve sCO2 technologies applicable to U.S. manufacturing or commercialization. Potential areas of collaboration include but are not limited to heat exchanger design, testing, modeling and validation. Interested companies are preferred but not required to have experience and expertise in common heat exchanger manufacturing techniques such as plate forming, mechanical and electromechanical machining, stainless steel and nickel alloy welding, brazing, diffusion bonding, etc. Experience in design and manufacture of vessels to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section VIII requirements is also desired. Collaboration efforts must utilize SNL Subject Matter Experts, the conditions which can be finalized through the creation of a specific Statement of Work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Funding information:</strong></em> Selected partners will be responsible for funding any materials or equipment purchases required for the collaboration. The Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is the mechanism that facilitates collaborative work with SNL; however if there is a specific deliverable or service that a selected partner would like Sandia to perform in a non-collaborative fashion, then the proper mechanism would be a Strategic Partnership Project (SPP).  A decision to utilize a CRADA or a SPP will be mutual and be based upon the negotiated Statement of Work. The award period will be negotiated after the proposal selection process is completed. Any intellectual property developed by the selected partner during the course of this agreement will be retained solely by the partner. Selected partners will also have the option to negotiate up to and including an exclusive license to any new intellectual property developed jointly with or solely by SNL during the course of the partnership. Please see "Technology Partnerships" for a description of the various types of partnerships and agreements available.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What SNL Brings to the Partnership:</strong></span></p>
<p>The Brayton team at SNL has expertise and capabilities from the development of sCO2 recuperated closed Brayton cycle (RCBC) systems up to 1 MWth which can be leveraged to enable U.S. manufacturers in development of marketable system components. The collaborative relationship is intended to pair our models and facilities with interested vendors in development of bearing prototypes with a technology readiness level (TRL) suitable for use in a 10 MWe demonstration Brayton power conversion system. These collaborative partnerships may result in the use of SNL expertise in design, modeling, and characterization to better understand the operation of heat exchanger designs or prototypes under unique conditions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Proposals Sought:</strong></span></p>

This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements described. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort.

They shall be expressly prohibited from scoring, ranking, or recommending the selection of a source. <br />b. The government is responsible for proper safeguards to ensure proposal evaluation objectivity. In this regard, the government exclusively retains all source selection decision authority and supporting decision responsibilities. Moreover, all participants in the proposal review process with access to source selection sensitive information are required to execute a government nondisclosure agreement. <br />c. Government support contractors who may be involved in review of proposals submitted in response to this solicitation are identified as follows: <br />Ms. Lora Mackin government contractor for Roger P.

POC: Mr. Gregory R. Anderson, Director of Contracts, Email: ganderson@gcsinfo.com.<br />d. Offerors who submit proposals in response to this solicitation do so with the express understanding that government support contractors serving as advisors in the proposal review process may have access to the Offerors' proposal information, as described above. Offerors requiring nondisclosure agreements with any government support contractor are not relieved of solicitation submission time requirements, nor is the government required to provide additional time to Offerors requiring their own bilateral nondisclosure agreements with any government support contractor. <br />e. Offerors requiring nondisclosure agreements with any government support contractor shall: <br />(i) Inform the contracting officer of the Offeror's requirement; <br />(ii) Contact the government support contractor and negotiate the necessary terms and conditions and obtain the contractor's written agreement; <br />(iii) Provide a signed copy of each such nondisclosure agreement executed to the contracting officer with their proposal submission; and <br />(iv) Indicate in the proposal that the support contractor(s) may utilize the Offeror's proprietary data in evaluating the Offeror's proposal. <br />f. The Offeror shall notify their prospective subcontractors who are submitting proprietary information that the above government support contractors may require similar access to this information. Any such subcontractors may execute agreements directly with the above government support contractors or may authorize an Offeror to permit such access on such reasonable terms as the subcontractor may provide. For each such subcontractor agreement executed, Offerors shall provide a copy of such agreements with their proposal, and shall indicate in the proposal that the government support contractor(s) may utilize subcontractor proprietary data in evaluating the subcontractor's proposal for this acquisition. <br />(End of Provision)</p>
