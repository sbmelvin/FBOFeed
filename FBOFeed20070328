<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center's Flight Safety Branch intends to award a single source contract to ONERA (Office National d'Etudes et Recherches AÃ©rospatiales) for two days (17 hours) of aerodynamic testing on a full scale model in the F1 Wind Tunnel in Toulouse, France.  This requirement is being processed using limitation of sources to a single source as provided for under the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) Sections 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.4. The model is a 2D rectangular wing having a NACA 23012 airfoil cross-section, weighing approximately 2,300 Kg (5,060 lbs).  The chord length is 1828.8 mm (72.00 inches) and the span is 3492 mm (137.48-inches).   The scope includes testing at conditions with flight Reynolds numbers with Mach number independently controlled. A market survey conducted determined that the F1 tunnel is the only facility that can both accommodate the model and achieve flight Reynolds numbers while independently controlling Mach number. The survey taken researched the following tunnels in the United States and Canada and found them to unaccomadate the 12 foot model and couldn't control Reynolds number and Mach number independently: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Low Turbulence Pressure Tunnel (LTPT) at NASA Langley Kirsten Wind Tunnel at University of Washington Beech Wind Tunnel at Wichita State University Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel at University of Maryland The 0.3 M Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel at NASA Langley Trisonic Blowdown Tunnel of the Nat'l Research Council of Canada Any questions should be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer, Jeanine Passetti via email at jeanine.passetti@faa.gov.

THIS IS A SYNOPSIS AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2 – THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  VENDORS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT FORMAL PROPOSALS UNTIL THE RFP IS POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE.  45 CONS/LGCB has a requirement for a professionally structured writing skills program at the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI).  The Military Writing Skills Program (MWSP) is an academically structured military writing program specifically designed to improve the military writing skills of DEOMI’s Equal Opportunity Advisor Course (EOAC) students.  The course concept is designed and intended to be a freshman-level, technical writing class for military members.  This assumes some degree of proficiency/skill on the part of the students such as a fundamental grasp of grammar and sentence structure rules.  Although focus is on basic grammar, structure, and style of writing, the goal should be to adapt these lessons to the military style of writing and prepare all future Equal Opportunity Advisors to function in a staff environment.  The Writing Improvement Network (WIN) classes are intended to assist those students who need additional fundamental training.  The WIN’s focus is on re-emphasizing the basic grammar, structure, and styles of writing.  It aims to be a more informal tutorial approach.  This program in its entirety shall provide students with a foundation of military writing skills to prepare them for the written communication requirements they are expected to encounter as Equal Opportunity Advisors.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform a professionally structured Military Writing Skills Program that will be defined in a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) provided within the solicitation.  This service will be conducted at Patrick AFB, FL.  The period of performance dates will be 28 June – 31 December 2007.  The government intends to make a single award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.  Solicitation No. FA2521-07-T-0122 is issued as a Request for Proposal.  It is advertised with a Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 8299, business size of $6.5M and a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611710.

<DESC>The Marine corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) intends to award a follow-on, sole source contract to CRAFCO, Inc to provide; (1) 3,000 gallons of new reliable CQS emulsion compatible with CRAFCO equipment currently in Iraq,(2) two (2) each emulsion transfer pumps compatible with the CRAFCO installed 3,000 gallon emulsion storage tanks currently located in Iraq, (3) necessary repair parts for one CRAFCO Trailer-Mounted Magnum Injection Spray Patcher unit that was damaged upon arrival in Iraq, and (4) a manufacture training representative to accompany the MCWL Project Officer to Iraq for a period of two (2) weeks to conduct additional operator/maintenance training and equipment repair on the equipment currently in Iraq.  NOTE 22 APPLY. SCOPE. MCWL was approached by Marine Forces operating in Iraq with a force protection and logistical dilemma.  As a result of repeated roadside improvised explosive device (RSIED) attacks on our forces, Marines have had to take on the additional mission of repairing craters within the roads caused by IED explosions.  The IED roadside craters must be carefully repaired in order to prevent additional emplacement of IEDs back into the same holes.  This added mission has created both a force protection and logistical issue for these forces, as they are not equipped with the specialized equipment to efficiently accomplish this mission.  Instead, the Marines have had to adapt to the evolving mission using forty (40) Marines, ten (10) vehicles (three 7-ton trucks with trailers, two dump trucks, and five high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles ((HMMWVs)), and a mix of different construction materials.  It takes the aforementioned team of Marines approximately 40 – 90 minutes to !  repair the average hole — exclusive of the requirement to leave a security force in overwatch for another 60-90 minutes to ensure that the filler gets hard enough to prevent an insurgent from putting another improvised explosive devise (IED) in the filler mix. In search of a way to accomplish this mission with a significantly reduced footprint (people, equipment, materiel and time) MCWL conducted exhaustive market research that included significant interaction with the Marine Corps Engineer School, Marine Corps Center for Lessons Learned (MCCLL), Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) and in-depth discussions with recent returnees from Iraq who were involved in repairing IED holes as late as 26 February 2006. We also had discussions with representatives in the Departments of Transportation in Texas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Virginia as well as extensive dialog and exchange of emails with paving experts in construction companies in Texas (Ramming Paving) and Indiana (Turn!  er Construction) BACKGROUND. During September 2006, MCWL executed contract M67854-06-C-5086, on a sole source basis with CRAFCO Inc, eight to purchase eight Trailer-Mounted Injection Spray Patcher Systems, two 3,000 gallon emulsion storage tanks, and associated spare parts. The systems were delivered to Iraq at Multi National Forces West (MNF-W) locations for an extended user evaluation (EUE).  The original EUE in MNF-W was scheduled to start during September 2006 following the equipment delivery, installation and training.  The EUE did not start due to problems with proper aggregate and the late delivery of emulsion from Turkey. When the Turkish emulsion finally arrived, MNF-W was not able to proceed with the EUE due to emulsion curing problems.   The plan to restart the EUE will require MCWL to purchase CONUS based emulsion, have it delivered to MNF-W and send a manufacturer representative back to Iraq as part of a MCWL mobile training team for a new round of operator/maintenance training. This Statement of Work (SOW) below delineates the tasks to be performed to support the continued efforts of the fighting forces in Iraq to combat the deadly destruction of Marines and other coalition forces through the use IEDs.  TASK DESCRIPTION.      Task One:  Contractor shall provide 3,000 gallons of new reliable Continental United States (CONUS) based Cationic Rapid Set Two (CRS-2) emulsion and ship the CRS-2 to Camp Lejeune, NC for subsequent shipment to Multi-National Forces-West in Iraq. Task Two:  Contractor shall provide two (2) emulsion transfer pumps to transfer emulsion liquid from delivered drums/totes/tank truck into the installed 3,000 gallon CRAFCO emulsion storage tanks and ship the pumps to Camp Lejeune, NC for subsequent shipment to Multi-National Forces-West in Iraq. Task Three: Contractor shall provide the necessary repair parts for one CRAFCO Trailer-Mounted Magnum Injection Spray Patcher unit damaged during off-loading in Iraq and ship the repair parts to Camp Lejeune, NC for subsequent shipment to Multi-National Forces-West in Iraq.   Task Four:  Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel with the requisite skills to accompany MCWL Project Officer to Iraq in order to conduct additional operator/maintenance training and to provide contractor support services in the repair of damaged equipment for Multi-National Forces-West in Iraq for a period of two weeks  Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability via email to Ira D. Patterson referencing the following tracking #9028. These should be submitted on or before 30 April 2007. This synopsis should not be considered a as commitment of any kind by the Government.

NASA/JSC has a requirement for a follow-on completion form contract for the essential engineering expertise, systems design and operations knowledge, and the maintenance and production capabilities needed by NASA/JSC to effectively support SVS operational activities related to the Space Shuttle Program.  The SVS enables astronauts to perform precise positioning of objects attached to the Space Shuttle and Space Station robotic arms.  It accomplishes the positioning by processing camera video and generating positioning information for display to the robotic operator.  The SVS is planned to be awarded as part of the same contract as the Laser Camera System (LCS).  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)/Neptec Design Group Limited on a sole source basis.  CCC/Neptec is currently providing support under contract NNJ06VA03C.  The period of performance for this contract is December 12, 2005 through November 30, 2007.  Neptec has also performed this effort under contract NAS9-01183.  The period of performance of this contract was October of 2001 through December of 2005.  Current market research indicates that Neptec is the design authority and sole manufacturer of the SVS, and has exclusive licenses from the National Research Council for the patents involved in the equipment.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is advertising a research opportunity to invite proposals for the development of technology that supports the Globally Networked Maritime Headquarters with Maritime Operations Center (G-N MHQw/MOC) for planning and operational execution of plans. This Naval concept addresses the globally distributed nature of maritime operations and the need for new approaches to the problems this reality presents.  Joint doctrine development also addresses some of these issues in the concept of the Joint and Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander (J/CFMCC).  These concepts are related, and the J/CFMCC concept is included in the more broadly scoped MHQw/MOC.   In fact, the FORCEnet Enabling Capability (EC) in support of which this BAA is issued as FNT08-06 Globally Networked Joint & Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander (G-N J/CFMCC).  The program to develop needed technologies identified by the EC and addressed in this BAA is entitled: Globally Networked Maritime Headquarters with Maritime Operations Center (G-N MHQw/MOC). 

Two concepts of operations are relevant to the research opportunity : (1) MHQw/MOC) Concept of Operations (CONOPS), Draft Version 2.4, 31 Oct 2006); and (2) Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) TACMEMO 3-32-06 Final Draft June 2006.  Offerors and interested parties should consult these documents before responding to the research opportunity described in this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number 07-021.  Section VII of this BAA contains information about how to obtain a copy of the documents. Section VII, Subsection 3.0 provides more discussion on the relationship between this research program and the J/CFMCC and MHQw/MOC concept evolution including the capability gaps that have motivated the program thrusts.  Potential offerors should read Section VII to understand the context of this research initiative.

Proposed capabilities for the G-N MHQw/MOC should be capable of providing support to the seamless global operation of the Plans, Future Operations, and Current Operations cells.  The operations of these cells are described in NWDC TACMEMO 3-32-06, Sections 3.4 and 3.6.  Potential offerors should ensure that their white paper, oral presentation (if invited), and full proposal (if invited) address specifically how their technology offering will enhance the capabilities of the Plans, Future Operations, and Current Operations cells.  

This ONR research opportunity relates to the operational level of war, focusing on capabilities to enhance naval forces' plans, future operations, and current operations. BAA Number# 07-021 does not focus on tactical level technology capabilities or technologies supporting warfare execution.  Neither is BAA Number # 07-021 interested in technologies that will assist in purely administrative tasks, such as managing personnel or logistics, nor those supporting intelligence center operations alone. Certainly tactical, administrative and intelligence data and information are critical to planning and decision making in the MHQw/MOC  or J/CFMCC context and must be considered as critical sources of sensor data and information, so  reference to such may be made.  Technology proposals that focus exclusively on tactical level execution, administrative tasks, or intelligence functionality and fail to address command, control and planning at the operational level will not be considered responsive to this BAA. 

Potential offerors should incorporate experimentation with technology as a significant part of the technology development effort.  They should plan for table-top experimentation within six months of contract award to enable warfighters and acquisition program partners to engage in discussion of how the technology development will enhance warfighting.  They should plan for limited technology experimentation in twelve to fourteen months after contract award, to demonstrate to acquisition program of record partners how technologies will integrate with existing and planned systems that will support MHQw/MOC and J/CFMCC capabilities.  They should plan for limited objective experimentation, including participation in a Sea Trial event, in the last four months of the base period of contract performance to enable warfighters and acquisition program partners to witness that the technology development metrics have been met.

<CONTACT>JAMES E. WESLEY II, Contract Specialist, Phone: 919 541 4826, E-Mail: wesley.james@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with North Carolina State University, P.O. Box 7909,Raleigh, NC 27695 to provide metal analyses by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) for Human Nail Samples. Several factors justify the request for processing without full and open competition.  First, analytical work to be performed under this Request for Services is a continuation of work performed by US EPA investigators using Nuclear Energy Services, Department of Nuclear Engineering, North Carolina State University, as the provider of neutron activation analysis services.  Also NC State University developed the Standard method for the determination of metals for environmental samples using neutron actviation analysis gamma spectrometry for EPA.  Under a previous EPA requirement NC State Nuclear Services analyzed water and human samples collected from Inner Mongolia, China.   In order to compare the data directly with previous data related to the same human population, it is critical that the new samples of human nails analyzed by the same laboratory.  Service from the same laboratory will ensure consistency and comparability of data. EPA believes that the North Carolina State University, is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirements.   The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".   The period of performance for the service contract is expected to be Eighteen(18) months from date of award.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities, qualifications, and how they would be useful to perform the proposed requirement in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement.   The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.  Submit any responses to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: James E. Wesley (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>This synopsis amends a pre-solicitation announcement made Oct 16, 2006 for repairs of up to 15 each AE1107C aircraft gas turbine engines. Sole-source delivery orders will be issued under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-04-G-0015 with Rolls-Royce Corp. of Indianapolis, IN for tear down, inspection, repair, and test of additional AE1107C commercial engines.  The work is anticipated to be performed over the next 6 months.  Depot-level repair services are anticipated for damaged engines determined to be excluded from maintenance support covering normal wear and tear under a Power-by-the- Hour (PBTH) maintenance contract.  Concurrently with the performance of excluded repairs, Rolls-Royce will also perform maintenance work covered by the existing PBTH contract (e.g., incorporation of Class II ECPs, incorporation of reliability improvements, performance of Service Bulletins, and replacement of life-limited parts) in order to maximize efficiency and minimize the time an engine remains “off wing” and unavailable for military deployment.  The estimated value of these additional engines repairs is $14M.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS.  The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio,  Balanced Scorecard,  Enterprise Warehouse,  Supply Chain Management,  Activity Based Management,  GL, and AM modules A full description of the software maintenance services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for Mythics.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from Mythics, the firm that is certified to resell software support by Oracle/Peoplesoft.  Software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.   ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>ADDED DETAIL OF ANNUAL MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT.<BR><BR>

Description This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.   This is a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation issue date TBD and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection will be considered as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and, therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis.  Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor’s personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war.  The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008).  The Government anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  
Current technical data for this requirement will be posted on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website at https://www.fedteds.gov/.  Currently, this is the only technical data available for this effort and no Air Force Technical Orders or Instructions are available for this project.  There is a VENDOR USER GUIDE available on the FedTeDS website.  The government request interested parties to review the technical information on FedTeds and provide us with opinions whether there is adequate information available to develop and submit a proposal for this requirement. 
It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.  As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil . Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.                                              
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.              
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause)

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: DHS - Customs and Border Protection, Office of Field Operations, Cargo and Conveyance Security Division, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 2.2A, Washington, DC, 20229

Executive Summary: The ?SAFE? Port Act (P.L. 109-347), as signed by the President on October 13, 2006, calls for CBP to develop a 1-year Third Party Validation Pilot Program for third party entities to conduct validations under the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT).  As outlined in Section 218 of the Act, CBP has developed the requirements and standard operating procedures, which a third party validator must meet to be eligible for this pilot program.  This announcement outlines the operation of the pilot program, as developed by CBP in consultation with the Commercial Operations Advisory Committee (COAC).  

Background:  Currently, all  C-TPAT validations of member companies are conducted by CBP Supply Chain Security Specialists (SCSSs).  Lesser trade facilitation benefits are afforded to certified members (Tier 1), while validated members (Tier 2 and 3) receive increased benefits, including reduced cargo examinations.  

Although ultimate responsibility for certifying the security and integrity of an international supply chain needs to reside with the U.S. Government, there may be cases where the use of a 3rd party to aid in the validation process would be beneficial.  CBP believes that China is a viable candidate for the Third Party Validation Pilot Program since CBP SCSSs are currently not granted access into China by the Chinese government.   This presents a significant problem to the C-TPAT program in its efforts to determine a C-TPAT member?s commitment to C-TPAT and to verify its degree of compliance to the minimum-security criteria of the C-TPAT program.

Data from 2006 indicates that 55 C-TPAT importer partners currently have exclusive supply chains from China, or 100% of imports originating from China.  An additional 245 C-TPAT importers source over 75% of their imports from China.  

As a result of the inability for CBP to gain access to China to validate these supply chains, C-TPAT importers sourcing from China are given the lowest level of C-TPAT benefits, since CBP is unable to validate or verify their supply chain security practices.  
Until these supply chains have been validated in China, these companies and their Chinese suppliers will be at a competitive disadvantage.  Other C-TPAT members who  import from other countries outside of China will receive greater trade facilitation benefits, such as reduced number of inspections, front of the line inspections, and shorter wait-times at the border. 

CBP has compiled a list of importers who source 75 percent or more of their imports from China, eligible to volunteer for the pilot program.  CBP will notify these importers of their eligibility to participate in the pilot program via the C-TPAT Security Link Web Portal and solicit any volunteers. 

Location
China, with travel within China and the region as needed, directed, and approved by CBP.

Time/Date
This pilot program will remain active up to twelve calendar months, starting on or about May 1, 2007 and ending on or about May 1, 2008.

Third Party Requirements and Duties Performed
Under the announcement, third-party entities may be utilized to augment or assist CBP in validating or verifying the supply chains of C-TPAT members sourcing from China. 

CBP will certify a company?s ability to qualify as a third party entity to conduct C-TPAT validations. The following requirements listed below and further described in the attached Standard Operation Procedures ? Customs and Border Protection Third Party Validation Pilot Program (attachment 1) must be met in order to be considered under this announcement:

?	Provide CBP with documentation attesting to its established presence in China.
?	Demonstrate the ability to perform validations in accordance with standard operating procedures and requirements designated by CBP.
?	Agree to perform validation in accordance with such standard operating procedures and requirements (and adhere to any updates to such procedures and requirements as well).
?	Employ a data collection methodology to address and record a company?s compliance with CBP Importer Minimum Security Criteria and be capable of transmitting those findings to CBP in an electronic form.
?	Provide CBP with documented training procedures for the validators.
?	Agree to maintain liability insurance coverage sufficient to satisfy third party claims arising out of an incident arising from their duties as a third party validator.
?	Apply for protections under the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 or the ?SAFETY Act?, as outlined in Section 864 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. (Office of SAFETY Act Implementation (866) 788-9318 www.safetyact.gov); however, the award SAFETY Act protections will not be a factor in an entity?s selection as a validator.  Nor will an entity?s selection as a validator by CBP confer SAFETY Act protections upon that applicant.   
?	The third party firm must agree to a background investigation and/or criminal records check to be performed by CBP/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the firm?s principle management and all validators that will be used by the firm.  
?	Provide fee schedules that will be posted on the CBP Web site and have the fees openly available on the company?s Web site.  
?	Agree to sign an agreement to protect all proprietary information of C-TPAT participants with respect to which the entity will conduct validations.

Additional Requirements
Per the SAFE Port Act, the decision to validate a C-TPAT partner will remain solely within the discretion of CBP.  CBP will determine the facilities to be visited, to include the point of stuffing, drayage of the container to the port of export, and the port of export.  Upon completion of the validation, CBP will retain all decisions over the status of the C-TPAT partner.  The third party company must exclude themselves and cannot:

?	Have any beneficial interest in, or any direct or indirect control over the C-TPAT participant for which the validation services are performed. 

?	Have any other issues that can be perceived as conflict of interest with respect to the C-TPAT participant.  

?	Enter into any future supply chain security services contract with the C-TPAT participant for 12-months following the completion of the validation.  

CBP will:

?	Only grant a C-TPAT validation by a third party entity if the C-TPAT participant voluntarily submits to validation by such third party entity.

?	Ensure that the C-TPAT participant has entered into a contract with the third party entity, under which the C-TPAT participant agrees to pay all costs associated with the validation.  

CBP may allow the third party entity to attend the validation meetings with the importer ?in-country? and/or in the United States, so that the recommendations produced from the 3rd Party Validation can be reviewed and discussed with the importer.

Monitoring
On a regular basis, CBP will monitor and review the operations of a third party entity conducting validations to ensure that the entity is meeting the requirements of standard operating procedures and all other requirements listed in this document. If CBP determines that a third party entity is not meeting the minimum standard operating procedures and requirements, CBP shall:
?	Review any validations conducted by the entity.
?	Revoke the entity?s certificate of conformance.

Performance Measurements and Evaluations
Those third party firm(s) selected will be subject to periodic performance measurements and evaluations as follows:

(1)	The finding and accuracy of the third party validation and subsequent findings will be evaluated and reviewed against he standard operating procedures and other requirements designated by CBP.
(2)	The findings and assessment of the third party entity will be reviewed to determine whether all C-TPAT minimum-security criteria have been addressed. 
(3)	The third party entity will be subject to random ?spot checks? of the C-TPAT participant?s security profile to ensure proper documentation of implemented security policies and procedures.  Additionally, the domestic corporate headquarters site of the C-TPAT participant may be visited to verify security policies and procedures documented by the third party entity.

Selection of Third Party Firm(s)
CBP will identify 3-4 third party firms who best meet the requirements identified by CBP for participation in this pilot program.

Submitting Application and Related Documents 
All application materials and questions must be sent, via email, to the cbp.contractor@dhs.gov no later than April 30, 2007.  

Selection Process 
CBP?s Office of Cargo and Conveyance Security will evaluate the submitted applications based on technical ability to accomplish the stated objectives of the pilot program. CBP will exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the qualifications based on submitted applications. 

Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a ?qualified bidders list? from which the third party entity (s) are selected. 

Report CBP 
CBP will submit a report to the appropriate congressional and advisory committees no later that 30 days after the completion of the pilot program. This report will contain the following:

(1)	Results of the pilot program, including the extent to which the pilot program ensured sufficient protection of proprietary commercial information.
(2)	Cost and efficiency associated with validations under the pilot program.
(3)	Impact of the pilot program on the rate of validations conducted under C-TPAT.
(4)	Impact on national security of the pilot program
(5)	Recommendations by CBP based upon the results of the pilot program.

           Request for Information DOL079RI20344


The United States Department of Labor (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement for services to provide approximately 100 OSHA area offices information on construction projects in their jurisdiction.  The same vendor will also be required to conduct research into construction safety issues.

In accomplishing its mission under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) to assure safe and healthful workplaces, the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) carries out safety and health inspections at construction worksites in various areas throughout the country.

a.	To have complete and accurate data on the nature, identity, and location of construction worksites.  Construction worksites tend to be very mobile and exist for highly variable periods of time.

b.	To ensure that the information used to plan construction inspections be comprehensive and objective, so that a neutral selection of worksites may be made in accordance with the OSH Act.

c.	To ensure that the process used to select construction worksites for inspection is timely and makes the most efficient use of resources.

The purpose of this initiative is to assure the achievement of a. through c., and therefore the effective accomplishment of OSHA’s mission to assure a safe and healthful workplace.

OSHA is seeking information from industry regarding this requirement.  This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested qualified vendors who can provide required support.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the procurement of a set of Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA)  mirrors and anamorphic elliptical mirror.  To perform tests on the advanced space telescope, an optical test-bed is required to be designed and built at Ames Research Center by the end of 2008.  This requires a set of PIAA mirrors to be built by November of 2007 for installation into the test bed.  This requirement is essential to perform laboratory test of the latest TOPS, Telescope to Observe Planetary Systems technology advancements to bring the TOPS technology to TRL6 by October 2009. I.  PIAA2 Test Mirror Specification 1.   Background  Continuing our ongoing lab demonstration of the PIAA coronagraph, we are planning a series of laboratory verifications which will raise the PIAA planet finding approach to TRL-6 by October 2008.	This will require fabrication of a high quality PIAA mirror pair and a 1-m aperture adaptive spherical mirror.  These subsystems will be tested individually and together in both laboratory and vacuum environments.  This document specifies the performance of each of these for fabrication purposes and the combined set-up for test purposes.  The configuration consists of the following mirrors:  one Anamorphic Elliptical Mirror (AEM), one Adaptive Spherical Mirror (ASM), one spherical field mirror, one PIAA M1 mirror (M1), one PIAA M2 mirror (P2), four off-axis parabolic mirrors, and two spherical camera mirrors.  In addition the set-up includes one deformable mirror, one (or more) apodizer, and one (or more field masks).  All, but the ASM, are mounted on an optical sub-bench.  This sub-bench is metered to the ASM for stable co-alignment. 2.  Specifications  2.1 Overall description The layout of the test is  A “point” source, diverging at F/10, illuminates the Double-passed Anamorphic Ellipse which images the source at F/4 near the center of curvature of the 1-meter Adaptive Sphere.  The beam illuminates this Sphere and is reimaged by this Sphere near its center of curvature at F/4 and then in-turn by the Double-passed Anamorphic Ellipse which re-converts the beam to F/10 and reimages adjacent to the original source.  A Field Mirror near this image conjugates the Adaptive Spherical mirror with the PIAA M1.  The beam then illuminates the PIAA M1 and PIAA M2 mirrors and is apodized by them.  [The aperture stop is at the PIAA M2 mirror.]  The outgoing beam F/10 is collimated and reimaged by a series of four parabolic mirrors that form a pupil image at the Deformable Mirror and another pupil image at the Apodizer and a field image a the field mask.  The field is then reimaged onto the detector by two-crossed spherical mirrors in series. The overall constraints are summarized as follows: Constraints: PIAA M1 conjugate to Sphere. PIAA M2 is "stop" and is conjugate to DM and apodizer. Size of components: 	Source ~ 5.1 mm separated from return. Adaptive Spherical Mirror: 1 meter diameter (Clear aperture), R=4 m 	PIAA M1: ~ 90 mm diameter (Clear aperture), f=900 mm 	PIAA M2: ~ 90 mm diameter (Clear aperture), f=900 mm 	DM: ~ 9 mm diameter beam F numbers through system: 	F/10 at source 	F/4 to Sphere 	F/10 to PIAA M1 	Collimated to PIAA M2 from PIAA M1 	F/10 from PIAA M2 	F/30 to Field Mask 	F/30 to Detector Order of optics: 	Source (Field) at F/10 	First pass of Double-pass Anamorphic Ellipse converts F/10 to F/4 	Adaptive Spherical Mirror 	Second pass of Double-pass Anamorphic Ellipse converts F/4 to F/10 	Field Mirror: [Makes Sphere conjugate with PIAA M1] 	PIAA M1 	PIAA M2 	Relay PIAA M2 image to DM 	Relay PIAA M2 image to Apodizer 	Form image of Field at Field mask 2.2  Mirror Requirements The test uses front surface mirrors.  The surface of all surfaces, except the front mirror surface, shall be “fine grind” or commercial polished.  2.2.1 Mirror parameters The geometry and parameters of the mirrors with the exception of the “PIAA correction” to be applied to the PIAA M1 and PIAA M2 mirrors will be provided at time of award. 2.2.1	Base surface of PIAA M1 and PIAA M2  The test uses two PIAA mirrors whose front surfaces are each an off-axis segment of a paraboloid of revolution.  These base surfaces are modified by individual surface deviations as specified herein. The shape of the mirrors within the clear aper¬ture will be provided at time of award.  These shapes shall be extended 10% outside the clear aperture to avoid edge effects.  The base surface of the mirrors will be described at time of award. 2.2.2	First corrector mirror, PIAA M1  We describe here the aspheric deviation of PIAA M1 surface from the base surface.  The approximate functional dependence of surface sag versus position on the surface will be precisely defined in a format agree¬able with the vendor.  The sharp bend in the outer part of mirror M1 is critical to the success of the experiment, and the specifications have to be followed up the edge of the mirror.	The maximum depar¬ture from a sphere in PIAA M1 is approximately will be determined at a future date.  The approximate radius of curvature of the bend at the edge of the mirror will be determined at a future date.    2.2.3	Second corrector mirror, PIAA M2  We describe here the aspheric deviation of PIAA M2 surface from the base surface.  The approximate functional dependence of surface sag versus position on the surface will be precisely defined in a format agreeable with the vendor.  The allowed wavefront error compared to a theoretically perfect PIAA M2 for the stand-alone PIAA M2 mirror will be described at time of award. 2.3 Dual PIAA mirror set-up The PIAA M1 and PIAA M2 mirrors together are as follows:  PIAA M1 “collimates” apodizing the incident diverging F/10 beam and directing it to PIAA M2.  PIAA M2 reimages the beam as a spherical wavefront.   As defined in the overall specifications, the matched pair of PIAA mirrors, when aligned relative to each other, shall satisfy the stated wavefront error, while each mirror satisfies the stated component wavefront specification, respectively.

<DESC>Purpose NASA/HQ procurement is issuing a Request for Information (RFI), in support of NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, to obtain industry responses on NASA's proposed Commercial Aviation Transportation Services (CATS) requirement.   This RFI is for planning purposes only.  NASA will use the responses to determine whether to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure services from the private sector for all or a portion of the requirement described in the attached draft statement of work.  NASA currently meets its transportation requirements with three Government aircraft, one each at Johnson Space Center (JSC), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).	NASA intends to evaluate the price and mission effectiveness of commercial transportation services in lieu of operating NASA’s own aircraft at any or all three NASA Centers identified.	 A detailed description of the consolidated requirement for all three centers is provided in the attached draft statement of work.  A brief description of the requirement is provided below.  It should be noted that, if the Agency determines that it is more advantageous, based on cost or mission objectives, to obtain commercial aviation transportation services for only one or two centers, a new description of this more limited requirement would be prepared, and the attached draft statement of work will be modified accordingly. If an RFP is issued, it is contemplated to be released in spring 2007, with award projected for FY08, for a one year base period and four option years. The contemplated contract would be awarded as an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, fixed price contract.  The guaranteed contract minimum will be 25 occupied flight hours, per year.  The maximum will be 300 occupied flight hours per year; however, any unused flight hours will roll over to the next contract year for a potential of 1,500 occupied flight hours over the life of the contract.	Responses to the RFI may be used by the Agency as a basis for establishing the dollar ceiling amount that will be reflected in a potential RFP.  It is not anticipated at this time that NASA will accept proposals that exceed the established dollar ceiling where Government ownership of the aircraft is more cost effective. A single award will be made under the contemplated contract.  The award will be made for one, two or all three center’s flight time.  For purposes of responding to the RFI, respondents must demonstrate the capability of simultaneously providing aircraft to all three centers, as part of the Space Operations Mission Directorate requirement. Description of Requirement a. General  These non-routine aviation services will primarily originate from Johnson Space Center (JSC), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), but may originate at any of NASA’s field centers.  NASA’s transportation requirements are concentrated primarily around Space Shuttle flights, although they may occur at other times due to other contingencies, such as in-space or natural emergencies.  By way of example, transportation is required for Space Shuttle crew families to and from launches and landings, and in the event of a mishap. Additionally, flights may be needed to carry an Initial Response Team to a launch-abort site identified as East Coast Abort Landing Site (ECALS) or to an OCONUS landing site identified as a Transoceanic Abort Landing Site (TALS). The Shuttle is scheduled for four to six missions a year. CATS would typically be needed during Shuttle launch windows, which are subject to change. Transportation services will also be provided in support of the International Space Station Program; for emergency response to in-space operations problems; and, approximately twice a year NASA requires transportation for astronaut crews to and from Kazakhstan.  In addition, the contractor would be obligated to move delicate mission-related equipment the size of passenger baggage dimensions. The Contractor shall provide ready to fly aircraft within 4 hours of the initial notification. To meet the shuttle and station emergency transportation flight requirements, multiple aircraft, with a capacity of up to twelve passengers, may simultaneously be required at JSC, KSC, and MSFC.  NASA requires approximately 300 occupied flight hours per year. The Contractor shall have aircraft with the capability of carrying at least 7 passengers and on occasion 12 passengers.  The respondent should indicate in the discussion how it is able to meet this commitment by focusing on the number of aircraft in its fleet, available supplemental lift, previous experience and any other information the respondent considers to be relevant to a demonstration of their ability to meet NASA’s requirement. Respondents must indicate in their response if they are Wyvern and or Argus Platinum certified, approved by the Department of Defense Commercial Air Transportation Quality and Safety Review Program; or have an equivalent certification.    b. Standardized Fuel Approach All respondents should assume a fuel cost of $3.50 per gallon of Jet-A in their response to this RFI.  This will be the base price and will allow direct comparison with the current means of providing the service. The government will not provide fuel for this operation.  Responses to the RFI NASA is soliciting all comments from industry regarding this RFI and will consider the information received to better understand industry capabilities and to determine the acquisition strategy and approach, as well as the most appropriate way to proceed.  This RFI will also allow potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy NASA’s requirement.    NASA is also requesting interested parties to complete the attached Price chart providing an estimated price per flight hour.   Industry may also indicate on the attached price chart whether a price break is offered for award to more than one center.  For the reasons stated above, receipt of this pricing information is one of the primary reasons behind the issuance of this RFI. In addition to the feedback and estimated prices, please submit a capability statement that adequately describes your company's ability, resources and approach to fulfilling this requirement.  NASA will be obtaining contractor support in the evaluation of the responses received under this RFI.  Companies are responsible for marking data deemed restricted in their submissions as “proprietary”.    All responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Rachel McIntyre no later than close of business April 18, 2007.  When responding to this RFI, reference NNH07184998-2L. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Research, Development and Engineering Command Acquisition Center, Edgewood Contracting Division, is seeking all sources interested in participating in a full and open competition for the Full Rate Production (FRP) of the Joint Biologic al Point Detection System (JBPDS), associated platforms, engineering support and services, and fielding efforts. An FRP decision is scheduled for June 2008. The FRP contract will produce a maximum of 800 total systems spread among the four (4) configuratio ns of the JBPDS: XM97 Shelter, XM98 Ship, XM96 Man portable, and XM103 Trailer (including trailer platform). Requirements for repair parts, engineering services (including technology upgrades), logistical products (including manuals and training materials) , and field support such as New Equipment Training (NET), all associated with the JBPDS, will also be included. An overview of the FRP strategy will be presented at the upcoming Advanced Planning Briefing for Industry on April 4-5, at the Washington Conven tion Center, Washington D.C. The draft statement of work and performance specification are expected to be posted on or about 1 April 2007. A pre-solicitation conference is being considered to address industry questions on the draft documents, occurring in late April or early May. Based upon the information presented by the Government, interested parties should demonstrate their interest by responding to the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center no later than 30 April 2007. A pre-solicitation conference will o nly be held if at least one respondent (other than the incumbent) replies by the 30 April 2007 deadline. If the only response received is from the incumbent contractor, the Government may conclude that adequate competition for this procurement action is no t a reasonable expectation (based upon this response and past history of previous contracts) and may proceed to award the effort on a sole source basis to the incumbent. If the pre-solicitation conference is held, the draft documents will be updated based upon analysis of comments received and a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) issued. A two-phased RFP is planned. Phase One will require interested parties to demonstrate the capabilities necessary to perform the effort by providing company qualifications in  the area of biological detection equipment and fabrication experience. Any company determined to be qualified will be provided with a current JPBDS in order to assist in completing proposal preparation and submission. If the incumbent contractor is the on ly qualified respondent to the Phase One portion of the RFP, the Government may conclude that adequate competition for this procurement action does not exist, and may therefore proceed to award the effort on a sole source basis to the incumbent. If one or more qualified non-incumbents respond, Phase Two will require a complete cost and technical proposal, due in late Spring 2008.

<RESPDATE>041707
<ARCHDATE>09302007
<CONTACT>Charlene Jeong, 937-255-4955
<DESC>Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System This is a request for information, issued for the purpose of identifying  potential sources with the capability to accomplish the effort described  herein. The 677 AESG will be competing the Joint Terminal Control Training  and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) with deliveries beginning in fiscal year  (FY) 2009. We are formulating our acquisition strategy and will establish  a new PIXS (https://pixs.wpafb.af.mil/) site shortly which will be our  primary interface with industry. We anticipate releasing the Draft Request  for Proposal (DRFP) for industry comment in late summer and a final RFP in  the fall of 2007. We expect contract award next spring. If you have any  questions or comments, please use the points of contact at the email  addresses listed below. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the  Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible  for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government  does not presently intend to award a contract, but is in need of  information on potential sources for a system in support of Joint Tactical  Close Air Support to train Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC),  Forward Observers, and Combat Controllers for the Combat Air Forces (CAF)  and SOCOM. The potential exists for the contract to also provide systems  to support Naval Gunfire Observers and Fire Support Planning, and Forward  Observers for the US Army. JTC TRS is an OSD derived program designed to fulfill an immediate need  for realistic training and mission rehearsal for Joint Terminal Attack  Control (JTAC), Joint Fires Support, and Air Traffic Control (ATC).  The  anticipated system(s) will be used to train basic procedures in the  schoolhouse environment as well as mission rehearsal in large scale  exercises. Mission rehearsal capabilities to practice, validate, and  verify Joint Doctrine Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (JTTP) are  essential.  This training capability provides direct support to Global War  on Terror and Combat Operations. Both manual real time control and  automated simulation of airborne assets is required. Multiple  configurations of the basic training system are anticipated which include  a fixed version and a portable version suitable for forward deployment  and/or ship board operations. The fixed will be configurable to suit  student groups in a school house environment, team training and individual  mission rehearsal.  Instructor Operator Stations; robust simulated threat  environment; simulated natural environment; and Brief/Debrief Systems are  all required subsystems.  The attached draft Performance Specification has  been provided to offer industry additional insight to the requirements.  This document is a work in progress.  The government would welcome  comments to this document, though they are not required in order to  respond to this RFI.  The military services are investing heavily in high  fidelity, globally networked, combat mission simulations to provide  training in virtual environments that approach live operations. All  services are stressing interoperability as a basic requirement. By the  time JTC TRS is expected to be fielded, many air-to-ground platforms will  have simulators that are fully network interoperable. This requirement  drives visual simulation requirements; geographically accurate visual  databases; high fidelity representations of weapons systems that interact  with JTACs; and high fidelity simulation of weapons effects. Each JTAC  site will connect into the Distributed Mission Operations Network (DMON)  as well as other service and joint networks. This will require the JTC TRS  to comply with CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at  http://www.dmodmt.com/) and follow the guidelines of CJCSI 6212.01C. An  associate contract agreement with the DMON network provider and other  simulator manufacturers will be required in support of distributed mission  integration. Detailed performance requirements can be found in the  attached draft government performance specification.  Several examples of  JTAC trainers have been, or are being developed for research including a  proof of concept device, all of which will be made available for industry  review at the appropriate time.  The CAF has a requirement for at least 36  systems to be delivered beginning in FY09 in the continental US, USAFE and  PACAF of which approximately one-third are currently funded. SOCOM  currently has a requirement for 16 systems. Full funding does not yet  exist for all requirements. Other service requirements have not been  finalized. The Government anticipates a contractor logistics support (CLS)  concept for the CAF. Support concepts for the other services have not been  determined. All systems will be housed in Government facilities.  Government-contracted instructor/operators will support assets acquired  for SOCOM/AFSOC under a separate contract. In response to this RFI, please provide the following information: 1. A description of your company and its experience in developing and  deploying high fidelity training devices and simulations for combat  training. 2. A description of your capability to field a trainer that meets the  basic requirements described in the attached draft government performance  specification. 3. A description of your company’s capabilities and experiences in the  worldwide deployment and support of complex training systems. Assuming a  contract award in the 2nd quarter of CY08, how soon could your company  deliver an operational trainer to a CONUS SOCOM location, and how many  systems per year can your company deploy of each type? 4. A description of your experience in networking simulators, and in  working with interoperability mechanisms such as DIS and HLA. 5. Identify the top five risks you foresee in executing an acquisition of  this scope. 6. Comments to the attached draft government performance specification.  The government is especially interested in the technology challenges each  offeror sees in the draft performance description. 7. Any other relevant topics, concerns, and information that will help the  Government in forming an acquisition strategy. 8. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)  code is expected to be 541512, with a size standard of $23M. Indicate  whether you are a large or small business in relation to NAICS 541512 and  if small, your small business type (Small, SDB, etc.) Technical questions may be directed to Rick Jones, acting Program Manager  at 937-255-3780, email: rick.jones@wpafb.af.mil.  Contractual questions  may be directed to Charlene Jeong, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-4955,  email: charlene.jeong@wpafb.af.mil. Formal responses should be e-mailed  (preferred), faxed or mailed to: 677 AESG/TO (Attn: Charlene Jeong) 2300 D  Street, Bldg 32 Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7249 e-mail:  charlene.jeong@wpafb.af.mil FAX: (937) 656-7538. Responses are requested NO LATER THAN 17 April 2007. Given the need for a  rapid response to this RFI, lengthy and elaborate presentation material  and explanations are discouraged. Marketing materials are not a sufficient  response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 15 pages,  excluding comments to the draft government performance specification. A  point of contact that can speak for the responding company should be  identified to support further Government inquiries as well as explanations  that might be needed with regard to the information provided. Responses to  the RFI will not be returned. Respondents should indicate which portions  of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.

<DESC>Request for Information OSHA-03-28


The United States Department of Labor (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement for services to provide approximately 100 OSHA area offices information on construction projects in their jurisdiction.  The same vendor will also be required to conduct research into construction safety issues.

In accomplishing its mission under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) to assure safe and healthful workplaces, the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) carries out safety and health inspections at construction worksites in various areas throughout the country.

a.	To have complete and accurate data on the nature, identity, and location of construction worksites.  Construction worksites tend to be very mobile and exist for highly variable periods of time.

b.	To ensure that the information used to plan construction inspections be comprehensive and objective, so that a neutral selection of worksites may be made in accordance with the OSH Act.

c.	To ensure that the process used to select construction worksites for inspection is timely and makes the most efficient use of resources.

The purpose of this initiative is to assure the achievement of a. through c., and therefore the effective accomplishment of OSHA’s mission to assure a safe and healthful workplace.

OSHA is seeking information from industry regarding this requirement.  This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested qualified vendors who can provide required support.

6)  Demonstrate past experience utilizing Dodge Construction Potentials (DCP) data from F.W. Dodge to provide monthly lists about current construction projects. The lists will contain which job sites each OSHA area office will inspect based on criteria provided to contractor.  RFI respondents shall describe their experience with:

•	Accurate extraction of information  from data using provided criteria;
•	Timely delivery of information in an electronic format so that the receiving entity will not have to resort to manual reentry.
.  
Clearly state name of the agency or business, point of contact, contract number, contract date, and contract size (both dollar value and number of full-time people involved in contract work)


7) Demonstrate past experience with construction safety research done in a timely manner.  Research and analysis must be conducted by experts in the fields of Construction, Engineering and Safety.

Description: The NSN for the MJU-51A/B Decoy is 1370-01-468-6077.  The MJU-51A/B infrared countermeasure decoy is an aluminum cartridge case purged with nitrogen and containing a payload of stacked special material elements that react with air.  Each aluminum cartridge case contains a sealed receptacle cup with an O-ring for an impulse cartridge, a plastic/nylon piston, crimped and then sealed, with a metal end plate.  When the impulse cartridge is initiated by the firing pulse, the impulse cartridge receptacle cup frangible membrane ruptures.  Pressure inside the canister increases pushing on the piston and breaking the end cap seal deploying the special material payload in the air stream.  The special material payload reacts with the air generating infrared energy to decoy surface to air and air to air missiles.

A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of  Crutches, Canes, and Accessories.  The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for Crutches, Canes, and Accessories that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
 
     This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.    
   
Point of Contact Robert Meinertzhagen, 757-953-2134, Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Mid-Atlantic Region is seeking product line items in the category of Crutches, Canes, and Accessories.  

The approximate annual purchase volume of $153,195 is based upon the historical usage of standardized Crutches, Canes, and Accessories over a one year period.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the Best Value and trade off criteria.  The Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region is Owens & Minor.  

At the request of the Mid-Atlantic Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., fourteen (14) calendar days from the closing of this FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from future participation in this standardization effort.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.
Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Those companies who do meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  
For those companies that meet the criteria above and below under Technical/Company Criteria, the TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., three (3) weeks after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.
1.	The MTFs will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement using a zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to not acceptable and seven is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  Summary ratings for each vendor will be an average of their numerical scorings combined with an adjectival scale of highly acceptable, acceptable, minimally acceptable, and not acceptable.  All clinical criteria are weighted equally. The scale descriptors are: 0 = not acceptable and 7 = highly acceptable.  Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 
      
2.	 After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. two (2) weeks from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). 

Technical/Company Criteria:


The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the vendor, who will be named the quoter, offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoter’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; 3) the quoter has or is obtaining a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; 4) the quoter has or is obtaining an agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region. 

1.	Does your company manufacture a full line of canes, crutches & accessories for adults and pediatrics?
2.	Are your products available through the Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor?
3.	What is your DAPA Number?
4.	Under what brand(s) does your company manufacture or distribute your product?
5.	Under what standards is your product manufactured?
6.	What types of educational tools or materials do you have for this product line?
7.	What kind of staff training does your company provide?
8.	Does your company provide customer service 24/7? 
9.	Is there any history of backorders and/or recalls for this product group?  If yes, please answer:  (a) Dates and duration, (b) Cause, and (c) Resolution
10.	Is you company willing to offer pricing discounts from your DAPA pricing in return for a volume product purchase commitment by regional participating commands?

Clinical/Performance Criteria:
1.	Crutches, Canes, and Accessories adequately adjust in a simple and positive manner
2.	The  Crutches, Canes and Accessories product line contains the clinical variety required   to meet  the needs of both  adults and children 
3.	The design of the padding and grips will deliver a satisfactory level of patient comfort

<SUBJECT>66 -- Controller Upgrades, a Software Package and Wedge Grip Inserts for Fatigue Testing Machines
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the Materials Reliability Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to negotiate with MTS Systems Corporation, located at 14000 Technology Drive, Eden Prairie, MN  55344-2247 for three controller upgrades, a software package and wedge grip inserts.   

BACKGROUND:  Items are needed to continue mechanical properties research on pipeline steel materials in support of the National Pipeline Safety Act and the Department of Transportation/Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (DOT/PHMSA).  NIST is in need of the new controllers because the existing MTS controllers are approximately 25 years old; they are obsolete and no longer repairable.  The new controllers will update the test machines to current state-of-the-art.  The software package is needed so that NIST can monitor crack-mouth-opening displacement on both sides of a test specimen using NIST's current fatigue-crack-growth-rate software package.  The wedge grip inserts are needed so that NIST can test various thickness test specimens in the existing 220 kip hydraulic grips.   

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a 90 day performance period. 

SOLE SOURCE: NIST has determined that MTS Systems Corporation is the only contractor that can satisfy its requirements.  NIST currently has nine MTS fatigue machines that total approximately $2.5M in value. These machines are set up so that controllers and other related equipment can be easily interchanged between the machines and hydraulic power supplies if necessary. This interchangeability feature saves the Government substantial dollars because of its compatibility. A different type controller would not be interchangeable with the existing systems and would require a substantial outlay in Government dollars to make the other systems compatible to a different controller.   The needed MTS controllers are unique in that they have particular required features that are not found in other test machine controllers as follows: 1) Control loop rate must be 6 kHz for high speed test control with the three-stage valve, 2) data acquisition rate of at least 49 kHz is required to capture high speed events, 3) data acquisition must be at least 16 bit resolution, simultaneous sample and hold on all channels, simultaneously, 4) Controller must be capable of defining and running block-cycle tests with and without computer supervision, 5) Controller must be able to support sine-sweep function generation, with and without computer supervision. Controller must also be capable of user-selectable lower frequency, amplitude, linear or log sweep and continuous or single sweep, 6) Controller must have user interface with display and keypad  to support stand-alone operation and  7)  A software program must be provided that includes PC data acquisition (timed, peak/valley, level crossing, max/min and cyclic/logarithmic), function generation on all channels, (Sine, square, triangle, ramp, hold processes) and the ability to play digitized profiles. It must also provide for limit sensing, sequencing triggers and interface to 32 digital I/O channels.  In addition, the required software package is proprietary software and is sold only by MTS. It interfaces with another proprietary software package sold by MTS.  Finally, the wedge grip inserts are for an existing MTS hydraulic wedge grip system. MTS Systems Corporation is the only one responsible source for two controller upgrades, a software package and wedge grip inserts described above.  

This is not a formal solicitation. This notice may represent the only notice. See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- Revised GOES-R Acquisition Strategy
<DESC>On November 29, 2004 NOAA posted a presolicitation notice (reference number: NE-EK000-5-00033) which identified a phased, single prime contractor acquisition approach for the procurement of an end-to-end fully integrated contract for space and ground systems for the GOES-R satellite.  Since that time NOAA has awarded system Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) contracts in support of the Acquisition and Operations phase.  The Program has revised its program management and acquisition strategies to strengthen government oversight and control and to leverage the unique capabilities of NOAA and NASA.  NOAA believes the revised acquisition strategy and management approach reduces program risk and maximizes NOAA’s potential for fielding a high performing satellite system on schedule and within budget.  

The revised acquisition strategy replaces the single prime contract approach with multiple contracts.  NOAA will retain overall program management responsibility.  NOAA will acquire the ground system, operate the system following satellite launch, and will be responsible for algorithm development.  NASA will award the spacecraft contract.  NASA will also continue to award the instrument contracts and will provide the instruments to the spacecraft contractor as Government Furnished Equipment.  NASA will acquire the launch vehicle under a separate contract.  NASA will manage systems engineering and integration.  

The GOES-R Program intends to release requests for proposals (RFP) for both space and ground segments by the Fall of 2007, and award the contracts by the Summer of 2008. 

This announcement is for information purposes only; it is not a solicitation, nor is it a request for a capabilities statement from vendors.  Any proposal documents, capabilities statements and marketing information submitted by vendors will be used for market research purposes only.  Additional details regarding these acquisitions will be provided subsequently.

<SUBJECT>--Soy Adhesives Scale-Up: Reproducibility and Processing Conditions
<DESC>The US Army Natick Soldier Center (NSC) intends to award a  Sole Source contract to Kansas State University (KSU) of Manhattan, KS, for research and development associated with production of soy adhesives for military packaging.  This research effort  is a modification to an existing contract that will focus on the reproducibility, processing conditions, and quality of soy adhesives under a variety of parameters, including pH, temperature, stirring speed, reaction time, composition, and other factors.  The rationale for other than full and open competition is that this research is a logical follow-on to previous efforts performed by KSU that can best achieve successful results by continued utilization of the KSU technical resources.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all comments received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please refer to numbered note 25.  The Purchase Request number for this acquisition is W91A2K-7079-9010.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611310.

<SUBJECT>--Radio Frequency (RF) Distribution Over Fiber Request for Information (RFI)
<DESC>NOTE:  This Request for information was also to the IBOP, March 27, 2007.  The link for the IBOP is http://abop.monmouth.army.mil/.  It is strongly recommended to view the RFI on the IBOP easier reading. Updates, if any, to this RFI will be posted to  the IBOP only.  Radio Frequency (RF) Distribution Over Fiber Request for Information (RFI) March 23, 2007 INTRODUCTION: The US Army is requesting information to support a study of an optical based Radio Frequency Distribution (RFD) system to be used in an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft.  The goal is to reduce SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) by p erforming RF functions in the optical domain. This can be accomplished by replacing standard coaxial or waveguide cabling with fiber optic cables, switching with photonic based switching technology, and processing through the use of phase shifting and ampl itude control, filtering, and wavelength division multiplexing for routing of signals.  Because SWaP bounds the capabilities that can be carried on an airborne system, the Army and the other services are very interested in any efforts to reduce SWaP in ord er to increase ISR capability.   The Army will be assessing photonic technology in order to quantify performance, SWaP, technological maturity, risk, and Total Ownership Cost (TOC).  The intent is to determine when this technology could be integrated onto an ISR platform, the benefits fro m such an implementation, and risks.  This RFI is for the purpose of obtaining information only.  The information will be used to assess the depth and range of contract firms with the requisite skills and performance to meet the requirements.  No contract award or funding of any kind will occur as a result of this market survey.  The lack of the submission of data at this time will not eliminate any firms participation in the future competition.   Any submission to this RFI should address these specific TOC aspects; logistical support (reliability, sustainability, and maintainability) and Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I). SCOPE:  The study of the optical based RFD will be completed in two phases.   Phase I: Market Survey- The first phase will survey photonics technologies and fielded implementations.  This will include an evaluation of innovative photonic technologies that improve performance and reduce SWAP in the entire RF system.  However, the foc us will be on RFD components and systems. Phase II: Technology Demonstration- The second phase, if executed, will involve a demonstration of a scaled RFD to validate performance that consists of at least three functional elements, e.g. conversion, distribution, and switching.  The validation will be by both a lab demonstration and a flight test on a test bed aircraft.  The flight test validation is to serve two purposes, validate technology readiness level (TRL) and provide a comparison between a conventional RFD and one in the optical domain.  NOT E: The Definitions of Technology Readiness Levels in the Department of Defense (DOD) can be found at the end of this document. The RFD for the ISR platform connects a large number of antennas distributed over an aircraft to several processing nodes within the aircraft. The RFD covers a wide frequency range from HF to millimeter wave frequencies.  The frequency bands may be divided  into sub-bands to meet performance objectives for dynamic range.  The sub-bands and apertures must be individually switched to the individual processing nodes. Each processing node must have non-blocking access to any allowable antenna/sub-band simultaneo usly.  In addition, a single antenna/sub-band can be connected to multiple allowable processing nodes simultaneously.   Requirements: The following subset of system capabilities and requirements will be used to demonstrate the proposers ability to meet the overall system requirements. 1. RFD: Referring to the table, a hypothetical spectrum of interes t is divided into four frequency bands that are further broken down to accommodate requirements changes in-band.  Within each band, the proposed RFD solution is required to switch and distribute 5 RF feeds (5 inputs and 5 output ports) simultaneously, incl uding a single feed serving multiple subsystems.  Where the RFD system requires subdivision of the bands into sub-bands to meet performance requirements, the performance effects of filters should be included, and switching capabilities should be scaled to ensure that all sub-bands have connection to all processing sub-systems.  The minimum input power is assumed to be -95 dBm and each of the output should experience no losses (gain of 10-20 dB is desirable).  Submissions should include any gain and noise fi gures where applicable. Band		Frequency Band (MHz)	Processing Nodes		1 MHz Bandwidth	 					    (Switching)	Dynamic Range (dB)	SFDR (dB) HF			3-30			5		108		81 VHF /UHF		30-500			5		110		81 			500-3000				110		80 UHF/ SHF		500-3000		5		110		80 			3000-10000				104		76 SHF / EHF 		500-3000		5		110		80 			3000-10000				104		76 			10000-20000				101		74 			20000-30000				94		70 It is expected that the architecture will generally follow these guidelines: "	System should be designed to facilitate maintenance and allow for upgrading.  As such, equipment located in a centralized location is favored over distributed equipment.  Any necessary equipment located at the antennas should be designed to maximize the ease of maintenance and upgrading.  "	Responders may show a partial solution/sub unit of the RFD system such as a single frequency band RFD, a RF-photonic link, an optical switching net-work, etc., however, the information should indicate what other parts (preferably COTS components) are nee ded in order to complete the whole RFD. "	Innovative solutions to improve performance/SWAP should include: o	For the RF-photonic link, include enough detail such as methods of RF-to-optical conversion and detection (intensity modulation or phase modulation/coherent detection; external modulation or direct modulation); laser, modulator and detector performances to indicate what SFDR and link gain can be achieved.  o	For the switching network, include enough detail such as method of switching (i.e. WDM or electro-optic); method of splitting; and RF-Photonic link requirement for the net-work. Indicating loss, cross-talk, switching speed, etc. o	Packaging schemes to reduce size (footprint) and complexity such as multi-level modules that integrate: optical, microwave, electro-optic and antennas at millimeter wave frequencies; integration of multiple optical functions on the same chip or circuit t o reduce cost and improve reliability o	Optical cable type and connectors type o	Overall SWaP estimates. 2. Other innovative photonic technologies: The following photonic technologies that improve performance and significantly reduce SWaP in the entire RF system of an airborne ISR platform if the TRL is above 3. "	Optical control of phased array antenna o	Beam-forming/steering o	Optical true-time-delay generator "	RF-Optical signal processing o	Filtering o	Channelizing "	RF-Photonic radar receiver Environmental: Environmental requirements are as called out in RTCA DO-160.  Aircraft is expected to fly at up to 40,000 ft. RFI Format Paper should not exceed 10 pages, with Font Size 11, in PDF format; Excel format for SWaP (Size Weight and Power) analysis should have locked cells for protection of proprietary simulations.  For SWaP data, government should be allowed to change or update parameters on all spreadsheet data.  The papers will be categorized into system, sub-system and components.  System papers should present an overall solution of the entire RFD. Sub-systems papers should show a significant system function. Components papers  should show innovative components that can address fiber optic links, processing or switching. Government contractors should be allowe d to evaluate white paper and / or technology (NRO contract). Government and their consultants may request site visits to observe technology demonstrations. 0.

Reference: Technology Readiness Levels in the Department of Defense (DOD) (Source: DOD (2004), DODI 5000.2 Acquisition System Guidebook) Technology Readiness Level Description 1. Basic principles observed and reported Lowest level of technology readiness. Scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development. Example might include paper studies of a technology's basic properties. 2. Technology concept and/or application formulated Invention begins. Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented. The application is speculative and there is no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumption. Examples are still limited to paper studies. 3. Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept Active research and development is initiated. This includes analytical studies and laboratory studies to physically validate analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology. Examples include components that are not yet integrated or represent ative. 4. Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment Basic technological components are integrated to establish that the pieces will work together. This is relatively Alow fidelity compared to the eventual system. Examples include integration of 'ad hoc' hardware in a laboratory. 5. Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly. The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so that the technology can be tested in a simulated environment. Examples include 'high fidelity' lab oratory integration of components. 6. System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond the breadboard tested for TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment. Represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness. Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelit y laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment. 7. System prototype demonstration in an oper ational environment Prototype near or at planned operational system. Represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring the demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment, such as in an aircraft, vehicle or space. Examples include testing the prototyp e in a test bed aircraft. 8. Actual system completed and 'flight qualified' through test and demonstration Technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development. Examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications. 9. Actual system 'flight proven' through successful mission operations Actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation. In almost all cases, this is the end of the last 'bug fixing' aspects of true system development. Examples in clude using the system under operational mission conditions.

(a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistic s Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection  between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate  (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow  additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as poss ible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5in clearance) will require a time stamped se arched- label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched- labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5in in height and that they will req uire access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a -searched- label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, i ncluding drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate .  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.

Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to pe rform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requi res access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Libert y) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if th e contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identific ation card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.   If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identific ation badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under t he contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately not ify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government i nstallation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are i ssued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such l oss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.

The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for acc ess to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.
