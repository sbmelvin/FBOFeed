<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request For Quotation (RFQ) number is N66604-02-Q-1628. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17. This is 100% set-aside for small business. NAICS Code is 334513; size standard is 500 employees. NUWC Division Newport intends to purchase the following items: 0001 Sensor Tran Model 5000 Distributed Temperature Sensor System (DTS), quantity (1). Item 0002 Upgrade of model 5000 DTS system to Model 10K, quantity (1). Required delivery is: item 0001 01 May 2002; item 0002 01 September 2002. F.O.B. Destination Naval Station Newport; Newport, RI. It is expected to place a purchase order with Systems and Processes Engineering Corporation, 101 West Sixth Street, Suite 2000101, Austin, TX 78701-2932. They are the only known source for these items because it is the only manufacturer of distributed temperature sensors systems which does not consist of a closed optical loop. Closed loop systems require a relatively large fiber optic ring at the "wet" end of the cable, which would be unacceptable due project requirements. Additionally, the project currently owns two distributed temperature sensor (DTS) systems manufactured by SPEC. Purchasing this system, and subsequent systems, from the same manufacturer will allow for interchangeability and compatibility of interrogator/processor units. All other timely offers will be considered. Offers for other products must contain complete product information and prices. FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items applies. Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items. Evaluation factors are technical capability, price and past performance. Each is equally important.

FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, and DFARS 52.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items apply. The following addenda or additional terms and conditions apply: none. Offers should include price and delivery terms and the following additional information: none required. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies. Offers must be submitted to Commercial Acquisition Department, Building 11, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Code 5912, Simonpietri Drive, Newport, Rhode Island 02841-1708 or may be faxed to 401-832-4820.

<DESC>Operational Contracting plans to issue a solicitation on the Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB) (http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil) on a future date to acquire a contract for the Commercial Travel Office (CTO) for Official travel at Hanscom AFB, MA. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The North American Industries Classification System (NAICS) code will be 561510  - Travel Agencies.  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in acting as agents in selling travel, tour, and accommodation services to the general public and commercial clients.  The small business size standard is $1,000,000 annually in average gross revenue taken for the last three fiscal years.  For NAIC 561510, gross revenue excludes funds received in trust for an unaffiliated third party, such as bookings or sales subject to commissions.  The commissions themselves are included as revenue.  The solicitation and resultant contract are designed to provide interim official travel services until the establishment of the Defense Travel System  (DTS) (anticipated DTS for Hanscom is August 2003).  If DTS is implemented on or before August 2003, the CTO contract will be terminated with 60 days notification, at no penalty or termination cost to the Government.  Award will be made on or about 1 June 2002.  The period of performance for the CTO contract is for 3 Years (One Year Base Period, including a 30 day orientation period, and 2, 1-year Options).  The period of performance for the Base Year will be approximately 1 June 2002 through 31 May 2003 depending on award date.  This includes the 30 day orientation period which will run from 1 June 2002 through 30 June 2002.   The current contractor, The Travel Company, will permit the incoming contractor access to the on-site facilities during the 30-day orientation period for the purpose of learning the requirements and processes of the Hanscom travel office.  The incoming contractor will receive no compensation during this 30-day orientation period.  The prospective Contractor shall take over all travel office requirements by the completion of this orientation.   Option 1 will be from approximately 1 June 2003 through 31 May 2004 and Option 2 will be from approximately 1 June 2004 through 31 May 2005.  The prospective contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to perform the management and operation of official travel services. The prospective Contractor shall be primarily engaged in furnishing travel information and acting as agents in arranging travel in support of official government travel requirements.  These services shall include making airline travel reservations, car rental and lodging reservations, and ticketing and billing.  Hanscom AFB has an annual dollar volume of approximately $4.8 million for official travel.  This amount is based on the most recent annual breakout: Approximately 15,300 official airline travel tickets were issued consisting of 900 international tickets for approximately $800,000 and 14,400 domestic tickets totaling approximately $4.0 million, 9,300 rental cars for approximately $1.2 million and 1,000 refunds totaling approximately $313,000.  Please note the Government neither warrants nor guarantees any specific volume of travel services; actual workload may fluctuate substantially.  The successful contractor will be reimbursed under this contract by a combination of a transaction fee paid by each traveler's office and all commissions paid by the airlines, car rental businesses, the accommodation sector, and other travel organizations.  The CTO solicitation will ask prospective offerors to provide an Official Travel Transaction Fee based on the following:         1)	The Contractor shall make confirmed reservations for all modes of transportation as requested.  A non-refundable transaction fee will be charged for each reservation booked and ticketed.  A "reservation" can consist of airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations or rail reservations as well as any combination thereof.  The fee is charged only one time per transaction no matter how many components may be included. The transaction fee will be assessed only one time per transaction whether or not changes are made to the reservation.   The following are some of the travel services qualifications that will be important in selecting the successful contractor; Compliance with travel policies, (GSA mandatory programs, e.g. Contract Airline City-Pair), Customer Service, On-Site and/or Off-Site Service, Hours of Operation, Emergency Services, Billing and Payment Procedures, Services related to Making and Booking Reservations, Quality Control Procedures, and Ticketing (e-tickets and/or hard-copies).  This is a best value acquisition and will be awarded to that contractor who offers the Government the best overall value based on a combination of price, technical ability and past performance.  Contractors that are interested and capable of providing these services should respond to this notice via e-mail, with a brief resume and any other information they deem appropriate within 15 days of this publication, to the following address: Amy.Sirois@hanscom.af.mil.  No telephone inquiries to this notice will be considered.  This solicitation will be issued using commercial practices in accordance with FAR Part 12. All respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to receive an award.  Applications for CCR registration may be obtained at: www.ccr2000.com/. Acknowledgment of responses to this notice will not be issued.  However, respondents will be notified when the CTO solicitation is posted on HERBB.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after receipt of proposals, with no obligation by the Government to anyone who submitted a proposal.

Each task order will not exceed $250,000.00.  The $5,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread out over the life of the contract including all option years. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES:  The U. S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s)must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and membership in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. The National Park Service, Pacific West Region has implemented Directive PW-048 which delineates how it emphasizes the concept of sustainability with respect to design and construction practices. Implementing sustainable design and construction practices is the constant process of identifying and incorporating activities and actions during facility planning, design, construction, and operation to meet the following goals:  a.  Consume less energy and natural resources over the life of the facility; b.  Ensure that resources such as water, air and land are as clean or cleaner at the end of use as at the beginning; c.  Ensure that the viability, integrity and diversity of natural systems are protected, undiminished and maintained; d.  Ensure that natural sound-scape and dark skies are undiminished; e.  Use green technologies and products that have less negative impacts on human health and the environment; f. Reduce the material entering landfills; and g.  Ensure compliance with all natural and cultural requirements.  EXECUTIVE ORDERS:  In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement.  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, a clause holding the firm harmless will not be included in the contract. Executive Order 13101 – Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition,” (September 14, 1998).  This Executive Order requires Federal Agencies to incorporate waste prevention and recycling in the Agency’s operation and work to increase and expand markets for recovered materials through greater Federal Government preference and demand for such products.  In developing work plans, work statements and specifications, Agencies must consider the “elimination of virgin materials requirements, use of bio-based products, use of recovered materials, reuse of product, lifecycle cost and lifecycle assessment, recycle ability, use of environmental preferable products, waste prevention and ultimate disposal.”  The Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), Section 6002 and Executive Order 13101 require the purchase of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated products with a required minimum recovered material content as described in an Agency’s Affirmative Procurement Program (APP).  This list of EPA-designated products is available at http://www.epa.gov/cpg.  This requirement applies to all contracts that require EPA-designated products.  When purchasing a product or products on this list without the required minimum recovered minimum recovered material content, a written justification based on specific exemptions is required by FAR 23.405.  A/E firms and their consultants are required to be familiar with EPA guidelines by developing specifications utilizing EPA’s minimum recycled content standards.  If products specified by the A/E do not meet EPA’s guidelines, the A/E must prepare written justifications in accordance with FAR 23.405.  A/E firms are to use life-cycle cost analysis, wherever feasible and appropriate to assist selection of products and services.  Whenever possible, cost shall be calculated over the life of the item, not just the initial, up-front cost.  When comparing alternative products, the initial cost of the acquisition as well as maintenance costs, operational costs, etc., must be considered in the analysis.  A product having a higher initial cost may have lower operational costs or higher resale value and will, therefore, prove to be a better value and more cost effective compared to the alternatives. PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED:  For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily Pre-Design, Compliance, and Supplemental Services (Title I Services), Design and Construction Documents (Title II Services), and Construction Management (Title III Services).  All work and deliverables shall be stamped and sealed by Registered Professionals.  All professionals shall be registered in the States in which the work is performed.  Title I Services:    Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, the preparation of conceptual, schematic, and preliminary design documents.  This may include site and feasibility investigations; laboratory testing; pilot testing of water treatment systems; surveying; geotechnical studies; drilling of test/pilot wells; investigation and analysis of existing systems; research and analysis of pertinent Federal, State, and local regulations and codes; permitting; value analysis (engineering) and preliminary design, including alternatives analysis, schematic design and design development; preliminary drawings; and value and design analysis, including acquisition of data pertaining to local construction practices and material availability, outline specifications, and preliminary construction cost estimates; comparability cost analysis; NEPA and Section 106 Compliance; and peer review of NPS in house or other A/E designs.  Title II Services:  Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, the preparation of  design development documents, construction drawings, and construction specifications and preparation of construction cost estimates for civil/environmental engineering projects, including repair, rehabilitation and modification of existing buildings, roads with associated parking, and utility systems; and peer review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs. Final construction documents (i.e., plans and specifications) must be  furnished  to the NPS in an electronic format capable of being transmitted over the Internet to the general  public via electronic commerce.  Title III Services:  Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, construction management services, which include management from construction contract award to final acceptance of actions required to complete the proposed facility including the warranty period.  This includes construction observation, review of submittals, value engineering, site visits, field testing, preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, construction support, and consultation during construction.  Much of the work to be performed in historic buildings and sites will require continuous attention to compliance with historic preservation guidelines, techniques, and oversight.  COORDINATION:  The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants.  The A/E will need to have direct contact with federal, state or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  A:  Demonstrated professional qualifications, professional registration, technical expertise, and experience of the firm, including all principles and key staff of the firm, its consultants, and project personnel, with projects of types described both in urban and remote locations.

The selected firm, if a large business, must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting goals for this contract are that a minimum of 15% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small business, 5% shall be placed with women-owned businesses, 5% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, and 3% to be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal;  however, contract award is contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES:  In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the  ceiling amounts and the effect these “pass-throughs” would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms wishing to be considered must submit completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255 and other PERTINENT information. Pertinent information submitted in support of the completed SF 254’s and 255’s should not exceed 15 pages.  SF 254’s and 255's must also be submitted for subconsultants. Clearly, specifically, and concisely address the evaluation criteria when completing the forms. Offerors are requested to submit one original of their submittal. Other marketing information such as booklets, pamphlets and brochures is neither requested nor desired. Submittals must be received in the contracting office by no later than 4:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, 30 days after issuance of this request in order to be considered for selection Note:  This is not a Request for Proposals

<DESC>The United States Department of Education seeks capability statements from small businesses, as well as comments from all interested parties, on the proposed acquisition synopsized below and fully outlined in the attached draft SOW (follow the "Draft Statement of Work 01" link above).  

The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) in the U.S. Department of Education expects to request proposals for the development and maintenance of the What Works Clearinghouse.  The Clearinghouse will document what works in education in multiple topic areas, providing a national registry of educational interventions.   More specifically, it will be an easily accessible and searchable, web-based online database of products, programs, and practices that are claimed to enhance student academic outcomes.  Claims of effectiveness will be assessed with respect to the quality, quantity, and relevance of evidence, as well as the magnitude of effects of interventions--as determined through reviews of research.  It will also include a registry of evaluators who are prepared to conduct evaluation studies that will meet high quality standards as determined by the Clearinghouse.  

A core expectation of the Department is that the interventions in the  registry can be successfully adopted by a significant number of educational practitioners throughout the nation.  Therefore the system designed under the contract must ensure that listings in the registry have high potential for transportability to many other settings.  

The Department anticipates that major tasks will include:  1) developing and implementing a communication and collaboration strategy; 2) creating and supporting an expert technical advisory group to give feedback to the contractor; 3) developing standards and criteria for conducting study reviews and preparing evidence reports; 4) creating and maintaining a registry of evaluators committed to the Clearinghouse standards and criteria; 5)
identifying topic areas for broader evidence-based research reviews, and for test instrument reviews (optional); 6)  
conducting reviews of effectiveness studies and preparing evidence reports; 7) conducting special "fast track" reviews and syntheses (optional); 8) developing and supporting a web-based online system and databases.  

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  The Department is placing this notice to solicit questions and comments and begin an exchange of information with the public in order to release the best possible solicitation.  All interested parties should read the draft SOW by following the "Draft Statement of Work 01" link above.  

Capability statements from small businesses, as well as comments from all interested parties, should be submitted to Nicole Ragno, Contract Specialist, at Nicole.Ragno@ed.gov by 12:00 pm on Thursday, February 7, 2002.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), requires a contract for Gypsy Moth DDVP Pest Dispensers.  A first article sample of 100 units is required for Government testing within 10 days following the notice of contract award from the Contracting Officer. The first article sample provided and the product produced by the Contractor under any subsequent contract must come from the same production facility.  This is a request for proposals (RFP) for a commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 and FAR 15.  A firm, fixed-price, definite delivery contract is anticipated. The effective period of the contract will be from date of notice of award through September 30, 2002, with two (2) 1-year unilateral renewal options to extend the effective period of the contract and optional separately priced line items to purchase up to an additional 250 to 1000 pouches (50 dispensers per pouch) each period.  A guaranteed quantity of 2,367 pouches is anticipated for each contract period.  However, APHIS reserves the right to adjust the guaranteed contract during the option years based on program needs and available funding. It is anticipated that a single award will be made.  However, the Government reserves the right to award to make multiple contract awards if necessary to acquire the guaranteed and optional quantities required.  Interested companies responding to this synopsis will be mailed a copy of the RFP and provided an opportunity to submit a proposal for consideration for award.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government based on the following evaluation factors:  The offeror's past performance in complying with contract delivery schedules, problems encountered on previous contracts or purchase orders, and the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the ability to comply with current delivery requirements, and cost or price and other price related factors.  References are required for evaluation purposes.  For the purpose of this procurement, past performance and the ability to meet current contract delivery requirements are equally weighted and slightly more important than cost or price and other price related factors.  The solicitation (RFP) will be issued on or about February 11, 2002, to prospective offerors.  Offers are due to the Contracting Officer by 2:30 P.M., Central Time, Wednesday, March 12, 2002.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED. This solicitation is issued as a 100% small business set aside. NAICS Code: 325998.  Size Standard: 500 Employees. Interested companies may request a copy of the RFP by sending a fax or e-mail request to the Contracting Officer at (612) 370-2106.  The RFP may be downloaded off the Internet after February 11, 2002, or within 2 days after the issuance of the RFP, from the following Internet site: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html  TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR A COPY OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>Counter Underground Facilities Unattended Ground Sensor System Initiatives SOL BAA 02-04 proposals, POC: Dr. Dan Cress, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  Facsimile: (703) 696-2203, E-mail: baa02-04@darpa.mil (email contact preferred).  Contractual point of contact: DARPA Contracts Management Office (CMO), Attn: Ms. Kristen Numrych, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  

OBJECTIVE: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) is soliciting proposals (technical and cost) and white papers from qualified contractors for the assessment and development of Counter Underground Facility (CUGF) technology.  Underground facilities (UGFs) are a serious and growing asymmetric threat to national security and operational dominance.  The purpose of this BAA is to fund research and development efforts to enhance DoD's capabilities for enabling either functional or physical defeat of specific UGFs and securing information for battle damage assessment.  This BAA solicits responses in two discrete work areas.  In Work Area 1, full proposals are solicited to develop and demonstrate a functional (non-form factored) prototype ground sensor system for monitoring critical activities and for localizing vulnerabilities for facility attack.  The sensor system includes sensors, local communications, and algorithms.  For the demonstrated system, all sensor and communication nodes are hand-emplaced; the sensitivities of the sensors are clutter limited.  The focus is on monitoring and localization of power and ventilation systems. The system will exploit, but not be restricted to passive acoustic, seismic, and electromagnetic (PASEM) observables.  In Work Area 2, this BAA solicits innovative methods and/or designs for detection and exploitation of UGF-related observables in situations ranging from the tactical use of caves to strategic-level UGFs.  Areas of interest include novel sensors, exploitation algorithms, signal processing, and sensor system planning, deployment, communications, and modeling. 

ACQUISITION INFORMATION: Work Area 1 solicits qualified offerors (teams are encouraged) to submit proposals for the development, demonstration, and delivery of a complete functional prototype ground sensor system that includes, but is not limited to, passive seismic, acoustic, and electromagnetic (PASEM) observables.  Proposals are due 17 May 2002.  It is anticipated that Work Area 1 proposals will be classified.  Work Area 2 solicits white papers from the widest number of offerors, including qualified corporations, research centers, universities, FFRDCs, and DOE laboratories.  Work Area 2 white papers or proposals will be accepted for consideration up to 24 months from the date of this BAA announcement. Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.106, this announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute DARPA's solicitation for this BAA. 

A technical evaluation of all proposals will be accomplished through a review of each proposal considering the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: (1) innovative and creative technical approaches; (2) understanding of the technical issues and risks; (3) soundness of the technical and management approach; (4) offeror's relevant experience, facilities and availability of qualified, experienced technical personnel; (5) organization, clarity and thoroughness of the proposal.  Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of lower priority than the technical evaluation.  Specific criteria for each category of document, i.e., proposal or white paper, can be found in the PIP.  Two awards are anticipated for Work Area 1, while multiple awards are anticipated for Work Area 2.  Toward this end, DARPA will consider all types of proposals including traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and Other Transaction Agreements.  No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of the solicited tasks for exclusive competition among the entries.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposals must be submitted in accordance with the PIP.  Proposals that do not meet the specified format described in the PIP will not be considered for award. A classified PIP is available to offerors meeting security requirements for Work Areas 1 and 2; requirements for obtaining a copy of this PIP are described below.  For Work Area 2, an unclassified version of the PIP addressing general innovative methods is available; selected topics are not included in the unclassified PIP.  For offerors submitting an unclassified proposal or white paper for Work Area 2, the unclassified PIP is sufficient.  A copy may be requested by following the directions provided at the BAA web site, http://www.darpa.mil/spo/solicitations.htm.

Offerors may obtain a classified Compact Disk (CD) containing the classified PIP and the DARPA CUGF Security Classification Guide (SCG) 183 by faxing their facility clearance level, Defense Security Services CAGE code and classified mailing address to Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), fax number (703) 524-2449 (Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson/BAA 02-04).  Please identify the specific information being requested and the name and telephone number of the requester.   

Work Area 1. There will be a SECRET/NOFORN Briefing to Offerors covering Work Area 1 on or about 27 February 2002.  Additional Government-furnished Data will be provided on or about 10 April 2002.  The briefing dates, starting times and specific locations will be posted on the BAA Website.  All interested parties must have a current visitor request and security clearance on file with DARPA in order to attend these briefings.  Visitor requests and security clearances should be mailed to 4001 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 650, Arlington, VA 22203, Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson; or faxed to (703) 524-2449 (Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson/baa).  Offerors responding to Work Area 1 of this BAA will submit a full proposal and make a two-hour oral presentation.  Proposals for Work Area 1 are expected to be classified SECRET/NOFORN in accordance with SCG 183 and must be double wrapped with the outer wrapping address to DARPA/SPO, 3701 N. Fairfax  Drive, Arlington, VA 22203, ATTN: BAA 02-04/Document Control.  The inner envelope should include the same street address and be marked to the ATTN: Dr. Dan Cress.  All proposals for Work Area 1 must be received by 4:00 p.m. (EDT) on 17 May 2002.  Proposals submitted by fax or electronic mail will not be considered.  Unclassified questions regarding this BAA or PIP must be sent to baa02-04@darpa.mil.  A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) compilation including DARPA responses will be posted on the BAA Website every Friday for the time period between the Briefing to Offerors and the deadline for submission of proposals.  Other postings may be made as deemed appropriate.  Awards are anticipated during May 2002.  A table of important dates and milestones is provided in the PIP.  

Work Area 2. White papers are encouraged.  White papers or proposals will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.  There is no predetermined schedule for submissions or for granting awards.  Submissions are encouraged as early as possible.  This work area will be left open for 24 months after BAA publication. The first round of evaluations will take place beginning on or about 45 days after BAA publication.  Unclassified white papers or proposals should be mailed to DARPA, 3701 N. Fairfax, Drive, Arlington, VA 22203, ATTN: Dr. Dan Cress/BAA 02-04.  Offerors anticipating submittal of classified white papers or proposals under Work Area 2 should request the classified PIP and SCG 183 as per the procedure presented above.  The classified white paper or proposal must be mailed in accordance with the procedure identified for Work Area 1 proposals.  Following the Work Area 1 briefing on or about 27 February 2002, there will be a SECRET/NOFORN Briefing to Offerors for Work Area 2 that will cover selected areas of specific interest.  All interested parties must have a current visitor request and security clearance on file with DARPA in order to attend these briefings.  Visitor requests and security clearances should be mailed to 4001 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 650, Arlington, VA 22203, Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson; or faxed to (703) 524-2449 (Attn: Ms. Mary Thomson/baa). Unclassified questions regarding Work Area 2 and this BAA or PIP must be sent to baa02-04@darpa.mil.  FAQs for Work Area 2 will be updated as appropriate and posted on the BAA Website.  Work Area 2 awards will be made on an individual basis throughout the duration of the BAA.  

The government shall not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation or submission.  Proposals submitted shall be in accordance with this announcement and the PIP.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Each cost proposal shall contain a section addressing the following: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.

It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Government intends to use non-government personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation.  Support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose.  Contractor personnel are required to sign the Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements.  By submission of its proposal, each offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.

<DESC>The Virginia Contracting Activity (VaCA), on behalf of The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and the Joint Intelligence Virtual Architecture (JIVA) program is seeking white papers for a highly integrated Knowledge Discovery (KD) toolkit.  This is a sources sought announcement. JIVA is a congressionally mandated program within the General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP) and is the primary DOD intelligence community?s program for infusion of commercial information technology in support of intelligence analysis and production processes.  Because the desired suite of KD tools does not presently exist as an integrated set, development of the KD toolkit will likely be a technical and functional integration of emerging state of the art components with each other and within the JIVA Enterprise architectural framework.  White papers are being sought from both Industry and Government sources, and should specify a complete end-to-end solution that satisfies the top-level requirements identified below.  

The immediate goal is to identify candidate KD tools to evaluate as part of a JIVA lab-based concept exploration effort during the summer of 2002, with accreditation and deployment on the operational JIVA Enterprise in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2003.  

The KD toolkit is required to support immediate on-going DoD Intelligence Counter Terrorism efforts.  However, its use will likely extend beyond Counter Terrorism to the general military intelligence analyst population and the JIVA enterprise.  Traditional intelligence problems, such as assessing the military forces, capabilities, and intentions of foreign nations, generally involve analyzing data within both structured and unstructured databases and known hierarchies.  However, the asymmetric threat problem, specifically the terrorism threat, involves assimilating a great deal of data from the CIA, NSA, DoS, FBI and INS; Intelligence Community real time message feeds and mail systems; and open source HTML/XML and free text.  In addition, the Counter Terrorism analyst must often think outside the box in terms of established rational Western Standards of analysis and thus the ability to conduct what-if drills is paramount.  A central concept involves establishing relationships between data points and testing operational assumptions.  Nevertheless, because of the volume and inconsistency of raw data, it is imperative that proven analytical methodologies be applied and that advanced information technology tools are employed.

This KD toolkit is envisioned to provide the Counter Terrorism analyst with an end to end solution that can: (1) Create refined complex queries (searches) to manually identify/extract entities/relationships or the intelligent agents to find them automatically from the JIVA Virtual Knowledge Base (VKB), and potentially other compartmented data sources/repositories used by the CT community.  The evolving VKB contains all types of unclassified and classified multi-media, unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.  VKB will provide seamless access to intelligence counter terrorism data bases and other databases such as MIDB, MEPED, EWIR, and focus on global data access.  It will be important for the tools to filter out unnecessary data, process incoming data in near real time, apply analyst defined taxonomies, and store data in an ODBC/JDBC compliant database.  Analysts will need to be able to query sources using both natural language and key words.  This component is called the Advanced Data Mining component; (2) Visually recognize significant patterns, relationships, and timelines in those returned results.  It will be important for the analyst to exploit the data for further discovery.  This component is called the Data Visualization component; (3) Create and test hypotheses through a question and answer interface that can resolve ambiguities and enable the analyst to build and test what if scenarios.  This component is called the Question andAnswer component; and, (4) Build the final intelligence analysis through use of a Link Discovery and Visualization tool that can structure output based on user pre-defined relationships (models, formats, templates). Through this component, the analyst can visualize and present the linkages uncovered in the data for use by other analysts throughout the community, overlay the analysis on imagery or maps; and discover unknown relationships based on automated natural language processing.

The JIVA program has already invested in several potentially relevant technologies that can be applied to the intelligence analysis problem and consideration should be given to exploiting the capabilities of these tools.  If recommended, they can be integrated into the KD toolkit.  These are Visual Analytic?s Visual Links, Autonomy, Presearch?s Pathfinder for the Web analytical tools, and the JIVA Geographic Information System which is built around ESRI?s ARCIMS software.  It is strongly emphasized that white papers will not be penalized in any way if they do not include any of these tools.  JIVA is forward-looking and is not wedded to any of its existing capabilities; however, JIVA is hopeful that some of its past investments can be exploited in an integrated KD solution.  

The proposed Knowledge Discovery Toolkit must be compatible with the JIVA three-tier (Presentation (web browser), Business/Application logic, Data (VKB)) enterprise software architecture.  As such it must meet the following critical requirements: (1) scalable to a large geographically separated analyst population numbering in the thousands on the JWICS SCI network with possible extension to the SIPRnet SECRET environment.; (2) Web-enabled without/minimal client load, IE/Netscape independent, and Java Run-Time Environment  (JRE) 1.3 compatible; (3) capable of being accessed and secured through the Sybase Enterprise Portal 2.0 framework which is the implementation of the JIVA Enterprise software architecture; and, (4) supportive of a federated instantiation of  geographically separated clustered servers managed by a combination of the  JIVA Enterprise Management System (JEMS) software composed of Tivoli and BMC modules, and hardware by F5.  Full J2EE compliance is strongly desired to ease integration within the JIVA Enterprise software architectural framework (Sybase EP 2.0). A major component of the back end data repositories is in IBMs DB2 format.

The analytical review of submitted white papers will heavily emphasize the following in priority order: (1) Potential effectiveness in providing focused responses to analyst queries, and, ability to discover new relevant information; (2) Simplicity of interface and ease of use without training; and, (3) Compatibility with a web-based enterprise architecture and scalability to a large analyst population.  

Responses should be unclassified, as short as possible, but in no case more than ten 8.5x11 pages.  Responses are requested 20 business weekdays from the date this announcement is posted.  Responses should be provided electronically via an e-mail enclosure (in MS Word 2000 format without macros) to the following addresses: mdshaffer@hotmail.com; dennis.lair@dia.mil; jim.dashiell@dia.mil.  The file should be uncompressed and not exceed 200 KB in size. 

Any amplifying information (e.g. white papers) should be posted on the Internet and URL pointers provided within the response.  Questions regarding this RFI should be directed to either Mike Shaffer (202)231-2189 or Dennis Lair (202)231-3821.

Upon completion of the white paper review, the JIVA Program Office will select up to three of the most promising solutions presented and request briefings at the Defense Intelligence Analysis Center, Bolling AFB, Washington, D.C.  If merited, a contract may be extended to up to three sources to build and demonstrate a funded concept exploration prototype in the JIVA Secure Test and Integration Center (STIC).  This prototype will be connected to real-world SCI data and be evaluated by a group of analysts and technical experts.  It is highly desirable to have SCI cleared development personnel available to support the initial installation and connection to data sources and analyst training. The concept exploration prototypes must be ready for analyst evaluation by 1 June 2002 because the JIVA program intends to commit to an enterprise deployment decision before the end of September 2002. The person assigned this sources sought is Mr. James Sparks (202) 231-2134.

This NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations. NO PRODUCT SU BSTITUTIONS/EQUIVALENT PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. All quotations (with capability statements) received by 8 February 2002 will be considered by the Government; however, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based  upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information  received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Statement of Work for this action has been determined to be severable and is revised as follows: Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) Refinements, Integration and Support 1.0	 Objective The objective of this effort is to provide technical and engineering support to the Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Information Dominance Center (IDC) in the refinement of the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) to focus its capabilities on real-t ime Indicators and Warnings (I&W). 2.0	Background Intelligence and counter-intelligence support to force protection, and for protection of all US persons at home and abroad, continues to pose an immediate and perplexing problem.  This has been re-emphasized by the recent terrorist attacks.  Events such as  this ultimately lead to the suggestion of some intelligence failure.  In fact, given the diversity of the threat and the staggering amount of information available, the intelligence analyst is often too overloaded with a wide variety of diverse data to be  able to perform comprehensive and, most significantly, timely analysis.  The problem is compounded by the likely fact that there will not be one key piece of information.  The more likely situation will be a pattern of small, seemingly unrelated events th at, unfortunately, will be recognized only after the fact during the inevitable extensive investigations and postmortems.  The same scenario applies to less violent, but equally dangerous threats posed by foreign intelligence organizations and those who wo rk for them.  The counterintelligence activities of the United States protect not only our physical and military security, but our economic security as well.  But, as in trying to predict where and when terrorist acts may occur, trying to detect possible o r likely counterintelligence threats often falls victim to the massive amounts of information that daunt the most diligent analytical efforts.  Furthermore, in both cases, information will likely be dispersed in many different locations and stored in many databases. CCM is one of the cornerstone technologies that the INSCOM IDC is using to address these problems.  It is used to organize, store and correlate both structured and unstructured information.   CCM organizes structured information based on the natural relationships among the data it contains.  In contrast to the relational model, CCM stores both data and the multidimensional relationships that together comprise information.  Correlation of this s tructured information is based on common data values and relationships.  For example, terrorist groups using the same cover terms in relationship to selected planning activities would be automatically grouped together by CCM.  The end result is a persisten t information space that supports intuitive navigation.  Starlight, a 3D visualization application developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, is one example of the IDC applications used to examine this information space. CCM uses a similar approach in working with unstructured, or free text, information.  The information is parsed and semantic relationships between words retained in the CCM structure.  Correlation takes place and documents are grouped by word usage.  The r esult is a detailed vocabulary specific to the corpus of documents being analyzed.  Sets of algorithms are then run against this structure to identify similarities in the way words are used.  Conceptual queries against the corpus of documents are now possi ble.  For example, a query requesting documents containing the concept of “terrorist bombings” will return documents containing the phrase “Shining Path dynamited a bus”.  This “tactical’ level concept query compliments the more strategic level queries pos sible with other IDC tools such as Autonomy. 3.0	Tasks The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equi pment, and data to successfully perform the following tasks.  Specific task deliverables are identified with each task.   3.1 Task 1 -  Develop Target Architecture and Specification The contractor shall determine the modifications necessary to scale CCM to support continuous processing and discovery of real-time Indicators and Warnings (I&W), for both local and global environments.  The focus of this effort will be on near real time d etermination of the concepts contained in an information stream (i.e. streaming concepts).  The relationships identified using the current version of CCM are sufficient for most of the questions asked about traditional military forces. However, supporting present full spectrum conflict indicates that additional “simple but implied” semantic conce pts need to be developed (e.g. “is related loosely too”, “could possibly be”, etc…). The strength of the implication must also be quantified. Documents can be decomposed into keyword phrases with up to two words preceding each keyword and two words after e ach keyword and the results represented by an object described by a set of hierarchically arranged attributes.  Using Syntactical Role Analysis (SRA) it is possible to compare the attributes of each object with all other objects and find a set of words with similar hierarchically arranged attributes. This comparison provides a means for finding a set of best-fit rel ated words that perform a similar syntactical role based on the data domain. Similarity between two words is established by comparing the number of shared phrases for the two words divided by the larger of the total number of phrases in the document corpus  that contain the words being compared. This approach has the effect of weighting word similarity higher if they share more similar usage and share fewer dissimilar usages. This analysis is language-independent, because it examines the sequential relations hip between words in sentences, independent of the language grammar. Such modifications/enhancements shall not be limited to software but shall also consider use of different hardware platforms.  The objectives of this task are: (1)	Define the tasks necessary to make CCM the cornerstone for launching the IDC’s high performance, inferencing and parallel computing efforts with emphasis on streaming concepts.   (2)	Describe the target architecture in terms of a hardware/software specification mapped to the tasks defined in (1) above. 3.1 Task 2 - Continuous Processing and Discovery of Real-Time Indicators and Warnings (I&W), Local and Global Environments (i.e. streaming concepts).  The government shall review the report produced under task 1.  Based on those approved portions of the target architecture, the contractor shall make the required modifications to the CCM . 3.3 Task 3  - Integration and Testing Support The contractor shall provide continuous subject matter expertise for Integration and Testing Capability of the CCM throughout the modifications.  This will include support for installation, system administration, upgrade and troubleshooting of CCM installa tions. 3.4 Task 4 - Training  The contractor shall provide ten training sessions lasting one to three days.  Training will be conducted at the location determined to be most cost effective to the Government (HQ INSCOM; contractor facility; or software developers/maintainers locations). 4.0	Deliverables.   The contractor shall provide the following deliverables in support of this SOW: 4.1.1.	Technical Report (including proposed architecture) defining the tasks necessary to perform Task 1. 4.1.2.	CCM Software modified IAW the government approved tasks. 4.1.3.	Algorithms required to create domain specific vocabularies that support near real time determination of the concepts contained in an information stream. 4.1.4.	Software that implements algorithms identified in 4.1.3. 4.1.5.	Domain Specific Vocabularies. 4.1.6.	Monthly Progress Report to include description of wor k accomplished, status of funds, hours expended and any issues. 5.0	Period of Performance.  The total period of performance for this effort is 18 months from date of award.  6.0	Optional Task 1. The contractor shall evaluate existing and emerging technology and identify candidate hardware platforms that offer the potential to scale CCM to meet future projected data transfer rates.  Following government selection of  a candidate platform, the contr actor shall make the necessary modifications to the CCM software to allow it to function on the selected hardware. 6.1  Deliverables. 6.1.1	Technology Evaluation Report 6.1.2	Scaled version of the CCM software. 6.2	Period of Performance.  The period of performance for Optional Task 1 is 12 months from award. 7.0	Optional Task 2. 		The contractor shall examine the existing CCM algorithms used in structuring and manipulating discrete data and identify ppotential changes and/or new algorithms that potentially will define implicit relationships among correlated data.  Based on governm ent approval, the contractor shall implement these algorithms in the existing CCM engine. 7.1	Deliverables. 7.1.1	Algorithm Evaluation Report 7.1.2	CCM Based Inference Engine Software 		7.2  Period of Performance.  The period of performance for Optional Task 2 is 12 months from award.  (End of Statement of Work.) This is a 100% set-aside for small business, NAICS  Code 541330, Small Business Size Standard $4M.

Precision Armaments Laboratory (PAL) 
(also known as the Precision Munitions Facility (PMF))
Information Technology (IT), Meteorological, Instrumentation and Sensor Support Services

1.0 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A major mission within the US Army's Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) is the life cycle development of gun fired precision munitions and other systems that employ sensors (e.g., weapon fire control, command and control, battlefield damage assessment, communication, etc.).  All of these weapon systems have a requirement to operate in "all weather" or "near all weather" conditions.  

TACOM-ARDEC received a FY99 Military Construction ? Army (MCA) appropriation for the design and construction of a Precision Armaments Laboratory (PAL) (also known as the Precision Munitions Facility (PMF)) to establish a cost effective means of producing weapon and sensor systems that are capable of meeting the Army's "all weather" performance requirements.  The facility will provide the means for conducting sensor performance measurements during adverse weather occurrences in such a way that duplicates, as nearly as possible, the actual weapon system sensor attitude and range with respect to the target.  In addition, measurements that fully characterize the effect(s) the adverse weather has on target signatures and associated backgrounds (i.e., clutter) will be made.

To be constructed at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the facility consists of a 200 foot tower with an enclosed equipment platform at the top of the tower, open equipment platforms at the 40, 80, 120 and 160 foot levels, and two laboratory elevators; a base laboratory building; three target areas; and an intermediate instrumentation pad (that supports long range measurements).  

The purpose of this contract is to provide for the planning, hardware identification and installation, software development, facility layouts, training, technical support, etc. that must commence in order to facilitize the tower, laboratory building and target areas to achieve initial and complete operational capabilities to measure meteorological conditions and to assess sensor performance in adverse weather.

2.0 SCOPE:  The scope of this contract is to provide for time and material support for the planning, hardware identification and installation, software development, hardware and software integration, facility operational support, training, technical support, and marketing that must commence in order to facilitize the unique, newly constructed, Precision Armaments Laboratory. Specific attention will be paid to the tower, laboratory building and target areas to achieve initial operational capabilities to measure meteorological conditions and to assess sensor performance in adverse weather.  Additionally, specific knowledge and experience, to assure meeting mission essential facility requirements, will be applied in the areas of: weapon system concepts; weapon system sensor/seeker design, fabrication and field testing; weapon system sensor/seeker data collection and evaluation; adverse weather phenomenology as applied to weapon system sensor/seeker performance and target and background interaction; meteorological instrumentation; tower design and construction for weapon system sensor/seeker measurements; and weapon system sensor/seeker test facility set-up, operation and data collection.  As indicated, this effort focuses on a number of aspects that will ensure the establishment of a mission capable facility in terms of its design, construction, operational aspects, planning aspects, meteorological equipment installation and integration, and automation.  The end result is to establish an initial facility operational capability that permits automated meteorological data measurement, recording, and unit under test operation and is totally responsive to the PAL?s mission requirements.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but market research to determine the state of required technology.  The Force Protection Command and Control Systems Program Office wishes to identify potential technology for a Personal Identification Credential System (PICS) for the purpose of providing positive access control at restricted perimeters.  A potential concept of operations would be: an authorized individual, driving a vehicle and approaching a restricted and sensored boundary, would activate the PICS (via a biometric measurement).  The PICS would then communicate with an associated entry control system to place sensors in temporary access or open gates, allowing the authorized person to pass through the restricted boundary without stopping.  The identification data should be transmittable by a transponder over a distance suitable to facilitate a constant flow of traffic through a base gate.  Another method of describing the desired system is that it is a long range proximity card that only transmits when in the possession of a particular individual.  The PICS should provide an all weather capability. The unit should be roughly credit card size, weigh no more than three oz, and be producible at low cost.  Response to this market research should include evidence of experience in accomplishing the scope of work indicated and a plan for demonstrating a laboratory model.  The Government will review responses to determine the necessity and scope of a research and development effort to provide the required capability for testing. Please note that the [HANSCOM] Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB) will be the primary source of information for this acquisition.  Interested parties should check for updates frequently and subscribe to the HERBB update service for the "Personal Identification Credential System Project".  Interested potential sources should submit packages containing the above requested information, in writing, within 15 days of this publication to ESC/FDK, 5 Eglin Street, Building 1624 1st Floor, Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2100, Attn: Ms. Alicia Gettman.  Responses should not exceed 10 one-sided 8 1/2"x11" pages.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Joseph P. Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development. You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection. You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes an official Sources Sought synopsis. The intent is notify potential contractors of the upcoming Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) acquisition (NAIC code 811219 and size standard $6,000,000 -- effective 22 Feb 02). The contractor will provide Non-Personal services for PMEL at F. E. Warren AFB, WY. These services shall include tenants and other off-base activities receiving support from F. E. Warren AFB. The contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, materials, tools, supervision, and other items necessary to manage, test, calibrate, repair, modify, certify and perform maintenance on all assigned equipment and test equipment under AFMATCAL calibration procedures, technical oversight and lab accreditation. Operation of the PMEL shall be of such quality as to provide the professional level of calibration certification required in the T.O.s to assure prescribed accuracy, trace ability, and reliability of all test, measurement and diagnostic equipment. The Government will provide Government-Furnished Property, to include standard testing equipment and a facility that has been inspected for compliance with OSHA and meets AFMATCAL requirements. This acquisition will be a Performance-Based Service Contract, which we will structure around "what" is required as opposed to "how" the contractor should do the work. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government at this time; it is the Government's intent to award a one-year basic contract with four one-year option periods. The successful offeror will be selected based on a Best Value Decision, with the intent of utilizing Price/Performance Tradeoff procedures. The anticipated RFP issuance date is 29 March 2002. In order to assess set-a-side possibilities, interested parties are invited to respond by submitting a letter identifying your business as; 1) small business (SB), 2) 8(a), 3) HUBZone small business, 4) small disadvantaged business (SDB), 5) woman-owned small business (WOSB), or 6) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) under NAIC 811219 with a size standard of $6,000,000. Questions should be addressed to Joe Kirkland, at 307-773-4751.
Attention: Contractor must be registered with Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DoD activity. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

DESC: This synopsis is being used as a tool to perform market
  research for the Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, Mountain
  Home Air Force Base, Idaho. The AEF Battlelab is interested
  in partnering with an independent, nonprofit organization with
  a 501(c)3 status. The mission of the Air Expeditionary Force
  Battlelab (AEFB) is to identify and rapidly prove the worth
  of innovative ideas for the Commander in Chiefs' employment
  of Air Expeditionary Forces for Global Engagement throughout
  the entire spectrum of warfare. To complete this mission, the
  AEFB focuses on concepts that are able to reduce deployment
  support structure, reduce mobility response time, and increase
  deployed combat capability and effectiveness. Concepts based
  on mature technology are solicited under a Broad Agency Announcement.
  Those evaluated as Category I may be demonstrated and evaluated
  for merit. After demonstration of an initiative and based on
  the outcome of the demonstration, the AEFB makes a recommendation
  to senior Air Force leaders and the Air Force acquisition community.
  The recommendations help determine whether or not the Air Force
  should procure the items, move forward on a concept, or wait
  for future technology improvements. Contractors interested
  in gaining an entry point into the AF modernization process
  can present ideas through our Broad Area Announcement in Commerce
  Business Daily. Once a concept passes our screening and initial
  research, we validate and outbrief the concept in about eighteen
  months. The advantages for both the military and industry are
  tremendous. For industry, we provide analysis of the idea based
  on the expertise of subject area specialists and identify potential
  customers while guaranteeing that all concepts selected for
  evaluation will be visible to senior Air Force leaders and
  the acquisition community. From the military standpoint, concepts
  worked by the AEF Battlelab directly impact the Air Force and
  joint operations, improve efficiency and effectiveness for
  the warfighter, and introduce new technologies, tactics, procedures,
  architecture and/or doctrine into the Air Force. Concepts address
  improvements within any of the six phases of Air Expeditionary
  Force operations: readiness, deployment, employment, sustainment,
  redeployment and/or reconstitution. The government proposes
  a firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity
  (IDIQ) contract with a Basic year and Four Option years. Options
  will be exercised unilaterally by the government. This proposed
  contract will be a quick response vehicle used to provide a
  wide range of support services to include but not limited to:
  independent technical studies and analyses; conduct of site
  surveys and field data collection; evaluation of AEFB and other
  Department of Defense (DOD) initiatives, system demonstrations,
  tests, and validation and verification activities. Support  in the area of modeling and simulation; and the performance
  of program management; related administrative, security, documentation
  generation, and presentation support, program support throughout
  all phases of the demonstration or initiative, capability of
  systems or ability to meet mission requirements, including
  improved capability and effectiveness of a deployed AEF, support/assistance
  to AEFB in comparing the overall efficiency and effectiveness
  of proposed equipment/system replacements and evaluation of
  form, fit, function, and military utility of particular technologies.
  Successful contractor will be required to work closely with
  contractors that have been awarded a contract resulting from
  submission of a concept under a current Broad Agency Announcement.
  Further, the contractor will be required to provide analyses
  addressing the validity or degree of success of the demonstration.
  This market research will focus on non-profit organizations
  that can clearly demonstrate their experience and expertise
  in Department of Defense platforms including but not limited
  to: aircraft and missile systems, air operations and maintenance,
  weapons systems, intelligence, communications, logistics, space
  and radar systems, information systems, and other programs
  that directly support Centers of Excellence for the Federal
  Government, private industry and DOD.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS AND A REQUEST FOR CAPABILITIES STATEMENT FROM  SMALL  BUSINESSES.  The Environmental  Protection Agency is conducting a market search for small businesses to provide technical support for the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Office of Research and Development (ORD) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a Longitudinal Cohort Study Concerning Environmental Factors in Children's Health.  EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.  If there are an insufficient number of qualified small business concerns to ensure adequate competition, the Agency may elect to complete the requirement as a full and open competition. The Environmental Protection Agency is interested in planning, developing, designing, implementing and conducting a longitudinal cohort study which would be a multi-phase project addressing environmental risks to children's health.  Air, drinking water, pesticide residuals and other environmental exposures will be evaluated for their potential association with adverse health effects.  In the first few years of this contract, pilot studies, including methods development and validation studies, will be conducted that will fill data gaps and build capacity to conduct a large cohort study.  Following appropriate pilot work, pregnant women and/or women planning pregnancies, and their husbands or partners, who reside in a defined area of Central North Carolina may be recruited for a large scale study.   Pregnant women and their husbands or partners will be screened, followed through pregnancy and birth, and the ensuing children's cohort will be followed for a variety of health outcomes.  Intensive follow-up is planned for children who are at increased risk for certain health outcomes such as  asthma.  We are also interested in following children who have exposure to environmental chemicals and physical agents, including pesticides (residential and agricultural).

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:   NOTICE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE INDUSTRY:  The U.S. Department of State (DoS) is interested in identifying potential sources for digital copiers that operate to TEMPEST and Zone "A" and "B" standards.
The digital copier must operate and be maintainable by Department of State maintenance technicians and shall not require remote maintenance diagnostics that require telephone connectivity to the copier.  If a laptop or similar device is required to perform maintenance, such device, software, and license for use shall be provided and retained by the Government.  Power requirements are 110V, 60Hz and/or 220V, 50Hz.  If the system uses a hard disk drive, the drive(s) must be removable.  If memory is used in lieu of disk drives to store images, that memory must be volatile and must be erased entirely when power is removed for less than one minute.   Copy speed must range from 25 to 50 pages per minute with a minimum of 600 X 600 dpi print, copy, and scan resolution.  Devices are to have State Department NT C-LAN connection capability that enables use as a network printer and scanner.     Inquiries regarding NT C-LAN connection capability requirements should be directed in writing (fax and e-mail acceptable) to the Contracting Officer listed below.
Digital copiers proposed may be recommended for evaluation for Tempest and Zoned use. DoS will facilitate new product testing at the vendor's expense.   Neither successful testing nor a positive evaluation will result in a State Department obligation to enter into procurements or contracts.  

This sources sought announcement does not constitute an RFP and does not obligate the Government in any way. All information received in response to this announcement that is designated "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Costs related to providing products for testing and evaluation, meeting TEMPEST and Zoned requirements, or any other costs are the sole responsibility of the vendor/manufacturer.   Any equipment submitted for testing is solely at the risk of the vendor.

SOLICITATION AMENDMENT 0004:

The purpose of this amendment is to make the following changes:

?The Means Cost Estimating System (MCES), Page 1, Unit Price Section, Table of Contents, Division Numbers 01100 thru 01500 700 0340 shall be incorporated into the contractor?s coefficient factors.  All remaining Division Numbers shall serve as the basis for establishing the value of work to be performed on a unit basis.?

Payroll burden is to be included in the contractor?s coefficient.

3.  Clarification:

<DESC>Please reference Sources Sought Synopsis, F08635-02-R-00034, issued on 01 November 2001.  The solicitation number is corrected to read F08635-02-R-0034 instead of F08635-02-R-00034.  An extra '0' was inadvertently added to the solicitation number.

In an effort to be more descriptive of the range of services that are required, the program name was changed from Software Engineering Services (SES) to Information Technology for Air Armament System Support (ITA2S2).  Because the name change seems to have caused confusion, we are reverting to the old program name, Software Engineering Services (SES).  

A draft solicitation is scheduled for issuance in March 2002.

<SUBJECT>46 -- Arsenic Treatment for Drinking Water Technology Transfer Opportunity
<DESC>Arsenic Treatment for Drinking Water 
Technology Transfer Opportunity

Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has developed a new material (patent pending), Specific Anion Nanoengineered Sorbents (SANS), that can be used for simple and cost effective removal of arsenic contamination in drinking water.  This new class of materials provides inexpensive and effective removal of anionic contaminants from drinking water and wastewater, without requiring costly pH adjustment.  SANS media can be used in both granular filter bed and coagulation/microfiltration water treatment systems, and can be disposed as nonhazardous waste.  The SANS materials will allow both rural and municipal water systems of varying water usage to meet the new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) arsenic drinking water standard of 10 parts per billion.  

SANS materials have been tested in laboratory batch and column tests, where they have surpassed the capacity and effectiveness of commercially available arsenic sorbent or coagulation materials.  SANS has been evaluated as both solid granules and as surface coatings on inexpensive substrates.  The latter application is a means to produce very inexpensive, but effective, arsenic sorbents.  Both sorbent media and coagulation/microfiltration technologies can be adapted for use in many water utility systems, thereby significantly reducing water utility compliance costs for the new EPA standard.  Additional laboratory tests demonstrate that SANS media can be used for treatment of other regulated anionic contaminants, such as chromate, perchlorate or pertechnetate.  Further technical information about SANS materials may be found at the following website: http://www.sandia.gov/eesector/gs/gc/SANS/index.htm.  

Sandia is making the SANS material and treatment technology available to commercial companies interested in partnering with Sandia to develop near-term and/or future applications of SANS for drinking or waste water treatment via licensing agreements.  For further information, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski by February 22, 2002 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1380, P. O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-1380.  Fax:  (505) 843-4163.  Please indicate the date and title of this CBD notice and if your company would be interested in entering into a licensing agreement with Sandia.

<SUBJECT>46 -- In-Situ Cleanup of As-Contaminated Groundwater Collaborative Research and Development Opportunity
<DESC>In-Situ Cleanup of As-Contaminated Groundwater
Collaborative Research and Development Opportunity

Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) has developed an innovative means for in situ fixation of dissolved arsenic in contaminated aquifers (patent pending).  The altered aquifer becomes, in effect, an in-situ 'filter' that removes dissolved arsenic from the extracted drinking water.  When the effectiveness of the in-situ filter degrades, the mineral surface coatings can be recharged by another injection of chemical additives to increase the arsenic-sorbing capacity of the aquifer.  

We have performed laboratory column tests on this in-situ water treatment technology.  This technology may be extended to include in-situ treatment of other anionic contaminants at DOE or industrial waste sites, including chromate, pertechnetate and perchlorate.  Sandia desires to pursue a collaborative research and development agreement (CRADA) with an as yet unidentified commercial partner to proceed with actual field tests.  We seek a partner with extensive experience in commercial in situ treatment of contaminants in groundwater aquifers.  All inquiries will be considered.

For further technical information, please visit our website: http://www.sandia.gov/eesector/gs/gc/SANS/index.htm.  All CRADA inquiries should be sent by mail or fax to Alane Dulski by February 22, 2002 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1380, P. O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-1380.
