<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a modification to an existing purchase order with Scaled Composites to build and accomodate temporary, removable, wing tip extensions for the Scaled's Proteus 281 aircraft.  These wing tip extensions would become the property of NASA Langley Research Center. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Scaled Composites as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  NASA LaRC  's existing purchase order with Scaled Composites is for engineering and flight operations to include payload integration, flight test and deployments for instrument validation flights with the Proteus 281.  The Proteus 281, a high altitude aircraft, is the only known aircraft with the combined low and high altitude (&gt; 50,000 feet) capability to meet the test and research requirements of large instrument payloads for NASA LaRC tests.  The proposed incorporation of temporary, removable wing tip extensions will allow the aircraft to reach additional altitude necessary for upcoming NASA LaRC tests which require instrument validation at altitudes exceeding 55,000 ft.  As the Proteus 281 aircraft and design are proprietary to Scaled Composites, they are the only source who can make the proposed modification and ensure aircraft reliability. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 25, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs, VA Heartland Network 15 Business Office, Leavenworth, Kansas, is planning a sole source contract to design, fabricate, deliver and install one (1) hot cell/glovebox at the Harry S. Truman Veterans Hospital in Columbia Missouri.  This combination radiation hot cell and radiation glovebox must be able to serve simultaneously.  The combination of a radiation hot cell/glovebox must incorporate three separate means of radioactive material handling devices in this unit, specifically the unit incorporates external mechanical manipulators, rod manipulates (ball tongs), and neoprene glove ports.  The techniques to prepare large quantities of radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer patients require that all features be incorporated into one single hot cell/glovebox unit.  The incorporation of all these features in to one function hot cell/glovebox unit is essential for safe handling and preparation of radio-pharmaceuticals by research personnel.   This is considered to be a sole source from Premier Technology Inc. of Pocatello, Idaho, because the unique features of this unit are not available from any other commercial manufacturer.  Other sources that believe they can meet VA needs must furnish information to this office by no later than noon on January 22, 2002.  Information may be mailed or it may be faxed to 913-758-6495.

The facility will provide the means for conducting sensor performance measurements during adverse weather occurrences in such a way that duplicates, as nearly as possible, the actual weapon system sensor attitude and range with respect to the target.  In addition, measurements that fully characterize the effect(s) the adverse weather has on target signatures and associated backgrounds (i.e., clutter) will be made.

To be constructed at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the facility consists of a 200 foot tower with an enclosed equipment platform at the top of the tower, open equipment platforms at the 40, 80, 120 and 160 foot levels, and two laboratory elevators; a base laboratory building; three target areas; and an intermediate instrumentation pad (that supports long range measurements).  

The purpose of this contract is to provide for the planning, hardware identification and installation, software development, facility layouts, training, technical support, etc. that must commence in order to facilitize the tower, laboratory building and target areas to achieve initial and complete operational capabilities to measure meteorological conditions and to assess sensor performance in adverse weather.

2.0 SCOPE:  The scope of this contract is to provide for time and material support for the planning, hardware identification and installation, software development, hardware and software integration, facility operational support, training, technical support, and marketing that must commence in order to facilitize the unique, newly constructed, Precision Armaments Laboratory. Specific attention will be paid to the tower, laboratory building and target areas to achieve initial operational capabilities to measure meteorological conditions and to assess sensor performance in adverse weather.  Additionally, specific knowledge and experience, to assure meeting mission essential facility requirements, will be applied in the areas of: weapon system concepts; weapon system sensor/seeker design, fabrication and field testing; weapon syste

<DESC>Indefinite quantity contract to provide supplemental Mechanical and Electrical Engineering services, along with a minor amount of associated Architectural services, based on, but not limited to, the issuance of work orders for the preparation of designs, plans, specifications, estimates, record drawings, miscellaneous studies and reports, interior design and space planning, surveys and construction inspection services for projects within the geographic borders of the states of Indiana and Illinois, except Cook County.  Projects may involve work in specialty areas such as alterations in historic buildings or asbestos abatement work.  Services may include assisting the GSA staff in "in-house" design and construction inspections.  The duration of the base contract will be one (1) year.  The contract will include a provision for four (4) options, each of which could extend the contract for an additional one (1) year period and may be exercised at the option of the Government.  The maximum order limitation is $750,000 for each one-year period.  The following have been identified as potential projects to be accomplished under this contract:  (1) "New Direct Digital Control (DDC) System?. (2) ?Chiller Replacement?. and; (3) ?HVAC Improvements Study?.  Projects of a similar nature may be substituted or added to the contract.  The selected firm must negotiate overhead and profit rates and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines for use in negotiating fixed price work orders.  For projects with an estimated construction cost of $750,000 or less, the Government may use the fixed price amounts provided in the Supplemental A/E Lookup Table provided during initial contract negotiations.  The Government, however, reserves the right to award a contract based on negotiated overhead, profit, and hourly rates only, as well as to use those rates for work orders which do not fall within the scope of the Lookup Table.  Consideration will be limited to firms having an existing active design production office within the geographic borders of the state of Indiana and Illinois, except Cook County.  Each joint venture must have an existing active design production office within the designated geographic limitations.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality design effort.  In addition, all firms and their consultants must:  (1) have in house CADD capabilities (compatible with the latest version of AutoCad) and; (2) use AIA Masterspec as the basis for developing the construction contract documents.  For Division 15 and 16 specification sections, the Architect/Engineer shall develop his/her own specifications edited to the full extent necessary for each specific project.  Any available specifications (AIA, Navy, Military, NASA, etc.) may be used as a guide in developing the individual specifications for Sections 15 and 16; the specifications, however, shall be prepared using the AIA Masterspec format.(3) have familiarity with Microsoft Project Software Program.  Selection to be based upon:  25% for Project Team, including key personnel with commitment to projects and qualifications and relevant experience as individuals and as a team; 15% for Design Management/Organization, including project management planning, coordination, scheduling, cost control methods, production facilities, capabilities and techniques for both design projects and construction inspection;  25% for Design Ability/Potential, including visual and narrative evidence of team's ability with respect to innovative design solutions; 35% for Demonstrated Design/Construction Experience, including demonstration of past performance of similar types of services on similar projects, including work in historic structures.  Responses must be received by GSA, 509 W. Capitol Ave., Suite 206, Springfield, IL 62703, not later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this notice by 4:00 P

<DESC>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assess the technical and financial feasibility of building a cyclohexanone/caprolactam facility.

Spolana a.s., located just northeast of Prague, manufactures chemicals with a specialization in ethylene-based products, such as PVC, raw materials used in making polyamide fibers, structural plastics, inorganic products and other specialty chemicals.  In 2000, Spolana?s sales totaled $219 million, but due to negative earnings in its services sector, it had negative earnings.  However, in October of 2001, the Czech Government decided to integrate Spolana into the Unipetrol Group, which will help facilitate the rationalization of Spolana?s chemical lines.  

Although the proposed facility is anticipated being built at Spolana, Unipetrol is also considering building it at the nearby Chemopetrol?s site.  Chemopetrol, also a subsidiary of Unipetrol, is the largest petrochemical company in the Czech Republic.  

Spolana has an existing Caprolactam unit, which is supplied by Cyclohexanone produced in the Slovak Republic, over 400 miles away.  Currently, benzene from Unipetrol?s nearby Chemopetrol facility is sent to the Slovak Republic by truck to produce Cyclohexanone, which is then shipped back to Spolana by truck for a roundtrip distance of over 800 miles to complete production.  

To reduce the transportation costs and the time lag, Unipetrol intends to streamline the production of Caprolactam through the production of Cyclohexanone at either Spolana or Chemopetrol.  With this change, either Spolana or Chemopetrol will be a captive user of the benzene produced and Unipetrol would be independent of outside producers.  Unipetrol would also like to increase the production of Caprolactam at Spolana from 40,000 t/year to 80,000 t/year.   Additionally, ammonium sulphate resulting as a by-product could influence the economics of the caprolactam unit.

The feasibility study will examine: 1) the technical and economic feasibility of manufacturing Cyclohexanone at either Spolana or Chemopetrol and 2) the expansion of production of Caprolactam to develop a business strategy.  Specifically, the feasibility study will entail the following tasks:

1)	Conduct site visits to Unipetrol, Spolana and Chemopetrol to collect data 
2)	Conduct a detailed benzene and hydrogen balance review
3)	Establish a basis for the feasibility study
4)	Develop a conceptual marketing study 
5)	Develop conceptual design documents
6)	Prepare preliminary equipment list and construction costs
7)	Perform a preliminary environmental assessment
8)	Develop capital requirements
9)	Economic/Financial Analysis ? including discussions with banks
10)	List of U.S. sources of supply

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $331,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  Additionally, Unipetrol, the Grantee, will be responsible for contributing an additional $66,000 towards the cost of the Feasibility Study.

<DESC>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for increasing benzene production.

Chemopetrol, a subsidiary of Unipetrol, is the largest petrochemical company in the Czech Republic.  Chemopetrol produces ethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene,
propylene, benzene, ethylbenzene, and agricultural chemicals.  The Litvinov site,
where this project  would take place, is located in the Usti nad Labem region,near
the German border.  Unipetrol is involved in oil refineries, primary petrochemicals and
agrichemical producers, plastics manufacturers, fuel distribution companies, and filling
station network operators in the Czech Republic.

Because of a unique feedstock, Chempetrol?s steam cracker is one of the most important unit operations at this site.  This study would examine ways to improve the efficiency of this steam cracker unit and increase benzene and/or styrene production (these ?sister compounds? are aromatics).  Additionally, the study would analyze whether an additional pyrolysis unit would be necessary.  However, if the costs of these expansions don?t justify the investment, Chemopetrol won?t undertake the project.  Therefore this feasibility study will be phased.

In the U.S. and Europe, a typical steam cracker feedstock contains 80 percent naphtha and 20 percent lighter products.  In contrast, the feedstock to this steam cracker contains more than 51 percent materials that are heavier than naphtha.  Consequently, its steam cracker yield of lower value liquid products (C5 cut, C9 cut, and fuel oil) are higher than usually expected.  (?Cuts? are different variants of pyrolysis gasoline ? each ?cut? has a different application in the chemical industry).  

The proposed project would analyze the best way to produce additional benzene and/or styrene from Chemopetrol?s steam cracker.  Chemopetrol intends to increase the capacity of its steam cracker from 435,000 ton/year to 560,000 ton/year of ethylene production, along the lines recommended in a Feasibility Study funded by TDA. This expansion will automatically increase production of other products, including the pyrolysis gasoline fraction. This would allow Chemopetrol to increase benzene production by about 35% from the current level of 176,000 tons / year to approximately 240,000 tons / year of 99,8% purity benzene.  It could also allow the recovery of byproduct styrene.

A Feasibility Study is required to determine the best technical and economical route to increasing benzene production from the Litv?nov steam cracker unit, considering the following possibilites:

?	Installation of new benzene extraction distillation
?	Styrene extraction 
?	De-bottlenecking existing Pyrotol Unit
?	Selling rest of BTX fraction, which cannot be processed by the existing Pyrotol unit

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $288,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  Chemopetrol, the Grantee, will be responsible for contributing $56,000 in in-kind labor towards the cost of the Study.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is seeking an independent contractor to conduct an inquiry and develop recommendations for consideration by sovereign tribal governments to support community members who have disabilities in four selected and interconnected areas--education, health, rehabilitation and independent living.  NCD determined these priorities through (a) a review of available reports that support the premise of linkages among these areas, and (b) recent conversations with advocates and professionals, including people with disabilities, representatives and leaders of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The project must analyze the status of previous findings and recommendations and describe practices that contribute to improving the quality of life for American Indians and Alaska Natives with disabilities living on tribal lands. NCD is interested in funding an investigation wherein the contractor will: (1) summarize recommendations from relevant research and reports on health, rehabilitation, and education issues that impact independent living and self-determination realities for people with disabilities living on tribal lands; (2) provide scheduled involvement for representatives of American Indians and Alaska Native communities, advocates, and key organizations concerned with issues of education, rehabilitation, health, and independent living as project advisers; (3) identify and recommend basic factors/elements and key processes that have been productive in getting sovereign governments to develop tribal laws to protect and meet the service needs of people with disabilities who live on tribal lands; (4) provide a capacity building ?toolkit? that must be user friendly, incorporate principles of cultural competency, and include as examples for consideration what seems to be working/what has been effective in different tribal setting; (5) assess and recommend overnment-to-government (state to sovereign tribal to U.S. government) improvements in relationships needed for effective coordination across existing federally funded projects/programs; and (6) plan to broadly disseminate the project materials among Native people.
 
The plan for this investigation should project a seven (7) month implementation work schedule. The approximate release and closing dates are January 30, 2002, and March 30, 2002, respectively. The estimated contract period of performance is seven months. Requests for copies of the RFP may be made by mail or picked up on or after the issue date at the NCD address.

<DESC>NA Th US Army Research Laboratory is planning to award, on a sole source basis (10 USC 2034(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source), a Blanket Purchasing Agreement (BPA) to MEMS Exchange, Corporation for National Research Initiatives, Reston, VA, for research, de velopment and fabrication for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) with a ceiling amount of $450,000 over a period of three (3) years with an option to extend the BPA for an additional 3 years with a ceiling of $450,000. The MEMS Exchange was establishe d by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as a way of facilitating access to MEMS microfabrication and research resources and to identify qualified sources for limited runs of specialty items. The MEMS Exchange coordinates a network of fab rication centers that lets users draft process sequences which are performed across the boundaries separating the individual facilities. Most existing state of the art clean room facilities are owned by private industry and are planned from IC production o r R&D, and generally do not provide micromachining process technologies.  The handful of companies traditionally involved in micromachining that have facilities do not make them available to others outside these companies for MEMS R&D, prototyping, or manu facturing.  The few fabrication facilities that are available often do not provide MEMS help or expertise, do not have a full range of MEMS process technologies available, cannot accommodate process flexibility, require the outside party to sign over intel lectual property, or are expensive and difficult to use.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)  seeks to increase level of effort  under a current contract for technical support services related to the administration of a File Net Image Processing System (IRS).  These services require an increase demand for system administration and analyst hours as a direct result of the increase in PBGC participants.  This is a continuation of work already undertaken by the existing provider.  Due to the complexities of PBGC's technical environment, limited PBGC Government staff for providing oversight, and the time spent learning the work and in order to ensure continuity of the work, it is PBGC's belief that it is in the best interests of the agency for the current contractor to complete the service for the duration of the contract.  This is not a request for proposal.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has a continuing requirement, Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) services, for independent, objective, and expert technical advice and assistance for ongoing and future information technology initiatives.  This is a re-competition of Contract No. 50PBPT800005, which is held by PRC, Inc.  The estimated release date of the Request for Proposal  (RFP) is expected on or about January 30, 2002.  The proposal will be due 30 days after release of RFP.  This requirement is to provide independent technical advice on system designs and engineering analysis, system-wide engineering and network analysis/re-engineering, document and record management systems (RM, DMS) suitable for USPTO, technology for e-commerce in USPTO's business areas, infrastructure engineering support services, security engineering, PKI engineering, communications infrastructure engineering and deployment, network engineering and deployment.  The SETA contractor will be responsible for the design and implementation of infrastructure system components.  The SETA contractor may also serve as an unbiased third party in the review of other Government contractors' plans, performance and products. The contractor must provide the following capabilities: engineering analysis, system-wide engineering and network analysis/re-engineering, USPTO document management Systems (DMS), electronic filing and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) standards, infrastructure engineering support services, security engineering, PKI engineering, communications infrastructure engineering and deployment, network engineering and deployment, business communications information technology, and technical support issues.

The PTO expects to award two performance-based service contracts as a result of this competition.  One of the contract awards will be to a small business.  The NAICS Code is "541519-OTHER COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES", for the small business contract. 
 The PTO intends to award each contract with a basic period of performance of one year with four (4) one-year options for renewal.  It is anticipated that the contracts will be Cost-Plus-Award Fee with task ordering provisions.  The anticipated annual level of effort for this requirement is 200,000 hours for the base year, and 180,000 hours for each of the options.  Businesses will be required to be located within the Washington, DC, metropolitan area to respond to the Government's advance 30 minutes requirement for meetings at the USPTO in Arlington, VA.      

The PTO would like to emphasize that the winning offerors of the SETA requirement will have a role as a close confidential advisor to the PTO. The SETA contractor will assist the PTO in evaluating the proposals, performance, and products of other contractors, thereby giving them access to proprietary information about potential competitors. The SETA contractor will also have access to proprietary, source-selection sensitive, or otherwise restricted information. Because of the close confidential relationship required of the SETA contractor, the PTO is concerned that this will cause other private sector firms to be reluctant in pursuing future work with the PTO, and that the release of proprietary information to the SETA contractor would have an adverse impact on competition in future procurements with the PTO.  In order to mitigate these concerns, the PTO intends to impose strong Conflict of Interest (COI) restrictions on the SETA contractor. These COI restrictions include the prohibition of the winning offeror, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultants, and subcontractors from participating (in any capacity) in any PTO procurements, other than those activities in direct support of the SETA contract, throughout the duration of the SETA contract (including options) plus an additional five years. The SETA contractor, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiari

<DESC>Statement of Work
Superconductivity Outreach and Analysis
December 18, 2001

A. Tasks

1.  Stakeholder Outreach and Information

1A.  The subcontractor shall arrange for booth spaces and/or speaking slots at up to two industry or stakeholder events during the year. The subcontractor will propose participation in events other than those typically attended by national laboratory or industry/university scientists and engineers who are working on superconductivity research.  Therefore, meetings such as the Applied Superconductivity Conference, the International Cryogenic Materials Conference, the Cryogenic Engineering Conference, the IEEE Winter Power Meeting, the IEEE T&D Meeting, and the Materials Research Society meetings will be excluded from the subcontractor's list of events to be staffed.  

1B.  The subcontractor will prepare a descriptive "Products and Benefits" brochure targeting the meeting audience in Task 1A and will provide an appropriate number of copies for use at the meeting.  The program leaders at each of the national laboratories participating in the Superconductivity Program will also be provided copies of this brochure.  The subcontractor will provide an electronic copy of the brochure for inclusion on one or more national laboratory web sites.

1C.  The subcontractor shall organize and manage a "HTS Stakeholder Group" composed of opinion leaders from key sectors such as superconductivity, electric power, environmental, state legislatures, the national security community, and trade groups (IEEE, ASME, and the like). Through meetings, conference calls or Internet conferencing technology, this advisory group shall share ideas and assist the national laboratories in communicating the benefits of HTS to their respective constituencies. It will also provide a forum for communicating stakeholders' concerns to the national laboratories. The subcontractor will maintain an ongoing dialogue with electricity stakeholders, both in the targeted sectors and in other stakeholder sectors, in attempts to facilitate their awareness and eventual acceptance of HTS in their operations. This dialogue shall be carried out by paper mailings, electronic mailings, visits, and other tools as the situations warrant. 

1D.  The subcontractor will issue via e-mail a periodic "HTS Update" newsletter.  The frequency of the e-mailing will be approximately once a month.  The newsletter will complement the information provided via normal channels (viz., the trade press, including Superconductor Week newsletter) and will be directed in particular to organizations and individuals who are not directly involved in producing products using superconductors.  Such groups might include the environmental community, engineering societies, utility architect-engineering firms, and public and investor-owned utilities.

2.  Analysis

2A.  The subcontractor will research and produce a report assessing the monetary value of non-energy efficiency benefits should high-temperature superconducting devices enter the commercial marketplace.  Such non-energy benefits include, but may not be limited to:

-removal of oil from power transformers
-overloadability of power transformers without loss of transformer life
-value of fault-current limiter function on HTS power transformer
-3-5 times the energy through the same sized duct under a city street (HTS cables)
-elimination of forced oil cooling of underground cables
-enhanced electrical characteristics of HTS generators
-enhanced security of the nation's power grid
-tradable environmental credits
-fault current limiter non-energy benefits
-flywheel non-energy benefits

2B.  The subcontractor will update and enhance the report found on the ORNL website
http//www.ornl.gov/HTSC/roadreports.htm

"Draft - Analysis of Future Prices and Markets for High Temperature Superconductors (September 2001)" to incorporate a market penetration feedback loop.  That is, the spreadsheet will be revis

<DESC>DESC: The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), Programs Management Division (IDI), Pathfinder 2003 Team (Pf 03) is submitting the following Request for Information regarding geospatial and imagery analysis exploitation tools or technologies to support the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS).

The objective will be to assess low- to high-end tools or technologies to exploit imagery to support tactical scenarios.  These tools should address one or more of the functional areas of interest to NIMA, the DCGS, and the Imagery and Geospatial Community (IGC) including, but not limited to, the four focus areas: imagery analysis and report generation; geospatial/geopositioning; fusion; and standards.  Tools should support selected operational scenarios; support the warfighters with a common, geopositioned operating picture; and assist analysts in the processing, screening, exploitation, and product generation of multi-intelligence data into targetable information.

The multi-intelligence (Multi-Int) benefits and the problem set to support the DCGS tactical scenarios include:
1)	Speed (automated systems are faster)
2)	Accuracy (more data, equates to more confidence)
3)	Relevance and Interoperability (focused on warfighter's unique requirements)

NIMA IDI is interested in finding DEVELOPERS or VENDORS of off-the-shelf (commercial or government-owned) tools or technologies, from low- to high-end, "beta or better" (6.3/6.4), who are experienced in the exploitation arena, which would support the DCGS. Based upon the responses to this RFI, the Pf 03 Team will select the exploitation tools and systems for assessment. If you or your organization is involved in the area of exploitation technologies, please refer to the procurement and contracts web site listed below for the scope of the tools or technologies supporting DCGS and white paper submission requirements. 

Further information concerning the details of this RFI, DCGS background, and a notional/graphical DCGS description of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force DCGS Exploitation Workflow Process (EWP) can be found on the NIMA Procurement and Contracts website, http://www.nima.mil/poc/contracts/r&d.html. Included in this website, in addition to the DCGS concept of operation and services processes, is an example of the Army's EWP and sub-process, which represents the Processing Exploitation and Dissemination steps.  Any changes will not be posted in the FedBizOpps, however; the web site will be updated as needed.  Please watch for date changes under the heading, as this will indicate information has been added/changed.

<CONTACT>Marilyn F. Williams, 703-325-1193
<DESC>NA This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will not receive a response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, and in no way obligates the Government i n an award of any contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in a joint program effort with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), is developing a series of test beds to develop and field systems that can defend against threats pose d by weapons of mass destruction (WMD), with a priority on nuclear weapons, using unconventional delivery means (e.g., delivery other than by missile or military aircraft). DTRA is currently seeking commercial technology solutions in order to enhance and i nnovate the Department of Defense's ability to detect, identify, respond, and prevent unconventional nuclear attacks by national, sub-national, or terrorist entities. DTRA and NNSA will jointly pool their technology and resources to develop this program to  deploy, test, and demonstrate nuclear protection systems beginning with two different U.S. military installations and potentially expanding to four U.S. military installations around the world. The program value is estimated to be $20M for a one year effo rt. This unique input from industry will ensure that the most current technologies and operational procedures are thoroughly reviewed in concert with the development of the acquisition strategy in order to efficiently and effectively fulfill the Statement of Objectives (SOO). DTRA is particularly interested in innovative products and/or services that can be used in detection, identification, and respond (command, control, communications (C3)) to unconventional nuclear warfare (and other WMD) and operational  procedures to deploy such (concept of operations (CONOPS)). DTRA welcomes and encourages all input from industry and is highly receptive to innovative and unique concepts with an emphasis on existing technology that can be deployed quickly. This is a rapi d response sources sought and thus, all interest and/or comments concerning this requirement shall be directed to: Marilyn F. Williams, Contract Specialist at marilyn.williams@dtra.mil by 23 January 02. All information, comments, questions, concerns, gener ated from this announcement are considered gratis. SOO: 1.0 Background: DTRA safeguards the U.S. and its friends from WMD by reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat.  The mission of Combat Support Directorate is to provide combat su pport to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Staff, the commanders-in-chief and the military services to deter, engage, and assess the threat and challenges posed to the U.S., its forces and its allies by WMD. Our focus is to support essential WMD respons e capabilities, functions, activities and objectives necessary to sustain all elements of forces in-theater at all levels of war and to assist in civil support. The recent terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 vividly demonstrate the need to greatly expan d governmental efforts to develop and field systems that can defend against threats posed by WMD. One of the most unsettling and dangerous threats to the U.S. homeland is the possibility of nuclear terrorism using unconventional methods. 2.0 Organizational  Objectives. The Defense Science Board (DSB) Task Force on Unconventional Nuclear Warfare Defense analyzed the capabilities of DTRA and NNSA and devised a strategy to materially improve DoD's ability to detect, identify, respond, and prevent unconventional  nuclear attacks. The DSB recognized that a substantial base of capability exists within DoD and DOE for dealing with this threat, but the resources have not been effectively organized and optimized. This joint program is designed to accomplish this organi zation and optimization. 3.0 Specific Objectives. The principal objective of this program is to develop unconventional nuclear warfare defens

The research program is slated to last for five weeks beginning in late May and involves cadets who have completed three years of university education at USAFA.  Some cadets will be allowed to expand their program to eight weeks.  The partner typically pays for the cadet?s travel, per diem and lodging expenses. Exceptions to this are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  USAFA continues to pay the cadet?s salary and benefits.  Non-federal agencies will execute a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a where appropriate.

Possible research areas are open-ended.  Cadets in the following majors will participate in the program:
 
Aeronautical Engineering
Astronautical Engineering
Basic Sciences
Behavioral Science
Biology
Chemistry to include Biochemistry and Materials Science
Civil Engineering
Computer Science
Economics

<SUBJECT>69 -- Recruit Training Command Battle Stations Exercise
<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  The Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando Florida is requesting current industry information regarding cost effective and high fidelity approaches in updating the Battle Stations Exercise.   Battle Stations is an end of recruit training exercise that reinforces skills developed throughout recruit training, and serves as a "rite-of-passage" experience, marking the transition of the individual from that of "recruit" to that of "sailor".  As part of a facilities modernization program at RTC Great Lakes, Illinois, the Navy desires to modernize the facilities, equipment and scenarios that comprise the Battle Stations experience, creating a realistic, state-of-the art training environment.  As part of this modernization, the Navy intends to merge the multiple locations into a single modern facility and update the realism and fidelity of the various scenarios.   In order to accomplish increased realism and fidelity for the Battle Stations Exercise, the Navy desires to explore the techniques utilized in entertainment attraction development to maximize the appeal of the Battle Stations Exercise.   Battle Stations currently consists of multiple buildings, mockups and equipment, that provide Navy recruits with a series of scenarios representative of high stress events experienced by Naval personnel in the real-world.  The Battle Stations Exercise consists of twelve individual scenarios and are described in the accompanying PowerPoint presentation.  To date, an initial effort has been performed to tie the Battle Stations scenarios into a single, continuous story-line and to incorporate techniques typically utilized by the entertainment industry to build expectation and promote believability for the participant.  The initial effort, conducted in cooperation with the entertainment industry, produced an initial concept which now must be refined, adapted to satisfy operational constraints, and finalized into an achievable experience.  Once finalized, the concepts developed in the initial efforts must be translated into detailed design documents suitable for acquisition of scenario equipment and for construction of the supporting facility.
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AN INDICATION THAT THE NAVY WILL CONTRACT FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.  NAWCTSD will not pay for information received in response to this RFI.  This is a market research tool, seeking innovative business solutions and training approaches.  This information will be used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to the issuance of any future Request for Proposal (RFP).     Interested parties are to submit a capability statement that shall include, at a minimum, any prior/current corporate experience in performing efforts of similar size and scope.  In describing your experience, include, if applicable, the contract number, organization supported, contract value, and a brief description of the effort performed.  Further, provide a company profile including name, address, POC, and the designated NAIC Codes in which you are qualified.  Provide a description of your company's technical qualifications and capabilities; a detailed design approach, in no more than 8 pages; and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM), estimating the cost and schedule for both the design and production phase.  The ROM is for planning purposes only and firms will not be held to any estimates or schedules provided should the government later decide to issue a Request for Proposal.  Special attention should be applied to experience in or with the entertainment industry.  Further, firms must designate the business size, i.e., large or small business.  If small, denote any qualifications as a Small Emerging Business or as a Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB).  Request you indicate any disadvantaged qualification and provide the specific disadvantaged group(s) applicable to your firm.  Denote any certification
