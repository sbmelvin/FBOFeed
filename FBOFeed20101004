<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a Time-and-Materials (T&M) contract which includes firm-fixed price and cost-reimbursement components to a qualified Contractor to provide local guard services to the American Embassy Paris, France; the Consulates Lyon, Marseille, Nice, Strasbourg, Rennes, Toulouse, and Boudreaux; the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial located in Normandy, France; and the European Biological Control Laboratory (EBCL) located in Montferrier, France.

The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561612 Security Guards and Patrol Services.  The Government plans to award one contract, and the anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.

The Contractor will be required to provide Standard Services as well as Additional or Emergency (A&E) Services, and the estimated number of annual hours of Standard Services is 257,190 and the estimated number of annual hours of Additional or Emergency Services is 12,861 for all locations listed above. 

The U.S. Mission to France requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent unauthorized access; protect life; maintain order; deter criminal attacks against employees and dependents; prevent loss, damage, or destruction to Government property; and deter terrorist acts against all U.S. assets. All members of the guard force shall act as an early warning signal to the Mission and comply fully with their General and Post Orders.  In accordance with Exhibit A (Guard Posts and Schedule of Guard Coverage), some posts are required to be manned 24 hours/7 days a week.

Each Contractor will be asked to provide fully burden hourly rates for all labor categories (i.e., Guard, Senior Guard, Guard Supervisor, SD Specialist, SD Analyst, SD Coordinator, SD Shift Supervisor, Deputy Guard Force Commander, and Guard Force Commander).  The fully burden hourly rates for Standard Services as well as Additional or Emergency Services shall include all wages (local labor law compliance if applicable and any premiums relating to overtime, holidays, or night shifts), overhead, fringe benefits, severance costs, general and administrative expenses and profit for each category of labor.

Contractor performance will be monitored through a Quality Assurance and Surveillance Plan.  For specific deficiencies in performance, the U.S. Government may deduct the estimated cost for the Government to provide the service in the absence of a contract employee or the additional administrative time incurred by the Government in correcting the performance deficiency.  

For certain deficiencies such as an unmanned position, the negative incentive for not meeting the Performance Standard is a deduction in the billing amount at the Governments estimate cost for providing the required service not to exceed the length of the guard shift.  

Some of the major tasks required of the Contractor are Entry Control (i.e., Office Building Entry Control, Official Residential Entry Control, Vehicle Entry and Access Control), Inspections, Use of Explosive and/or X-Ray Inspection Equipment, Patrols, Escort Services, Completion of Logs and Records, Operation of Closed Circuit Televisions (CCTV), Use of Guard Electronic Monitoring System (GEMS), Surveillance Detection Operations, Operation of Radio Network, and Implementation of a Contingency Plan capable of dealing with strikes and labor unrest should either occur.

Additionally, all guards shall successfully complete an approved training program of instruction before being allowed to perform guard services.  The basic training program shall consist of 70 hours of training and this requirement does not apply to guards who have previously successfully completed the training.

Contractor employees assigned to certain guard posts must be able to converse in English with employees and visitors.  The English language requirement will be specified by guard post and the Levels of language speaking proficiency will be defined in Exhibit H of the solicitation.  The COR may interview guard(s) to verify specified language capability level as part of the approval process or at any time when an individual is standing duty.

All Contractor employees shall be able to read and understand printed instructions, maps and orders in the predominant local language.  In addition Contractor employees must demonstrate the ability to carry out instructions in the predominant local language.  All employees shall have a Speaking Level 1 - Elementary Proficiency level of the predominant local language of the geographic area where they are assigned for duty.  At a minimum, the Contractor shall maintain one individual capable of conversing in English Level III when the Embassy or Consulate is open to the public.  The predominant local language of U.S. Mission France is French.

The Government plans to post the solicitation on this site on or about April 20, 2010. No paper copies will be mailed to prospective offerors. All announcements and amendments made to this solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps.

The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days.  Once the solicitation announcement closes on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change, and offerors will be notified of any change(s) through an update to the FedBizOpps posting.

A site visit is tentatively scheduled to be held approximately fifteen (15) days after the solicitation is posted at the American Embassy Paris and some of the other locations as addressed in the solicitation.  A firm date for the each site visit will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted.  Contractors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations for personnel attending the site visits in France. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed to attend the site visit.  Instructions for registering personnel to attend each site visit will be announced in the solicitation.

Contractors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) in writing to Neil M. Kern at KernNM@state.gov within 7 calendar days of the synopsis being posed as well as comply with the instructions for submitting names for attending the site visits. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) <br />Army Mobile Device Application Development Services
<p><br />The U.S. Army Contracting Command National Capital Region Contracting Center (NCRCC) is seeking information for the purpose of obtaining market research only. <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to help the Army better understand current and future market solutions, availability of services, industry best practices, technical characteristics and functionality of information technology (IT) services, tools, and products capable of enhancing and/or extending the Army's efforts to develop a software development contract for mobile device applications. Subsequent to the receipt of responses to this RFI, the Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) may invite select RFI respondents to a technical interchange session to discuss their response with Government representatives. <br />This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition. All information received from this RFI will be used for Market Research purposes only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this RFI nor otherwise reimburse vendors for the preparation of any information submitted or Government use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified regarding the outcome of the information received.<br />1.1. Army PEO EIS Background<br />The Army PEO EIS provides infrastructure and information management systems to the Army, enabling it to achieve victory through total information dominance. PEO EIS develops, acquires and deploys tactical and management information technology systems and products. PEO EIS is a systems acquisition, development and integration center of excellence under the management of four deputy program executive officers, five directorates and numerous project/product managers. PEO EIS develops and fields a wide range of products and services that support the Army and, through its diverse programs, touches every soldier, every day. <br />1.2. Army PEO EIS Mobile Applications Vision<br />The Army recognizes the great benefits that mobile applications can provide to meeting mission objectives, and supporting the war-fighter and the greater Army community. PEO EIS envisions itself as the "one-stop shop" within the Army for providing these secure and scalable mobile application products to the Army community. PEO EIS understands that effectively providing mobile application products to its customers goes beyond simply developing these applications for them.

<p>5. MARKET AND TECHNICAL QUESTIONNAIRE<br />1. In the near-term, PEO EIS intends on acquiring the services listed in Table 1 above through a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). <br />a. Are there any other critical services not mentioned in Table 1 that PEO EIS should consider? <br />b. Do vendors typically provide all of the services listed in Table 1 or is specialization in a specific set of services the more frequent model? PEO EIS anticipates multiple vendors (prime/subcontractor teaming arrangements ) providing services in combination to deliver mobile applications to the customer base. What are the potential issues PEO EIS may face when bringing these vendors together? What are the best practices that PEO EIS should consider to successfully integrate these multiple vendors across the mobile application lifecycle?<br />2. How is industry organized (segmented) to provide mobile application development and support services to its customers? By platform (Windows Mobile, Android, iPhone, etc.)? By service (development, design, support, etc.)? Other?<br />3. Do organizations seeking mobile device application development services typically award separate contracts (or perhaps, functional areas within a single contract) for each platform (Windows Mobile, Android, iPhone, etc.) or do they award a single contract that encompass all platforms? What are the advantages and disadvantages for each option?<br />4. PEO EIS would like to better understand industry practices with respect to how vendors demonstrate innovation and use of commercial best practices when designing, developing, integrating, and supporting mobile applications. Within the realm of mobile application services, how do vendors typically demonstrate innovation and use of commercial best practices? From a process perspective? From a service perspective? From a product perspective?<br />5. What are the emerging technology trends anticipated in the mobile application space that should be considered?<br />6. What commercial best practices and trends are typically considered when developing requirements for an acquisition focused on the services in Table 1?<br />7. What are the unique challenges that organizations such as PEO EIS face when developing mobile applications? What are the mitigating strategies?<br />8. PEO EIS would like to better understand how vendors can ensure success when designing, developing, integrating, and deploying mobile device applications. In what ways do vendors measure performance and success for each of the services listed in Table 1?<br />9. PEO EIS anticipates that its customers will require integration of their mobile applications with "back-end" Army, DoD, civilian, and commercial systems and databases. What are the key considerations and challenges in integrating mobile applications with back-end systems? How would you propose that these challenges be overcome? How can integration be streamlined? <br />10. What are the anticipated challenges vendors may face when trying to meet Army and DoD security requirements? PEO EIS intends to put all vendor-developed mobile applications through a stringent Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) process. What has industry's experience been in executing the documentation responsibility for C&amp;A efforts/packages with actual review and approval residing with the Government? What are the potential challenges that vendors may face when working with PEO EIS and the Army to coordinate and execute the C&amp;A process? How would you propose that these challenges be overcome?<br />11. What are the primary risks to data security at, and to/from, the device? What mitigation actions, either in the contract or in parallel, and considerations should be undertaken that will maximize PEO EIS' ability to ensure data security?<br />12. PEO EIS intends to manage its own application store in the near-term; however, it is also interested in understanding the best practices employed by commercial industry in developing and managing application stores. What are the commercial best practices in developing and managing application stores?<br />13. PEO EIS intends to host all provider-developed mobile applications in-house. What are the considerations and challenges associated with moving applications from the provider's development and testing environment to a secure PEO EIS hosting environment? How would you propose that these challenges be overcome?<br />14. PEO EIS intends to provide Tier 0/1 support for all provider-developed mobile applications through the Army Enterprise Service Desk (AESD) and expects providers to supply Tier 2/3 support. What role should providers play in helping maximize the performance of the AESD Tier 0/1 support? How can the interaction between the AESD and the provider be optimized? How should the provider-supplied Tier 2/3 support be integrated with the AESD Tier 0/1 support to ensure the most effective and efficient provisioning of application support?<br />15. What are the challenges and complexities associated with porting applications from one platform to another (e.g., Windows Mobile to iPhone; Android to Blackberry, etc)? How would you propose that these challenges be overcome? In what situations will porting applications be more difficult? Less difficult?<br />16. PEO EIS would like to better understand industry practices for deploying chargeback mechanisms to users of mobile device applications. How do organizations typically deploy chargeback mechanisms to users of mobile device applications? <br />17. PEO EIS has described its high-level vision for delivering mobile applications. Please provide your feedback on the stated vision and approach.

Further, the USCG is not, at this time, seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this Sources Sought. All costs associated with responding to this Sources Sought will be solely at the respondents' expense. At this time, proprietary information is not being requested, and respondents shall refrain from providing proprietary information when responding to this Sources Sought. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Not responding to this Sources Sought does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this Sources Sought.

<DESC>Fort Bliss is holding our first Advance Planning Briefing Industry Day to be held at the Centennial Banquet and Conference Center, East Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas on 14 October 2010.  The Industry Day is sponsored by the Fort Bliss Installation Commanding General in cooperation with the Base Transformation Office, Mission Support Element, Directorates on Fort Bliss, the Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Fort Bliss, and the MICC Office of Small Business Programs.  Fort Bliss will host this Advanced Planning Briefing for Industry (APBI) for interested parties from 7:30am  5:30pm MST.  Registration starts at 7:30am.<BR><BR>At this briefing, participants will receive a series of presentations by Government representatives outlining the Fort Bliss mission and vision, how Fort Bliss is expanding and changing, the MICC organization and overall contracting process, what organizations exist and operate within Fort Bliss and what their FY11/FY12 contract opportunities are/may be so that local and national businesses can learn what potential opportunities will be available for competition.  The conference will also allow other Fort Bliss tenant organizations such Network Enterprise Command (NEC), Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR), Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), Defense Commissary Agency (DECA), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), William Beaumont Army Medical Center (WBAMC) to address those contracting opportunities that they may have coming available in FY11/FY12.  These will be addressed in separate breakout sessions headed by the individual organization.<BR><BR>Due to time constraints, after each presentation, only a limited number of questions will be answered.  Therefore, we request participants that have questions that were not answered during the presentations to provide their written questions via email to daniel.n.portillo@us.army.mil.  All of the presentation briefings will be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov on October 15, 2010.  Answers to questions received that were not answered during the presentations, will be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov at a later date once all questions have been received/answered. <BR><BR>The APBI will be unclassified and open to all interested contractors, large and small businesses, and universities.  Dress code is business casual.  Please email daniel.n.portillo@us.army.mil: Company Name and Address; Name and Contact Information for Each Attendee.  Registration is required for all attendees.  Attendance is free of charge.  However, if attendees want to participate in the luncheon, a luncheon fee will be required and a luncheon ticket will be issued at the registration table on the day of the event.  Attendees wishing to set up a table to market their goods or services may do so on a first come first serve basis.  Spaces are to be reserved by contacting Daniel.N.Portillo@us.army.mil.  Networking will be allowed during breaks and lunch if you choose to do so.<BR><BR>All attendees must meet the requirements for admission to Fort Bliss, to include: proper identification (i.e.: U.S. Driver's License, U.S. Passport, and/or Common Access Card (CAC), and your current vehicle registration or rental car agreement, and proof of motor vehicle insurance  must have all 3 items).  All interested parties will enter through East Biggs Main Gate on Sargent Majors Blvd.  Visitors attending the conference without a Department of Defense (DoD) registration sticker on their vehicle must stop at the vehicle pass office located to the right of the gate.  Expect extremely long delays as there will be a number of personnel requiring passes, in addition to the normal daily gate traffic by Fort Bliss employees.  Therefore you must plan accordingly as the conference will start on time.  Fort Bliss may implement a pre-registration vehicle pass procedure, however due to the short timeframe between this posting and the conference, do not assume that this process will be implemented right away.  Watch for possible amendments to this announcement.<BR><BR>Point of Contact: Primary: Daniel Portillo 915-568-2917 or Daniel.N.Portillo@us.army.mil.  Alternate: Michael R.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Introduction:  As required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.303-2, this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) is prepared to document the facts and rationale justifying the authority cited in Paragraph 4 to negotiate with a sole offeror for the above requirement.  This JOTFOC follows the format and contains all the information required under FAR 6.303-2.
1.  Identification of Agency, Contracting Activity and Document.
Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Acquisitions and Assistance Management Office, LC-10000.Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.Justification for Use of Existing IDIQ Contract as Acquisition Vehicle.
2.  Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  
The requirement involves the complete rehabilitation of the existing spare turbine guide bearing (TGB) located at Parker Powerplant - Parker-Davis Project, Arizona-California.
Due to the unusual and compelling urgency of this requirement, competition will be limited to the Bearing IDIQ Contract holders, all of which have already been determined to be capable and qualified under the Bearing IDIQ solicitation:
Contract No. 07-CP-30-8081 - PME Babbitt Bearing, Minden, NV; Contract No. 07-CP-30-8095 - Precision Machine and Supply, Lewiston, ID;Contract No. 07-CP-30-8096 - Pioneer Motor Bearing, Kings Mountain, NC;Contract No. 07-CC-30-8097 - Kingsbury, Inc., Hatboro, PA
The CO will transmit an Request for Quote (RFQ) to each IDIQ contractor requesting response including firm fixed lump sum price and delivery schedule in one (1) business day.
3.  Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet Agency's Need
The Government requires that the Parker Powerplant spare turbine guide bearing be shipped to the bearing shop, inspected, prepared, re-babbitted, final-machined, and delivered back to Parker Powerplant as soon as practicable and in accordance with the Statement of Work and S. Morgan Smith (original equipment manufacturer) drawings Nos. 1123-GN-1 and 1123-GW-1, attached to the RFQ.
4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
The statutory authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is as follows: .[check the applicable FAR 6.302  authority.]
[  ]	FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1)).
[X] FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(2)). (This justification may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.)
[  ]	FAR 6.302-3  Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(3) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(3)).
[  ]	FAR 6.302-4  International agreement (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(4) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(4)).
[  ]	FAR 6.302-6  National security (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(6) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(6)).
[  ]	FAR 6.302-7  Public interest (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(7) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(7)). (Requires approval of head of the executive agency.)
5.  Background of Requirement and Justification for Use of "Unusual and Compelling Urgency" Authority.
After the rehabilitation of the final turbine-geneator unit (Unit No. 4) under Schedule E of contract   No. 04-CC-30-0107, Unit No. 4 was re-commissioned and returned to commercial service on May 6, 2010.  Just after midnight on the morning of September 14, 2010, as the Hoover control center was transitioning the operation of the unit from generation mode to synchronous condense mode, the turbine guide bearing (TGB) temperature alarm activated, the TGB temperature continued to rise, the geneator field breaker tripped, and the unit shut down and locked out automatically.
Parker personnel tested the oil in the TGB oil sump, and found bearing babbitt in the oil, indicating that the bearing had been "wiped".  The contractor, American Hydro Corporation, was notified of the TGB failure on September 14, 2010.  The contractor's superintendent arrived at the job site on September 20, 2010; and the subcontractor millwright crew arrived at the plant on September 21, 2010.  The contractor dis-assembled the TGB on September 21-22, and advised the Government that the bearing was salvageable and could be repaired by hand-scraping at the plant.  The contractor then began cleaning and scraping the wiped babbitt in the TGB on or about September 22, 2010.
The scraping work continued on September 23-24 with results that were apparently satisfactory to the contractor.  However, on Saturday, September 25, 2010, the contractor's efforts to salvage the TGB failed when a large flake (about 2.5 inches square and about -inch thick) was dislodged from the surrounding and underlying babbitt.  Based on the contractor's assessment, this rendered the bearing unsalvageable.  Accordingly, on September 26, 2010, the contractor, using equipment borrowed from the Government with the approval of the Parker Dam Manager and the COR, removed the failed TGB from the turbine pit for shipment to its shop in York, PA, and presumably on to its bearing shop, American Babbitt Bearing in Huntington, WV.
The contractor's transportation company picked up the failed TGB from the plant on the afternoon of September 27, 2010.  The Government has requested from the contractor, but has not yet received, information regarding the contractor's plan and schedule for evaluation, appropriate repair or re-babbitting of the bearing, and delivery of the bearing back to the powerplant for re-installation in the machine. Therefore, the timeframe required for the contractor to repair the TGB and to then prepare Unit No. 4 for return to commercial operation is completely unknown at this time.
Due to the failure of the Parker Unit No. 4 TGB on September 14, 2010; the resulting forced outage of Parker Unit No. 4; the failure on Saturday, September 25, 2010, of American Hydro Corp.'s efforts to salvage the bearing; and the indeterminate and possibly lengthy timeframe involved in American Hydro's repairs to the failed bearing; it is considered to the in the best interest of the Government to proceed, in parallel with American Hydro's work, with the rehabilitation of the Parker Powerplant spare TGB.  Even though the Bearing IDIQ contracts are limited to Hoover, the unusual and compelling urgency of the requirement justifies the use of the exising IDIQ contract(s) and the limitation of competition to the existing Bearing IDIQ contract holders.
The unusual and compelling urgency of the requirement to rehabilitate the spare TGB arises from the forced outage resulting from the failure of the Unit No. 4 TGB; the associated negative effect upon the GPRA performance of Parker Powerplant and the Lower Colorado Dams Office; the resulting loss of unit availability revenue; the resulting loss of power generation revenue; and the additional loss of power generation revenue caused by the re-scheduling of water deliveries downstream.  These contractor-caused negative effects can potentially be mitigated by the timely rehabilitation and return to the powerplant of the spare turbine guide bearing.
6.  Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications/Nature of Acquisition Requiring Use of Cited Authority.
Due to the unusual and compelling urgency of this requirement, competition will only be limited to the four (4) Bearing IDIQ Contract holders listed in item No. 2 above, all of which have already been determined to be capable and qualified under the Bearing IDIQ solicitation.
7.  Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Possible. 
See item No. 6 above.
Pursuant to FAR 5.101(a), a synopsis notice of the contract action will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website within 30 days of contract award per 6.305 (b).  7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price.
Fair and reasonable price will be determined by price analysis based on the IGCE. 
8.  Market Survey.
Not applicable due to unusual and compelling urgency of the requirement and the fact that each of the four (4) Bearing IDIQ Contract holders listed in item No. 2 above has already been determined to be capable and qualified under the Bearing IDIQ solicitation.
9.  Additional Supporting Facts for Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.
Supporting facts are outlined in item No. 5 above.
10.  Listing of Sources Expressing Interest in Acquisition.   
See item numbers 2,5 and 6 above. RFQ's will be sent to the Bearing IDIQ holders as noted above. 
11.  Action Taken to Remove and Overcome Barriers to Competition.
Competition is anticipated to be adequate even considering the unusual and compelling urgency of this requirement.  Competition will only be limited to the four (4) Bearing IDIQ Contract holders listed in item No. 2 above, all of which have already been determined to be capable and qualified under the Bearing IDIQ solicitation.  12.  Approvals.  The supporting data, which is the responsibility of the Bureau of Reclamation technical personnel and forms basis for this justification, have been certified as complete and accurate by means of the below signature on this document.  As required by FAR 6.303-2(a)(12) and 6.304(1), (a) the contracting officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief and (b) the signatures demonstrate the certifications and approvals necessary for this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 5,730 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease at 3098 Cliff Gookin Blvd, Tupelo, Mississippi. The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location. The delineated area is bounded as follows: <br />North by McCullough Blvd<br />East by Thomas Street/Natchez Trace<br />South by Cliff Gookin Blvd<br />West by Coley Road/Cliff Gookin Blvd<br />Other applicable requirements include:<br />- Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)<br />- Parking - on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessor's control<br />The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Mission Support Division, Norfolk, VA is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Clewes Technical Service for the following requirement: Provide voltage regulator and switchboard modifications on the NOAA RONALD H. BROWN. The period of performance shall be January 17, 2011 through February 11, 2011. Work is to be preformed at 1050 Register Street, North Charleston, SC 29405. The statutory authority is 41 US 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. Part of the modification was accomplished&nbsp;last year by Clewes Technical Service but&nbsp;due to the continuing failure of the&nbsp;voltage regulators it is now necessary to complete the upgrade modification. A portion of the required modifications is covered under existing warranty. No other entity can provide the necessary warranty repairs required. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). The applicable NAICS code is 336611. Interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses shall be submitted by 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, October 19, 2010. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov. <br /><br />
<p>Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>The NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN currently has voltage regulators that are unreliable and obsolete. The two sister ships (Atlantis and Revelle) have accomplished a modification to upgrade the voltage regulator systems to a modern digital system that is supportable accomplished by Clewes Technical Services. Clewes Technical Services has already accomplished part of this upgrade modification on the NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN. It is now necessary to complete this upgrade modification due to the continuing failure of the existing older style voltage regulators. The ship's inventory of spares for this obsolete system is critically low, therefore it is critical that this modification be completed.</p>
<p>It is in the Government's best interest to have Clewes Technical Services finish the modification that this company has already started on the NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN. Clewes has already successfully accomplished this modification on two sister ships to the satisfaction of the American Bureau of Shipping. Any warranty or performance issues with this system would put the Government at a severe disadvantage if another contractor were to attempt to finish this modification.</p>
<p>Clewes Technical Services has worked to correct, maintain, and upgrade the switchboards on the AGOR class vessels RONALD H. BROWN, ATLANTIS, and REVELLE. Many problems, such as incorrect drawings, faulty components, and substandard assembly procedures have plagued these vessels since delivery. Clewes Technical Services is the only company with the in-depth knowledge on these switchboards and has in house hard to find components.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL
This sources sought notice is issued in an effort to conduct additional market research for information and planning purposes. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to provide an electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) solution through a secure network for the VA Health Administration Center's (HAC) Meds by Mail (MbM) Program. MbM is designed to provide comprehensive outpatient mail pharmacy services to qualifying beneficiaries of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). There are two MbM servicing centers; one located in Dublin, Georgia and the other in Cheyenne, Wyoming. MbM processes over 2 million prescriptions annually for eligible CHAMPVA beneficiaries located throughout the country.

 The requirements for the services are listed below:

1. The solution will allow (non-VA) providers located throughout the country with certified e-prescribing software and capability to electronically send prescription information to the MbM pharmacies via a secure network.  The output of the data transmission should be compatible with standard fax hardware and software to allow for immediate receipt of electronic prescription data from providers.

Establish a strategic and supporting operational technology plan that supports the NAS's short-term and long-term objectives.<br />3. Establish appropriate advisory and governance mechanisms to ensure productive interaction among constituents and customers. These mechanisms could include establishing formal advisory mechanisms.<br />4. Influence and build alliances with IT entities and resources that fall outside his/her direct authority to ensure IT resources available to projects that NAS may elect to support are optimized to manage the execution of major information systems projects, as well as to ensure a competitive and efficient cost structure. <br />5.

The work may require the incumbent to establish new concepts or programs and considerable effort to resolve previously unyielding problems. <br />5. Scope and Effectiveness: The DPCIT performs a broad range of tasks related to a complex foreign assistance program in Mexico. NAS programs have a significant impact on embassy operations including those of other USG agencies. An essential part of the complexity will be the identification of the project parameters with the GOM counterpart(s) and the subsequent negotiation of goals. <br />6. Personal Contacts: The incumbent works closely with personnel of NAS, Embassy Management Section, other USG LEA agencies in the mission, contractors implementing NAS projects and GOM counterparts.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:<br />Factor 1. Past Performance: An evaluation of applicant's ability to perform under the contract based on past performance. In conducting the evaluation, the Government reserves the right to utilize all evaluation information available at the time of evaluation, whether provided by the applicant or obtained from other sources. <br />(20 points)</p>

<p>Factor 7. Communication: Demonstrated ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing. (10 points)</p>
<p>2. COMPENSATION</p>
<p>Compensation for the position will be negotiated as follows: Level of experience will dictate the salary level within the grade range. Entry-level salary will normally be at the first step of the grade range for the position. However, consideration will be given to the successful applicant's experience that is specifically relevant to the position to be filled. Number of years of relevant experience will determine at what step within the grade range the successful applicant will be compensated.</p>

<p>EVALUATION FACTORS AND BASIS FOR AWARD:</p>
<p>1) Quote Evaluation</p>
<p>Quotes submitted in response to this RFQ will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor A - CAPABILITY: The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror's proposed facility meets or exceeds ICE requirements as described on Attachment B - Wellness/Fitness/Health Club Membership Support Services.</p>
<p>Acceptable: Meet or exceeds ICE requirements as described on Attachment B - Wellness/Fitness/Health Club Membership Support Services.</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Does not meet ICE requirements described on Attachment B - Wellness/Fitness/Health Club Membership Support Services.</p>
<p>Factor B - PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance on current contracts of a similar size, scope and complexity, as proven by the successful management of current and previous contracts of a similar scope, magnitude, and complexity during the last three (3) years from the date of this solicitation. In performing this evaluation, the Government will consider the Offeror's past performance information provided by the Offeror (up to 3 references), the feedback from the past performance questionnaires, and may consider information obtained from other sources. If there is no relevant past performance information, past performance will be rated as neutral.</p>
<p>Acceptable: Past performance is applicable in terms of size, scope, and complexity and at least good in quality. The Offeror's record of past performance indicates there is very little risk associated with receiving quality services and contract performance. The feedback from the past performance questionnaires and the Offeror's experience indicate that the Offeror will meet or exceed the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Past performance may be limited in applicability in terms of size, scope, and complexity and at least marginal in quality. The Offeror's record of past performance indicates there are significant risks associated with receiving quality services and contract performance. The past performance questionnaires and the Offeror's experience indicate lack of customer satisfaction and the Offeror's experiences indicate the likelihood of several major problems during performance of the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Neutral: No past performance available for evaluation. Offeror has asserted that it has no directly related or similar relevant past performance experience. Quote receives no merit or demerit for this factor.</p>
<p>Factor C - PRICE: The Price Quote (Attachment A) will be evaluated for accuracy, completeness, and reasonableness in accordance with FAR Part 15.404-1(b), Price Analysis and will not be assigned an adjectival rating. For award purposes, the Government will evaluate the prices for the base period as well as all options. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>2) Basis for Award</p>
<p>The evaluation shall be conducted in a lowest price technically acceptable manner. Each technical factor will be evaluated as "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must be rated "Acceptable" (or "Neutral" for the Past Performance factor) in each of the areas identified by the following technical evaluation factors:</p>
<p>a. Capability<br />b. Past Performance</p>
<p>There will be no trade-offs. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>After a quote has been determined technically acceptable, price becomes the most important factor.</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
<p>Online Protected Species Workshop: Hosting Services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Regional Office, Sustainable Fisheries Division (SFD) administers protected species workshops (PSW) for owners and captains of western Pacific pelagic longline vessels. The workshops are mandatory, and a valid workshop certificate is necessary for an owner to renew a longline fishing permit. The workshop training includes protected species identification, handling and release techniques, and regulatory requirements. The workshop is required annually, and each year about 200 fishermen and vessel owners are trained in Hawaii, and 100 are trained in American Samoa. Staff from SFD conducts the workshops. Online training is offered as an alternative to classroom training sessions. The existing online courseware covers the same topics as the classroom sessions. Online learners are tested, and after successful completion of the course modules and tests, they are issued a PSW certificate. The online system also houses a database for administrative and tracking purposes. The online course contains approximately 140 screens, plus the test section. The average learner takes from two to four (2 to 4) seat-hours to complete the course. The course is Adobe Flash-based SCORM 2004 compliant.</p>
<p>NEED FOR WORK AND CONTRACTOR'S CAPABILITY</p>
<p>SFD requires the services of a Learning Management System (LMS) provider to host the online course for a period of one year, with possible extensions up to a total of three years. The course must be available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year without interruption. Any deviation from this commitment must be agreed to in advance. To achieve this task, the Contractor must have knowledge, expertise, and experience in hosting SCORM 2004 courses.</p>
<p>PROJECT TASKS, DELIVERABLES, AND MONITORING</p>
<p>The Contractor will be SCORM 2004 Certified. The Contractor will be solely responsible for importing the legacy SCORM 2004 compliant course into the LMS platform, to include any programmatic or other alterations that may be necessary. The Contractor will explain how it manages the registration and delivery of online training for users, how it updates new version deployments, automates the administration, tracking, and reporting of training conducted, and how it sends data from client to server.</p>
<p>The Contractor will explain in detail how existing user and training records on the current LMS host will be migrated to the Contractor's system, including the communications plan between the Contractor's and the current LMS host' technical teams. The Contractor will be responsible for any and all costs pertaining to communications and tasks between the legacy hosting vendor and the Contractor. The data migration plan will include the mapping of data entity and elements, the approach to content and customer migration, i.e., manual, automated, or mixed, and any significant risks in data migration include the loss of data.</p>
<p>The Contractor will demonstrate its financial capability and stability by providing a brief corporate history and any other applicable supporting information. The Contractor will describe its customer support philosophy and commitments to high quality services to SFD.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be able to demonstrate the ability to provide the required services by providing at least three references of current customers for which similar hosting services are being provided, including dates of service, brief description of products and services, number of online learners, institution name, and point of contact information. The Contractor will demonstrate their experience by providing live links to actual or demonstration systems that indicate the vendor's capabilities to deliver the required hosting service.</p>
<p>The Contractor will specify the proposed costs separately for year 1, and additional costs for possible additional years 2 and 3.</p>
<p>The Contractor's performance will be monitored and evaluated by SFD.</p>
<p>The successful proposal will be selected based on the following criteria and relative importance:<br />1. Technical proposal, no more than 10 pages, that describes how the Contractor would successfully complete the project (15%);<br />2. Documented successful past work performance related to hosting online courses for NOAA Fisheries Service (50%);<br />3. Documented successful past work performance related to hosting online courses for other U.S. government agencies (25%); and<br />4. Price (10%).</p>
<p>SCHEDULE OF WORK</p>
<p>SFD will provide the Contractor with deadlines for all tasks as mutually agreed to with the Contractor. Deadlines are subject to change. Completion of the services and deliverables for specific tasks is contingent on SFD providing information to the Contractor in a timely manner. Delay in receipt of such information may cause unavoidable delays in deliverables under this Contract. Adjustments in work schedule and project tasks may be made by mutual consent.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT-SUPPLIED MATERIALS</p>
<p>During the course of this work, the Contractor shall have access to Government products or data that are relevant to this project, as required and approved by NMFS. Any information that has not been published that is received from the Government in connection with this Contract, or furnished to the Contractor from other sources in response to the Government's requirements under this Contract, will be restricted to this project, and may not be disclosed or used for any other purpose without the prior written approval of SFD. The restrictions do not apply to information which:<br />1. Currently or subsequently enters the public domain;<br />2. Has been released to any third party, without restrictions; or<br />3.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Description:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the design and construction of a new federal office building in Miramar, Florida. The new federal office building and related facilities will consist of approximately 475,000 gross square feet of usable space and will house a single federal agency.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">GSA allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs of new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions. The art budget for the Miramar federal office building project is currently estimated to be $750,000. One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry). The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions. Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"><span>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the new federal office building in Miramar, Florida, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on November 3, 2010. Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for the Miramar project, but will be considered for future GSA commissions alongside all other artists on the Registry. Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis. Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a statement that he or she can perform the work associated with the GSA commission within the identified budget. GSA will count the combined weight of all the selection criteria as significantly more important than price.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>_X_ Addendum to 52.212-2   (LP 5005)  <BR><BR>Paragraph (a) is hereby supplemented with the following:<BR><BR>Factor 1.  Technical  <BR><BR><BR>Technical Merit.  Technical merit ratings reflect the Governments confidence in each offerors ability, as demonstrated in its proposal, to perform the requirements stated in the solicitation.  In evaluating the proposal risk, the Government will make an independent judgment of the probability of success, the impact of failure and the alternatives available to meet the requirements.<BR><BR>The following adjectival ratings will be used in evaluating each offerors technical proposal<BR><BR>Acceptable To receive this rating, the offeror shall present a proposal that clearly and comprehensively addresses the technical factor.  The offeror shall provide sufficient details for the Government to determine whether the proposal satisfactorily meets the minimum requirements of the Performance Work Statement and this solicitation.  The proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is capable of performing the requirement for the total proposed price indicated in its proposal<BR><BR>Unacceptable  This rating will be assessed on any offeror that presents a proposal that demonstrates any of the following:<BR><BR>(f) 	Fails to clearly and comprehensively the technical evaluation factors or submit a technical plan.<BR><BR>(g) 	Fails to provide sufficient detail for the Government to determine whether the proposal satisfactorily meets the minimum requirements of the Performance Work Statement and this solicitation in addressing the factors and subfactors.<BR><BR>(h) 	Fails to clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is technically capable to perform the requirements at its total proposed price.<BR><BR><BR>Factor 1.  Price<BR><BR> Price will be evaluated separately from the past performance and technical factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability in terms of:<BR><BR>A.  That the prices are consistent with and reflect the proposed requirement.<BR><BR>B.  Offerors are cautioned that an unrealistically low price, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating the quote on the basis that the offeror has made an imprudent offer.<BR><BR>Factor 2.  Past and Present Performance.   Performance Risk analysis provides insight into an offeror's probability of successfully completing the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's performance record on recent, relevant, and similar contract efforts.  The number and severity of problems (if any), the demonstrated effectiveness of corrective actions taken (if required) and the overall performance record are to be taken into consideration.    The offerors performance will be rated in terms of performance risk.  A performance risk rating (low, medium, high or neutral) will be assigned dependent upon the evaluators' assessment of the level of confidence in the offeror's performance record.  In ranking offerors assessed in the same performance risk category, an offeror with experience in performing services will be ranked as a lower risk compared to an offeror with no or hardly any experience in performing services.  Past Performance will be evaluated on performance under current and prior contracts for the last three years.  The information which will be used for evaluation will be obtained from those presented in the Offeror's past performance documentation, the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/cparsmain.htm, and any other Government sources. The Government may reject a proposal if it is found that any information that has a negative impact on the offeror's past performance record has been deleted, misrepresented, or withheld.  The following risk ratings will be used to evaluate past and present performance:<BR><BR>-High Risk - Significant doubt exists that the offeror will satisfactorily perform the services on solicitation, based on preponderance of unsatisfactory performance records under the various factor evaluations, or offerors record of unsuccessful past and current contracts performance in fulfilling requirements similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offerors have consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, have defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or have chronically failed to meet contract terms.<BR><BR>-Medium Risk - Some doubt exists based on instances of record of poor performance, especially in contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.<BR><BR>-Low Risk - Little doubt exists, based on the offeror's preponderance of good, if not excellent past and current records of contract performance, especially in large contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. <BR><BR>Neutral Risk  No relevant past performance information.<BR><BR>Note:  Any offeror that receives a rating of high risk in past and present performance and unacceptable in technical will not be considered for award.<BR><BR>_X_ 52.212-3 -- OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2009) ALTERNATE I (APR 2002)<BR><BR>SPECIAL NOTE: All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award, and lack of registration shall make an offer ineligible for award.

<p><br />U.S. COAST GUARD<br />HU-25 AUXILIARY POWER UNIT REPAIR<br />STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates thirteen (13) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel. These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments. The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) model GTCP36-100C is a gas turbine engine, which is essentially a self-contained power source providing pneumatic and rotational shaft power. The APU provides AC/DC electrical power for the HU-25 aircraft systems prior to engine start or during selected emergency procedures. It also provides a pneumatic source for the operation of environmental systems during ground operations. APU's and their subcomponents are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard's Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). This tracking provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, and item location and status. It also provides an effective method of configuration control. History has shown the APU to be highly reliable, with the exception of internal oil seals leaking oil in to the gas path. Otherwise, little more is required than scheduled maintenance and inspections. The APU requires repair following: 2700 airframe operating hours, Foreign Object Damage (FOD), internal oil leaks, or mechanical failure beyond the scope of normal line maintenance.</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The Coast Guards objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to repair and provide complete, ready-to-install GTCP36-100C APU's for the HU-25 that are certified for flight with an FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document. A Certificate of Conformance (COC) may be substituted for the FAA 8130-3 only if the COC is deemed acceptable by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard desires a Turn-Around-Time of no greater than 180 days from time of material receipt at contractor's facility to prevent Aircraft On Ground (AOG) supply issues.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A. Repaired APU's must comply with the current Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) specifications, drawings, Service Bulletins, and performance requirements as set forth in the OEM technical specifications. The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform the services requested. This includes, but is not limited to; required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, serviceable and non-serviceable parts storage, preservation, packaging, shipping, etc, to repair GTCP36-100C APU's. Packaging and preservation shall be in accordance with (IAW) maintenance manual GTCP36-100C chapter 49-20-00, Engine Servicing, step 2, dated 03 Sept. 1985.</p>
<p>The offeror's responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component. Configuration of the APU must be maintained by ensuring that all OEM Service Bulletins remain incorporated.</p>
<p>Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract. The Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) MRS Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.</p>
<p>B. To meet the Coast Guard's objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Technical</p>
<p>a. Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, fixtures and parts to meet current OEM specifications as referenced in paragraph 3.0.A.<br />b. Provide a written Performance Metrics Plan.<br />c. Provide evidence of, and ability to maintain, a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance</p>
<p>a. Provide documentation of having performed repair of similar or like items.<br />Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references' name, company, phone number, and e-mail address. <br /><br />4.0 Service Bulletins: <br />All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer. The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins. Upon receipt of an APU requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below. Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supercede the previous configuration. In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract. The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component. The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups. The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated. Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated. When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract. The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.<br />5.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS: The following Technical Specifications are applicable:<br />GTCP36-100C chapter 49-20-00, Engine Servicing, step 2., dated 03 Sept. 1985.<br />6.0 Government Furnished Property:<br />One (1) APU Harness, P/N 3888080 will be provided to contractor for testing of APU's.<br />7.0 Data availability:<br />7.1.1 OEM Technical data, Service Bulletins, drawings and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the U.S. Coast guard.<br />The GFP will be returned to the Coast Guard in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition should the contract be terminated, cancelled, or expire.</p>
<p>The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Provisions and Clauses Apply:<br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. (June 2008) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />Evaluation Factors: The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution. The best value for the Coast Guard may merit a higher price based on technical superiority. Using sound business judgment, the government will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal's relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical/Management Solution/Approach<br />Factor 2 - Performance Measures and Metrics<br />Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />Factor 4 - Cost/Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3. While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor. Cost/price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation rating for technical factors approach equal.</p>
<p>DETAILED FACTORS</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Management/Solution/Approach</p>
<p>The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor's solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of auxiliary power unit (APU) and component part refurbishment (repair). The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused. Evidence of the quality of the technical management /solution/approach includes:</p>
<p>(a) A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be implemented to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.</p>
<p>(b) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.</p>
<p>(c) A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes. The management approach needs to provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.<br />&bull; Clear lines of communication between the Contractor's team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.<br />&bull; Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor's validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance. i.e. ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service bulletins, FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness Document or COC.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Performance Measures and Metrics</p>
<p>The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:</p>
<p>(a) Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives.<br />(b) Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness<br />(c) Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor's past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction. The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the quotation.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor's actual performance on repair of similar or like items. This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Cost/Price</p>
<p>Each Contractor's cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:</p>
<p>(a) Evaluation of proposed price/cost.</p>
<p>(b) Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>(c) Realism: If applicable, a realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, material kinds and quantity for reach identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the contractor's proposed cost/price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor's technical proposal.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<RESPDATE>101510
<CONTACT>Christopher C. Lende, CPT, Phone 3188316437, Email christopher.c.lende@afghan.swa.army.mil
<DESC>Additional Clarifications:<br /><br />6. Can you provide us with an accurate grid of the location?
<p>- FOB Shinwar is roughly 30 miles SE of Jalalabad, located very near the village of Shinwar, Nangahar Province Afghanistan. The directions to FOB Shinwar from Jalalabad are:<br /><br />Travel East on Jalalabad HWY 1A. At the road circle (there is an airplane / traffic Tower / Afghan Flag in the center of the circle), turn RIGHT towards Marco Bazaar until you reach a canal bridge (Hospital Bridge). Turn RIGHT after the bridge on the paved road. Follow this road until you see a hill on your left (it will have a TV antenna and an ABP outpost on it.), do not turn just pass this hill you will see the District Center and the Shinwar ruins on the right. This is near the project area.</p>
<p>7. Please can you clarify more about the requirement to conduct foot patrols around the perimeter of the FOB. This seems to contradict the point made earlier in the RFP that the ASG is on site purely as a defensive force. What US Military support would our personnel receive if they were to be conducting such "missions" up to 1km away from the safety of the FOB?</p>
<p>- This requirement is for a "Show of Force" foot patral around the perimeter of the FOB. It is anticipated this foot patrol will be 100 to 200 meters from the perimeter wall depending on terrain. It will be up to the FOB Commander whether US Military takes part in the ASG foot patrols around the FOB perimeter.</p>
<p>8. The number of guard posts/ECPs is listed in the solicitation but not the exact number of guards and supervisors. Can you please confirm how many guards and supervisors you require or let us know how many you require on duty at any one time on each post?<br />- It is up to the contractor to determine how many guards are required to effectively meet the security requirements of the Statement of Work and explain their security plan in their proposal.</p>
<p>9. Do you have a preference for nationality of the Site Manager? Should they be US National, other international or would you prefer Afghan? And do they require any form of security clearance (US, NATO or other)?<br />- Answered in clarification #4 on www.fob.gov</p>
<p>10. Do you intend the guards to remain on-site when not on shift or will they be able to return to their homes between shifts? <br />- Guards are to remain on-site when not on shift.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to solicitation number SB1341-10-RQ-0796 is to provide responses to questions that have posed by potential offerors. Below is a list of the questions with the official responses from NIST:
<p>Q1: In the deliverables that refer to designs like the deliverable number 8:<br />- Does the end user ask for a domain model as well as the outlined architecture of the system that would support this domain model? <br />- Response: Yes, a detailed plan of how the software modules will interact with each other is expected in the offeror's response.</p>
<p>Q2: In the deliverables that refer to the implementation like the deliverable number 7: Does the end user ask for the migration of the current data from the current to the new system and the implementation of the new system (core and full user interface)?<br />Response: Yes.</p>
<p>Q3: Does the end user want the system to be able to:<br />- Automatically retrieve if possible bibliographic data from the internet?<br />- Automatically retrieve if possible chemical system information from know NIST databases?<br />- Automatically retrieve if possible physical property information for a single component from know NIST databases?<br />- Automatically retrieve if possible chemical property information for a single component from know NIST databases? <br />Response: This is beyond the scope of the present requirement; however the system should be designed so that these functions could be developed in the future.<br /><br />Q4: Does the system currently do this automatic retrieval of information? <br />Response: No</p>
<p>Q5: Does the batch import/export apply for bibliographic data only or all type of data? <br />Response: All types of data</p>
<p>Q6: What does "establish a link in semantic web space for the DOI number " mean? <br />Response: Establishment of a link in "semantic web" space is important so that one database and it records can interface with all others. The DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) is a unique identifiers for each journal article, etc.</p>
<p><br />Q7: Do we do most of the testing only at the end of the base period (last 16 weeks)? <br />Response: Not necessarily - testing should be done as needed during the entire project.</p>
<p>Q8: The total number of weeks according to the deliverables is 41 weeks. From what I understood, the deliverables or timeframes are flexible. As long as the COTR agrees to it, is that correct? <br />Response: The period of performance is one year total for this contract. NIST anticipates that some individual time frames will need to be adjusted within this 12-month period.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to solicitation number SB1341-10-RQ-0796 is to amend section VI of the Performance Work Statement that is included in the original SF 1449 attachment, and to attached a Revised SF 1449 to show the changes made.
<p><br />In section VI of the Performance Work Statement, titled Period of Performance and Place of Performance, the last paragraph in this section is to be disregarded by all offerors. This paragraph currently reads as "Contract employees working under this contract shall be paid only for hours actually worked at the hourly rates established in the contract. Payment to the contractor will not be made for temporary work stoppage due to circumstances beyond the control of the agency, such as acts of god, inclement weather, power outages , or temporary closing of facilities."</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a fixed price purchase order. Therefore, the above statement does not apply to this requirement. The newly attached document entitled Revised SF 1449 shows this change. Offerors shall use the Revised SF 1449 to submit quotations.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Technical Capability- Quotes shall address in detail the following information as they will be rated against these criteria. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria.<br />1. Quality Control: The contractor shall provide verification that they possess Quality Control procedures and certifications applicable to the services being requested.<br />2. OEM Procedures: The contractor shall provide verification that they have the capability to repair the assets, have the capability to produce all requested documentation and have the capability to provide technical support.</p>
<p>USCG Evaluation of Technical Capability: Evaluation of vendor's technical capability shall include evaluation by the USCG New Product Development Branch. The evaluation will include in-depth analysis of the vendor's capability to complete the work being solicited to include: facilities, personnel, and associated processes (Quality Control, inventory management, etc.). This evaluation may be accomplished via document reviews and/or a vendor site visit. Vendors must pass this evaluation in order to be further considered for contract award.<br />This evaluation will only be performed on vendors selected for possible contract award. Evaluation will be conducted and completed prior to contract award.<br />Evaluation Criteria: Only offerors successfully meeting the technical evaluation factors listed above will be considered for possible award and evaluated in the following areas. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following criteria in descending order of importance: delivery, past performance (relevant and recent) and price.<br />Delivery is the most important evaluation factor, with Past Performance being the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.<br />Delivery: The offer must include delivery information IAW the attached Statement of Work. Delivery times in days for the repairs for each asset will be evaluated. <br />Past Performance: The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years.

The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. <br />In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.<br />Price: The contractor shall provide pricing based on the unit price of sparing, repair prices, test and evaluation prices, and labor rates for unusual damage, technical support, product improvement/engineering change proposal, service bulletins as requested in the attached quote sheet titled "HSCG38-10-Q-200170 Quote Sheet". The total price evaluation will be for the Base and all four Option periods. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (AUG-2009), <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Anticipated date of award is 31 October 2010.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">SUBJECT: The Air force District of Washington is conducting Market research on behalf of Air Force Medical Support Activity (AFMSA). The&nbsp;govt&nbsp;requests that interested parties provide a capability package with reference to current&nbsp;and /or historical&nbsp;contracts providing the services as outlined in the draft PWS. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />DISCLAIMER: This is not a request for proposals or a request for quotations; it is strictly a Request for Information (RFI) only. Neither, unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. The US Air Force is currnently seeking companies who are currently performing similar duties idetified in the attached PWS. No contract will be awarded pursuant to this RFI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BACKGROUND: Prior to the sequencing of the human genome, physicians and healthcare providers primarily relied on patient and family health history to assess personal disease risks. Recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics have enhanced providers' ability to estimate disease risk factors which allows them to pursue genome informed treatment options, and potentially maintain better health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Access to the entire human DNA sequence has allowed investigators to identify genetic defects and gene polymorphisms associated with disease initiation and progression. This information will enhance the effectiveness of specific treatment regimens by providing prediction of patient drug responsiveness and clinical outcomes as well as likelihood of adverse events and tolerability issues with certain drugs. Pharmacogenomics introduced the concept of using molecular markers (biomarkers) to assess drug efficacy and safety and the risk of disease (or its presence) before the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Patient Centered-Precision Care (PC2) is the Air Force Surgeon General's program to implement genome-informed personalized medicine. PC2 will provide decision support, information, processes, technologies, and systems to promote evidence-based, coordinated, integrated, and customized patient care for Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) beneficiaries. PC2 is divided into two arms; Clinical (PC2-Clincal) and Research (PC2-Z).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PC2-Z will evaluate the impact of providing genomic information on medical outcomes and clinical care provided within AFMS Military Treatment Facilities (MTF); systematically review, evaluate, and summarize medical evidence regarding genomic associations that are clinically actionable for application in clinic setting; and expand the knowledge base of clinically significant genomic associations by researching the correlations between genomic, medical, environmental, and demographic patient information. PC2-Z will develop and enhance existing AFMS information technology systems to capture and analyze genetic information joined with clinical, environmental, and other administrative data to be made available as de-identified data sets for collaboration with academic and federal research partners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">.<br />REQUIREMENTS: See attached draft PWS .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />RESPONSE SUBMISSION AND CONTACT INFORMATION: ELECTRONIC RESPONSES: Electronic responses to this RFI must be addressed to Keith Hunter via e-mail to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keith.hunter.ctr@afncr.af.mil. Responses must be received by this office on or before 8:00 a.m. 4 October 2010. This RFI is not a commercial solicitation. The Government will not pay or any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information.</p>

<DESC>Clarification #1:The RFI lists five databases Federal Agencies must check to verify eligibility.  The RFI also references an effort to coordinate the five databases into a single eligibility database, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS).  It is FMLoB's intention for the vendor community to propose a solution that checks across the five databases listed in the RFI, and to run the check against FAPIIS.
Clarification #2:The government is surveying the market place for sources - this is a new requirement based on the OMB memo referenced in the RFI.  There are no previous awards or incumbents supporting a similar effort for FMLoB.

The major elements of the project include:<br /><br />a. Removal of 27 stoplogs (dive activity)<br />b. Return stoplogs to storage.<br /><br />1.1.2.1 Truck Mounted Crane<br /><br />a. A 30-ton (or less) truck-mounted crane shall be used for removal of stoplogs. During transport, the stoplogs shall be kept parallel to the spillway deck. If a crane is utilized to transport stoplogs, they may be transported perpendicular to the spillway deck if elevated at least 15 feet above deck to clear light stands.<br /><br />b. Only one pair of the cranes outriggers will be able to fully extend. The other pair will need to be kept within 14-0 rail-to-rail width of spillway bridge.<br /><br />c. The Government will supply certified lifting chains for the stoplogs, however they shall be installed by the contractor and shall meet the requirements of drawing S-08. If the contractor chooses, he may provide his own lifting slings in accordance with drawing S-08.<br /><br />d. Crane must be capable of safely lifting 3,800 lb (dry stoplogs), plus weight of cables, hook block, lifting slings and any incidental impact load or friction anticipated by the Contractor. When stoplogs is pulled out of the water, it is possible for the load weight to briefly be 5,800 lbs, which assumes water trapped above the web and between flanges. It is anticipated that the drain holes provided in the stoplogs will allow this water to drain rapidly, lowering the weight back to 3,800 lbs. Lifting radius and boom length during placement can be determined from requirements and dimensions shown on drawings. Lifting radius and boom length required for picking stoplogs off flatbed trailer shall be determined by Contractor.<br /><br /><br />P.O.C.

<a href="mailto:cody.d.cotten@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Fort Worth</a>
<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses, and General Purpose Warehouses located in the state of Georgia.  The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Cody Cotten, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at cody.d.cotten@usace.army.mil .  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Business Process. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but are also the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty one, Fort Worth District (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WT) facilities, Reception Station Barracks, Drill Sergeant Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts for Barracks are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) and Northeast ( CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. The IDIQ contracts for Warehouses are located in East and West of the Mississippi River and have been distributed accordingly.<BR>SCOPE OF WORK: <BR><BR>Central Issue Warehouses:  The primary mission of the CIFs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the specified United States Army Installation.  CIF facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed.  The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.  The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inventory pattern.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.<BR>Support Supply Activity Warehouses: SSAs will provide a facility capable of storing and maintaining the Army prepositioned stocks (APS) and items required for active duty operation.  The facility is similar to a parts wholesale warehouse.  The functional and operational requirements of the SSA require that the design be based on the Adapt-Build Model standard design.    Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will not vary.<BR>General Purpose Warehouses: GPWs will be capable of supporting the storage of various equipment and materials, up to a Moderate-hazard level.  GPW facilities may have substantially differing design and operational requirements in order to meet the Armys needs on a worldwide basis.  The facility type will provide an acceptable relationship between actual equipment dimensions, performance characteristics and the building dimensions.  GPWs are intended to be similar both functionally and technically to private sector industrial warehouses  Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; water, sewer, gas; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements and information systems.  Access for persons with disabilities will be provided in public areas.  Comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services are required.  Comprehensive warehouse pallet and racking systems related to warehouse functional design services are required.  Air conditioning will be provided in administrative areas, and warehouse areas will be ventilated and heated.  Supporting work includes fire protection sprinkler and fire detection systems of the warehouses.  <BR>It is the intent of Government to issue design-build and adapt-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region.<BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   <BR>This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses, and General Purpose Warehouses located West of the Mississippi River (AR, AZ, CA, CO, IA, KS, LA, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, NM, NV, OK, OR, SD, TX, UT, WA, WY).  The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Cody Cotten, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at cody.d.cotten@usace.army.mil .  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Business Process. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but are also the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty one, Fort Worth District (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WT) facilities, Reception Station Barracks, Drill Sergeant Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts for Barracks are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) and Northeast ( CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. The IDIQ contracts for Warehouses are located in East and West of the Mississippi River and have been distributed accordingly.<BR>SCOPE OF WORK: <BR><BR>Central Issue Warehouses:  The primary mission of the CIFs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the specified United States Army Installation.  CIF facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed.  The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.  The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inventory pattern.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.<BR>Support Supply Activity Warehouses: SSAs will provide a facility capable of storing and maintaining the Army prepositioned stocks (APS) and items required for active duty operation.  The facility is similar to a parts wholesale warehouse.  The functional and operational requirements of the SSA require that the design be based on the Adapt-Build Model standard design.    Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will not vary.<BR>General Purpose Warehouses: GPWs will be capable of supporting the storage of various equipment and materials, up to a Moderate-hazard level.  GPW facilities may have substantially differing design and operational requirements in order to meet the Armys needs on a worldwide basis.  The facility type will provide an acceptable relationship between actual equipment dimensions, performance characteristics and the building dimensions.  GPWs are intended to be similar both functionally and technically to private sector industrial warehouses  Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; water, sewer, gas; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements and information systems.  Access for persons with disabilities will be provided in public areas.  Comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services are required.  Comprehensive warehouse pallet and racking systems related to warehouse functional design services are required.  Air conditioning will be provided in administrative areas, and warehouse areas will be ventilated and heated.  Supporting work includes fire protection sprinkler and fire detection systems of the warehouses.  <BR>It is the intent of Government to issue design-build and adapt-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region.<BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   <BR>This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 18 Oct 2010 under solicitation number W9126G-11-R-0053.

<DESC>This requirement is to provide all materials, labor, equipment and transportation necessary to clean, inspect, report condition of two centrifugal compressor rotor components, and reassemble components from two rotors to make one usable rotor. Work shall be accomplished at Contractor's facility. The rotors are currently located at Arnold AFB, TN.<br /><br />The two rotors are Allis-Chalmers (GEOG) model V-1604 centrifugal rotors. One of the rotors has a serial number of 5118 and the other serial number is unknown. The rotors were used in compressors until the early 1970's. At that time they were replaced with new rotors and placed in storage. The rotors are of welded construction and have been covered with a protective coating of Cosmoline. The items have been stored while sitting on the wheels to avoid rotor bow and potential damage to the journals.<br /><br />Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination, Arnold AFB TN 37389, with a delivery period of 42 weeks after notice of award. A complete Request for Proposal (RFP) with specifications will be available on or about 14 July 2010. Proposal due date will be on or about 4 August 2010 at 2:00 p.m. local time.<br /><br />Request for Proposal will only be available electronically at the FBO website. No hard copies, faxes, or e-mails will be available. Please register as a source to be notified of RFP Amendments, Clarifications, etc. However, it is the responsibility of contractors (even those registered as a source) to check the FBO website frequently to ensure they have all available information.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation is awarding a $41,667 modification to contract NSFPRSS-0000373 with Raytheon Polar Services Company to supplement previously provided ARRA funds for the McMurdo Station Heat Trace project. It is estimated that the work will be completed by March 31, 2011.<br /><br />PER FAR 5.7, THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE, FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER, NSFPRSS-0000373, WHICH WAS COMPETITIVELY AWARDED TO RAYTHEON TECHNICAL SERVICES COMPANY, POLAR SERVICES. THIS CONTRACT WAS NOT AWARDED AS A FIXED PRICE TYPE BECAUSE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DID NOT PERMIT COSTS TO BE ESTIMATED WITH SUFFICIENT ACCURACY TO USE ANY TYPE OF FIXED PRICE CONTRACT. AS SUCH, A COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE ACTION WAS AWARDED (FAR 16.301.2). THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS REQUIRED FOR&nbsp;THE HEAT TRACE PROJECT&nbsp;FOR THE UNITED STATES ANTARCTIC PROGRAM. ALL SUBCONTRACTS PLACED FOR THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE COMPETITIVELY AWARDED AND FIRM FIXED PRICE.

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/NCNR reactor is equipped with a thermal shield.&nbsp; This radiation shield consists of steel and lead that has to be water cooled in order to be kept at a temperature where it does not change shape under its own weight.&nbsp; Over the many years of usage the thermal shield plumbing has developed tiny leaks, which are impossible to repair. <br /><br />Work under this task order requires the fabrication of, installation of, and training for the upgrade of the thermal shield plumbing system whereby the cooling water is administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure as in the present mechanical configuration.<br /><br />The task order has been awarded on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 16.505 (b) (2) (iii).</p>

<DESC>Washington University has the resources, personnel, and the subcontractors currently in place to complete this complex clinical trial. The consequences to children with cerebral palsy because of premature study cessation would be disastrous. The combination of earlier acquired study data with the small amount of additional data needed for statistical significance is essential to demonstrate drug efficacy.  It would cost the Government an inordinate amount of time and effort to train, recruit, and duplicate the effort of the expertise acquired by Washington University and its subcontractors over the past 4 years.

Additionally, the fixed fee does not vary with actual cost but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract, in which this flexibility is desirable for this effort. A Cost Plus Fixed-Fee contract is ideal as it allows for efforts that might otherwise present too great a risk to contractors, but gives the contractor less incentive to control costs than a fixed price contract.

The EMHSS is funded using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) funds through Intra-Departmental Delegation Authority (IDDA). 

This contract action was not of a fixed-price nature.  The cost-reimbursement approach was used because the risk of performance is more than minimal and uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price arrangement.

<DESC>Contractor will complete EBAL requirements for Field Operating Agencies of the Army Staff. These requirements include expanding the classes of supply for optimization to include Class IIIB and Class V and incorporating distribution planning and routing from a previous sense and respond effort. This will result in EBAL applications developed during previous order being integrated into a single application known as Log C2 Portal 2.0.
<p>The&nbsp;the following objectives will be completed:</p>
<p>Integrate and support the TITAN LOE with the EBAL Program.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate a software C2-LOG prototype interface that will allow interoperability between the TITAN Workflow Orchestration Support (WOS) service and the EBAL LogC2 Portal 2.0 software.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate the capability to receive and process C2 orders from the TITAN OPS service via the TITAN WOS as the mediator to the EBAL LogC2 2.0 software.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate the capability to exchange Logistics information from the EBAL LogC2 Portal 2.0 such as logistics alerts, COS recommendation, equipment readiness, and Logistics risk assessments via the TITAN WOS service, as the mediator to other appropriate TITAN support services.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate the capability to receive and process TITAN services, such as C2 Alerts, Battle Book information, and others as appropriate via the TITAN WOS service as the mediator to the EBAL LogC2 software that will process and support logistics COS development.</p>
<p>EBAL Functionality Integration Strategy will be performed&nbsp;as shown below:</p>
<p>&bull; Incorporate the Adaptive Logistics theater-planning capability into the EBAL LogC2 Portal 2.0 to enhance the COS development, Logistics Alerts Engine, Optimization and Risk Assessment resulting in a theater distribution and route plan service.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop an Information Assurance (IA) and Cross Domain Solution (CDS) strategy; including a recommended allocation of EBAL services, applications and data flows.</p>
<p>On the order W91WAW-09-F-0069 which ended 21 September 2010, HTSI performed services to accomplish the EBAL Phase III Logistics Optimization objectives, listed below:</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrated an enhanced COS situational awareness/understanding and effectiveness of the supporting and supported units to achieve the assigned mission/task. Enhanced situational understanding was achieved through focused logistics/materiel supportability at the Tactical level based upon the relative priority established by the Log C2 Portal. <br />&bull; Demonstrated a dynamic planning and execution capability to provide for an executable rank ordering of COS solutions that enhanced the mission COA analysis and supportability.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrated the introduction of new capabilities, such as the reserving of material assets during the planning phase.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrated the Phase III proof-of-concept to determine if the concept would necessitate changes to Army logistics policy and doctrine.</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Pathology & Laboratory Service. 

2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of water services and consumables from Siemens Water Technologies at both divisions of the Pathology & Laboratory Service at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System.

This service has been provided under contract V663P-6008-05 / VA663-C00081 for VA Puget Sound Health Care System which expires 9/30/2010.

Siemens Water Technologies, will be awarded a bridge contract for a period of six (6) months, effective 10/1/2010.  This bridge contract will insure the continuity of this critical service during the solicitation and award process.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  Maintenance services and consumables for the water systems currently in place at both laboratories, to provide de-mineralized water to process lab tests for quality control purposes.   

4.	Statutory Authority:  
( )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.   Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  The Siemens Water system filters water 
      that is supplied to the chemistry analyzers which test more than 75% of the total  
      patient samples (over 5 Million tests a year) for the entire VA Puget Sound, at Seattle, 
      Tacoma, and all CBOC's in the area.  

      The quality and quantity of the water that is used was calibrated to run in the Cobas   
      Chemistry Analyzers, and filters, parts, and preventive maintenance service ensures 
     that water quality will be correct to be used with the chemicals in the Chemistry  
     Analyzer.  Currently, that is calibrated to the Siemens Water System, which is 
     attached to the lab Analyzers. 

     Should the Siemens Water system fail, the entire analyzer system will shut down, and 
     testing of patients for such critical tests as glucose and potassium stop.  This could 
     result in delays to patient treatment.

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  A procurement for Full and open competition is currently in the acquisition planning phase. 

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $11,500.00, which is the same as the pricing in the current purchase order that expires on 30 September 2010, and is determined to be fair and reasonable. Ref: PO# 663-C00081.

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10): Market research was not conducted due to the  	compelling urgency of this requirement. 

9.	Other Considerations:  FAR 6.302-2(b)(2) states that "Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government".  

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: N/A

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: This bridge contract is temporary measure that will insure the continuity of this service during the solicitation and award process for the new contract.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bona fide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle Division.

2.	Description of Action: This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of animal feed for the animals in the Research and Development Service Line. 

Animal Specialties Inc
2300 National Way
Woodburn, OR 97071-9664
1-503-981-4528

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The Research and Development Service Line has a requirement that all animal feed must be of research grade in accordance with the standards of the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.  Contractor must store, maintain and transport animal feed in accordance with guidelines set forth by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations.  Laboratory bedding shall contain no hydrocarbons. Brand Name products are required as specified and no equal substitutions will be considered.   Alternation of the ingredients makeup is not allowed as any changes could negatively impact the outcome of research project results.  The same diet, with no changes, is required throughout the research term. 

4.	Statutory Authority:  
	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(X)  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  6.302-3 Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental or research capability; or expert services.  

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  In the future, the contracting specialist will conduct additional market research for any new vendors that are certified in performing providing animal feed for the Research and Development Service Line.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $42,319.00.  I have reviewed past PO's to determine price reasonableness.  P.O. 663-D01001, $42,560.96 dated 1 Oct 2009 was for the same service. The price has been determined to be fair and reasonable.

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  This Research and Development requirement was originally competed and awarded under VA Contract VA-260-0365. This contract had inadvertently elapsed.  This animal food requirement is essential in sustaining these research animals. All prices were originally competed under this contract. 

9.	Other Considerations: Animal Specialties Inc is a local vendor who has provided very reliable service to the VA. Alternation of the ingredients makeup is not allowed as any changes could negatively impact the outcome of research project results.  The same diet, with no changes, is required throughout the research term. 

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Prior to making another sole source award to this vendor, the contracting specialist will research the market by submitting a sources sought notice through the GSA E-Buy and Fed Biz Ops to ensure no other vendors can offer these items.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
