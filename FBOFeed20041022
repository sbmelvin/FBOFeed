<SUBJECT>D--Commander's Resource Integration System (CRIS)
<SOLNBR>FA8770-05-R-0013
<CONTACT>Rob  Schafer Rob.Schafer@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Force is seeking contractors interested in continuing operations and sustainment for the Commander’s Resource Integration System (CRIS).  CRIS provides Headquarters Air Force level, MAJCOM level, Wing Commanders, Financial Managers, and Resource Managers with the ability to make informed decisions concerning resource allocation through a set of decision support tools. The CRIS data warehouse is a set of distributed hardware and customized software components providing data analysis tools applied to a large subset of Air Force financial, logistics, Civilian Pay, Civilian Personnel, and operations data sourced from existing legacy systems. The Commander's Resource Integration System uses advanced technologies to provide the users with analytical tools that greatly enhance visibility to data required for sound decisions.  These main technologies are Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tools, a suite of database/data warehouse tools, application tools in the form of query tools and web views, and Online Analytical Processor (OLAP) tools. ETL:   Source (legacy) system data is gathered via a specialized File Transfer Protocol (FTP) tool from: the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS), the Command Budget Automated System (CBAS), the Standard Base-Level Supply System (SBSS), the Fuels Enterprise System (FES), the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), Central Procurement Accounting System (CPAS), Commanders On-Line Accounting Reporting System (COARS DBT), and Airlift Services Industrial Fund Integrated Computer System (ASIFICS), Civilian Pay, Civilian Personnel, and Reserve Pay.  ETL tools facilitate the extraction of the data from the source systems, its transformation for use, and its load into the warehouse, driven by business rules. Database: The data warehouse is the collection of data from many systems, stored in multiple databases specifically structured for query and analysis using star schemas.  The CRIS technical team has developed this data warehouse using Microsoft's SQL Server 2000.  The Commander's Resource Integration System has developed relationships between the data from these legacy systems that provides analysts the ability to quickly research all required execution aspects of the program.  The data warehouse is accessed via views.  Access is controlled via role-based security.  The data warehouse tools include query management, load leveling, and data mart management. Application: The CRIS technical team also developed two different tools for the analyst.  The first tool provides a Web interface that displays detailed information.  The Web reports have limited customization but provide a quick means to view the data and the ability to locate variances in the program being queried.  The CRIS tool allows analysts and leaders at all levels to quickly identify problem areas, resolve issues, and reallocate resources to meet current and future needs. The second tool is a client tool that provides the user very detailed and tailored information.  This tool provides for previously unheard of granularity detailing data on a near real-time basis.  The query analysis tool produced by the CRIS technical team uses technology called Online Analytical Processor (OLAP).  OLAP has proved very useful for analyzing data from multiple legacy systems and producing results quickly. CRIS exists as a single logical system consisting of a set of SQL Server 2000 Databases, tightly integrated with a set of Dell Web Servers and managed using a mid-tier server.  Authorized users can access CRIS from anywhere on the ‘.mil’ network using either Internet Explorer or Netscape. The Web and Database servers operate on Windows 2000. Users Supported:  11,500 plus and growing Interested sources should provide a capabilities package (limited to 5 pages with the cover letter excluded from the page count), which demonstrates the experience necessary to successfully support CRIS.  Each package shall include small business status (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), HubZone, etc.) within the NAIC 541519.  Specifically, the capabilities package should demonstrate the following: Experience providing web application development using SQL Server 2000, Visual Basic, Dell Storage Area Network (SAN) in a warehousing environment and Experience supporting the financial functional community as it relates to the Department of Defense. In addition, Past Performance references (minimum of 3, maximum of 5) shall be provided that demonstrates the above experience (does not count against 5 page limit).  Electronic submissions are preferred in Microsoft Word format and delivered either on a 3 ½  floppy, or compact disk media. Capability packages are due within 5 business days from the date of this announcement (27 Oct 04) and shall be sent to: 	Mr. Steven T. Brumfield 	MSG/PKB Bldg. 266 Rm S216 	4225 Logistics Avenue, Room S216 	WPAFB, OH  45433-5755

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253©(1) of the United States Code and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) , with the National Research Council (NRC) of Washington DC, to establish a roundtable aimed at addressing the most pressing vulnerabilities associated with critical interdependent infrastructure systems.  As a federally-established advisory board for scientific and technological matters, the NRC is the only organization in the nation with the stature to attract and gain access to the requisite range of disciplines needed to establish an effective roundtable.  The cost and time for DHS to otherwise obtain the technical expertise that the NRC can quickly assemble for the roundtable would delay the execution of tasks in critical HSARPA and S&T program areas, leaving critical national vulnerabilities unaddressed and degrading the overall mission of S&T.  Additionally, due to the nationally recognized stature and prestige of the NRC, the conclusions and findings of the roundtable will have greater acceptability and credibility among other sectors of government, industry, and the public.  The NRC also has invaluable knowledge on the topic due to their work in this area for past studies, as well as from previous discussions that have occurred between NRC and DHS personnel on this issue. 
NRC was the only source found with the required combination of scientific, technical, and programmatic expertise.  Additionally, they were the only organization capable of assembling the requisite breadth and stature of talent needed for a study of such national importance on extremely short notice.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. 
The period of performance shall be one (1) year from the date of award.  The Government anticipates the award of a fixed price contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation package will be issued.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.    Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Agile Software Corporation for Agile/Oracle software maintenance and technical support for its proprietary configuration management software for the Radar Operations Center (ROC), Norman, Oklahoma.***Background:  The NEXRAD weather radar network is a Tri-agency (DOD, DOC, and DOT) funded and managed program.  The use of the Agile software has enabled the members of the Configuration Change Board (CCB) to efficiently manage and track all technical information pertaining to the NEXRAD weather radar system configuration.  In September of 1993, the Prime Contractor (Unisys) for the NEXRAD weather radar (then referred to as WSR-88D) delivered a database for Baseline Status Accounting.  The product delivered was a front end application entitled “CMStat” that ran on an Ingress database engine.  CMStat used a command line interface that was extremely difficult to use and poorly designed.  Over time, the poorly designed CMStat application began to function extremely slow and failed to meet additional criteria being demanded by the Tri-Agency.  In 1997 the ROC solicited bids for software to replace CMStat and Agile Software was awarded the contract.  In addition to the procurement of the Agile software, in January of 1998 the Agile Software Corporation was contracted to assist the ROC Configuration Management personnel to map the existing data from the CMStat database to the Agile database. This effort required hundreds of man hours to complete and test. An additional three months of dedicated staff hours were necessary to attach graphic files to the document object in the database and modify configuration management processes to the current status.  The ROC uses Agile software to manage technical drawings, technical manuals, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), Engineering Change Orders (ECO), Configuration Change Requests (CCR), Document Change Request (DCR), Artwork Change Order (ACO), CCB member comments, and electronic approval for modifications to the NEXRAD radar system. All of the above listed documentation is contained within the application and may be viewed by any individual having access to the Agile server. The Agile client software gives the end user the ability to view any documents stored in the application even if the software that generated the document does not reside on the local PC.  The Agile software is an integral part of the ROC engineering process tracking and the primary tool used to manage the configuration of the NEXRAD weather radar system.****Requirements:  The ROC requires the delivery of all Agile server and client software upgrades and software patches that become available from the Agile Software Corporation.  The ROC requires that all delivered Agile software be compatible with the existing Agile/Oracle database schema and must maintain the current software functionality.  The ROC requires that all necessary Oracle server and client components and licensing be delivered with any Agile Software releases.  The ROC requires unlimited telephone technical support for Agile server and client software and Oracle server and client software (as it relates to Agile software) be made available, at a minimum, during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO ADD TOPIC AREA 10 - MODELING AND SIMULATION.  THE BAA ANNOUNCEMENT IS REISSUED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THIS IS HQ0006-04-MDA-BAA MODIFICATION 04.
The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capabilities or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these new technologies, the Deputy for Advanced Systems (MDA/AS) established the Advanced Systems Innovation Cell (ASIC) to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  The ASIC team consists of subject matter experts tasked with evaluating new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  The ASIC seeks new and inventive concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.  Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following ten technology areas: (1)Radar Systems, including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Transmit/receive modules, Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; and Passive RF Systems; (2)Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Passive EO/IR Systems including ideas and concepts for IR materials and FPAs that enable high performance passive EO/IR systems that are large format, have multicolor capability, are manufacturable, producible, low cost and have capability to extend to VLWIR operating at temperatures higher than 35° Kelvin, Read-out electronics, Lethality Mechanisms; Laser Imaging with High Frame Rates, Hardware in the Loop (HWIL) testing of Multi-/Hyper-Spectral Sensors, HWIL testing of LADAR systems in a Thermal Vacuum Environment, test of ground, air, space, sea-based operations (all wavelengths will be considered); (3)Mathematics and Computer Science including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Decision Systems, Estimation, Prediction, Homing Navigation, Data Fusion, Pattern Recognition, Identification, Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion and Distributed Systems for Scene Generation; (4)Signal and Data Processing including Digital Electronics and Signal Processing, Machine Implementation of Algorithms, Analog Circuits and Communications, Computer Vision, Distributed Computing; (5)Physics and Chemistry including Electrodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Weapons Effects, Infrared and Optical Signatures, Energy Conversion, and Rocket Plume Analysis; (6)Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering including Space Systems, Micro satellites (bus and payload designs, precision guidance, navigation & control; subsystems, and components-such as precision propulsion and constellation networking), Missile System Aerodynamics, Propulsion, and Reentry Physics, Guidance and Control, Materials Science to include Lightweight, Thermo-Resistant Materials for Boosters; Higher-Pressure Launcher Components for high speed Projectiles, and Erosion-Resistant Launch Tubes for Light Gas Guns, Quantification, prediction, and compensation of aero-optic effects of turbulence on imaging sensors; (7)Battle Management/Command and Control including Engagement Planning, Tactics, Intelligence Exploitation, and Countermeasures, Decision Theory and Modeling, Target Tracking, Classification; Aircraft mountable high bandwidth communications (T1 minimum with T3 or greater preferred) for line of sight and over the horizon data transfer; and Lethality Assessment Technologies, non-real-time, non-tactical (not kill assessment) test applications; and Discrimination and Fire Control; (8)High Altitude Airships technologies including platforms designs, subsystems, components and payloads, electrolyzers, fuel cells, Solar arrays; (9)Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS) to include Divert and Attitude Control Systems technologies at the component/subsystem/system levels for kill vehicle applications.
(10)Modeling and Simulations technologies including Network Emulators for TADL J, S-TADIL J and TADIL K which represent real-time tactical data networks in terms of communication protocols, variable traffic and distance-dependent transport delays, and bit error rates in the presence of variable EMI/ECM; Real-Time IR Digital Scene Generation and Sensor Emulation to generate complex, composite scenes and respond to dynamics associated with interceptor, target complex and background movement, incorporate spatial variability and time-varying noise produced by detector response to generated scenes to exercise the non-uniformity compensation, detection and feature-tracking functions of the sensor software, a real-time standalone system that accepts object states as imputs and outputs real-time detector-corrupted and pixilated video images of complex scenes in LVDS or camera link format; M&S Generation to superimpose synthetic Electro-optic scenes, insitu at the EO sensor detector, while observing real-world scenes (e.g. simulation-over-live during a flight test); and Simulation Framework as an open architecture, open source, M&S simulation framework to perform distributed real-time simulations using reconfigurable objects (all digital, hardware-in-loop or live).  If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (no more than five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .PDF file) to the point of contact listed below.  White paper submissions should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary or trade secret information.  In addition, please advise the Government of any limitations on the Government’s rights in technical data which might be provided in connection with the effort described in the white paper.  MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighted equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offerors’ capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM).  Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35. 016).  White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until January 31, 2006.  Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete.  The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.   Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in FY 2004 through FY 2006.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award) or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award.

The lengths of the vessels are up to 14 and one half inches tall/long and weigh up to 6500 g.  Vessels to be used in this are: 2.2 L Nalgene #2121-0005, Kontes 2.5 L glass #332140-0251, and Millipore ZHE  YT30090HW.  The additional capability for the chamber will remain the same.  The previously given temperature guideline is the only temperature guideline since when it is in operation, that it the temperature range it must maintain.  There is no set g level for the vessels to be exposed to in the  spinning racks.  The radius of the rack should be sufficient to securely hold and rotate the vessels per the stated requirements.  An electronic file to record, save and print the data is not required.  A simple printout of the specified data is required.  The racks should be mounted horizontally,  and racks should not be too low to the ground--causing knee or back strain from reaching with heavy items-- nor should they be placed too high.  This will be the only task for this chamber, so the thermal requirements are specific.  A used thermal chamber would not be acceptable for this  requirement. There are no specifications relating to the minimum amount of vibration that the vessels can experience while they are spinning. No drawings are available for the two (2) 12 place rotating racks.  There is no preference for the brand of Data Logger.  The final date to submit quotes  will be by 2.00p.m. EST, November 5, 2004.  Any questions regarding this solicitation shall be in writing to britt.carole@epa.gov, no telephone inquiries will be entertained.  Except as provided herein, all other terms and conditions remain in full force and effect.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 562211   This is AMENDMENT #2 TO RFQ-RT-04-00504. The purpose of this amendment is to address specific questions/concerns posed by prospective offeror(s). 1.  Is EPA looking for a disposal contractor or a waste characterization contractor? RESPONSE:  This effort is for a  contractor who can dispose of hazardous and radioactive waste in accordance with the Statement of Work. 2.  Does a contract already exist.  If so will it be extended?   RESPONSE:  This effort is not a follow-on to an existing contract. 3.  In order to get pricing for the mixed waste inventory,  the TSDF has requested additional information.  Would it be possible to provide %'s for the components?  For example, item 20110, what % is kepone and what % is acetone?  Also, can the generator provide the waste codes associated with each item? RESPONSE:  With respect to the percentages, when a  chemical is shown in acetone, it is a very low percentage, perhaps even less than 1%.  For all intents and purposes, assume 99% solvent and 1% active ingredient. See EPA Web page(http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/) for the Revised Appendix B which includes waste codes. 4.  You propose a 10%  hold-back until Certificates of Disposal are issued from land disposal facilities.  The mixed waste you offer for disposal cannot be land-disposed.  Low level rad waste disposal facilities do not offer Certificates of Disposal because they are not regulated under RCRA Title C (Haz  Waste). RESPONSE:  EPA reserves the right to hold back 10% until receipt of notification of how, when, and where these wastes have been disposed.  Additionally, there needs to be some written assurance from the receiver of the shipment of low-level radioactive waste ("consignee") of how, when, and  where those wastes have been disposed and not just received for disposal.   5.  Due to the small volume of waste produced at this facility, it is cost prohibitive to pursue direct land disposal (i.e., disposal without intermediate processing via volume reduction techniques such as supercompaction  or incineration).  This requirement should be deleted. RESPONSE:  This requirement can be modified as long as all manifest requirements of 10 CFR 20, Appendix G are met.  Proposals will be evaluated on compliance with requirements of 10 CFR 20, Appendix G. 6.  You stated that the pick-ups must be  performed within 10 days of order receipt. RESPONSE:  The intention for placing control dates on timing of pick-up is to avoid inordinate waits.  The pick-up date is hereby changed from 10 days of order receipt to 60 days of order receipt. 7.  A large technical proposal is not indicated for the  relatively small size of the disposal requirement.  Waste pick-up services have become routine and an examination of the following suggested documentation should be sufficient to review technical competency. (1) A copy of the Contractor's NRC License; (2) names, addresses and permit numbers for  proposed disposal facilities and transporters (there are a very limited number of these that handle low level rad and mixed waste); (3) a statement of qualifications; (4) key personnel resumes; and (5) references. RESPONSE:  The suggested Technical Evaluation Criteria is basically a condensation  of the Evaluation Criteria outline in the original combined solicitation/synopsis. Therefore, the Technical Evaluation Criteria is hereby revised as follows: Evaluation Criteria The following criteria will be applied in the evaluation of the  proposals and the offeror's capability.  The first  three criteria (Technical Evaluation Criteria)  are of equal importance. 1.  Offeror's Capability/qualifications statement which includes the following:   (1) demonstrated knowledge, qualifications, capabilities, and  experience of personnel and the personnel who will be performing under this  contract in hazardous and radioactive waste disposal; (2)  copy of the offeror's NRC Licence and other current applicable federal/state/local licences, permits related to handling, and disposal of hazardous/ radioactive waste materials and environmental protection.  (3) Description of the manner in  which offeror intends to reduce volume of waste as well as dispose of the waste.  (4)  Resumes for key personnel 2.  Names, addresses, phone #, contact person, and permit numbers for proposed disposal facilities and transporters.  3.  Past performance of the contractor in the handling,  transportation, storage, treatment, or disposal of radioactive and mixed waste similar to that generated by the AED laboratory.  Proposals shall be evaluated on performance under existing and prior (within past 3 years) contracts/subcontracts for work similar to that described in the Statement of  Work. The Government's evaluation shall focus on the quality of past performance and level of customer satisfaction. Provide 3-5 references.  For each contract/subcontract identified, the offeror shall include a brief synopsis which includes the date the work was performed, the client for whom the  work was performed (included client name and telephone number), and a description of the work performed. 4.  Proposed Cost

This announcement will result in the award of two contracts. One contract, for the design of the Upper Guadalupe Flood Control Project, NOT including Reach 12, will be awarded on an unrestricted basis.  One contract, for Reach 12, is set-aside for Small Business (SB). In the event there are not at least 3 highly qualified SBs submitting for Reach 12, the SB Set-Aside for the Reach 12 contract will be dissolved, and a separate award will be made for Reach  12 on an unrestricted basis. Except for SB firms that submit on the SB Set-Aside contract for Reach 12, firms interested in being considered for the Reach 12 contract if selection will be made on an unrestricted basis, must submit a separate SF 330, stati ng their intention to be considered for the Reach 12 if it converts to unrestricted. All SBs that submit an SF 330 for the Small Business Set-Aside contract for  Reach 12, will be considered for the Reach 12 contract should it become unrestricted, unless they specifically request not to be considered. The Government reserves the right to award one contract for both parts of the project if selection on an unrestric ted basis for both parts would result in award to the same contractor. The NAICS code for this announcement is 541330, which states the business size standard to be considered a small business is a maximum of $4.0 million of average annual receipts for its  preceding 3 fiscal years. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contr act with small and small disadvantaged firms.

EFFECTIVENESS LEVEL/MAINTENANCE CREDIT
The effectiveness level of each system shall be computed separately, on a month by month basis:
                                                      Operational Use Time (OUT)(hours)
                 EL =  100  *                  Scheduled Use Time (SUT)(hours)

All times will be accrued in 15 minute increments and rounded up to the next highest number of hours when computing the monthly effectiveness level.  Further, if any period of Operation Use Time (OUT) of less than three hours duration is immediately preceded and followed by periods of Down Time, and the CR determines that those Down Times were related, that the period OUT will be considered as Down Time in computing the monthly effectiveness level (EL).  EL will be truncated to an integer number.  Times are defined as follows:
             OUT: Scheduled Use Time (SUT) minus down Time.  Time, accumulated in complete 15 minute intervals, during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is considered available. 
             SUT: Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is scheduled by the Government for operation use.  Scheduled and unscheduled time out are not included in SUT.
             Scheduled Time Out (STO): time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is unavailable for operational use.  The Government designated CR or other authorized personnel may establish STO.  The contractor’s manager or other authorized personnel may establish STO for Preventative Maintenance (PM) with prior concurrence of the government CR, at least 24 hours prior to commencement of STO.
            Unscheduled Time Out (UTO):  Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is unavailable for operational use due to environmental conditions beyond the control of the contractor and the Government, such as hazardous weather conditions, or failure of Government provided facilities or services which are required  for continued operation of the system/equipment, such as physical access to the building containing the system/equipment, or electrical power loss to a system/equipment not connected to the UPS at the MSRC.  UTO shall be recorded after the fact by Government representative in the System Maintenance Event Log for the MSRC, and requires concurrence of the Government’s CR or their designated representative. 
             Down Time:  Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is not available for operational use.  Down Time can only occur during Scheduled Use Time.  Down Time for one contractor maintained system/equipment may result in Down Time for additional contractor maintained system(s)/equipment(s) which depend on that system/equipment for continued operation.  A system/equipment will be considered unavailable for use during an entire 15 minute interval if it is unavailable of used during any portion of the interval.  Down Time shall be record by the Government representative in the System Maintenance Event Log for the MSRC. 

The contractor shall maintain equipment under the contract at a monthly effectiveness level of 98%, at a minimum, for each system/equipment identified.  If the effectiveness level for a system/equipment drops below 98%, the contractor shall grant a 100% maintenance credit.  Maintenance credits will be taken as a discount from the monthly amount due the contractor.  Downtime will be accumulated for the month and rounded off to the next higher hour.   

DISCONTINUANCE OF MAINTENANCE
The Government may, by written notice from the Contracting Officer discontinue maintenance under this contract, at no cost to the Government, thirty (30) days after receipt by the contractor of such notice, or sooner if mutually agreeable to the parties.  Such discontinuance may be on a per piece-basis.

TERMS:  Services to be billed arrears.  Net 30 days. All invoices must first be submitted via the IT Solutions website (https://it-solutions.gsa.gov) for client approval.

SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
Contractor’s terms and conditions shall be incorporated.  However, in the event of a conflict between the content of this Statement of Work and the contractor’s standard terms and conditions, the content of the Statement of Work will take precedence.

Contractor will provide suitably trained personnel to support the task.  Due to the Engineer Research and Development Center’s security requirements all contractor personnel working on this effort shall be United States citizens and capable of gaining access to the facility.


Subpart 39.2 - Electronic and Information Technology
39.201 Scope of subpart.
(a) This subpart implements section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194).
(b) Further information on section 508 is available via the Internet at http://www.section508.gov.
(c) When acquiring EIT, agencies must ensure that--
(1) Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and
(2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from an agency have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.
39.202 Definition.
Undue burden, as used in this subpart, means a significant difficulty or expense.
39.203 Applicability.
(a) Unless an exception at 39.204 applies, acquisitions of EIT supplies and services must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR part 1194.
(b)
(1) Exception determinations are required prior to contract award, except for indefinite-quantity contracts (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section).
(2) Exception determinations are not required prior to award of indefinite-quantity contracts, except for requirements that are to be satisfied by initial award. Contracting offices that award indefinite-quantity contracts must indicate to requiring and ordering activities which supplies and services the contractor indicates as compliant, and show where full details of compliance can be found (e.g., vendor's or other exact website location).
(3) Requiring and ordering activities must ensure supplies or services meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR part 1194, unless an exception applies, at the time of issuance of task or delivery orders. Accordingly, indefinite-quantity contracts may include noncompliant items; however, any task or delivery order issued for noncompliant items must meet an applicable exception.
(c)
(1) When acquiring commercial items, an agency must comply with those accessibility standards that can be met with supplies or services that are available in the commercial marketplace in time to meet the agency's delivery requirements.
(2) The requiring official must document in writing the nonavailability, including a description of market research performed and which standards cannot be met, and provide documentation to the contracting officer for inclusion in the contract file.
39.204 Exceptions.
The requirements in 39.203 do not apply to EIT that--
(a) Is purchased in accordance with Subpart 13.2 (micro-purchases) prior to January 1, 2003. However, for micro-purchases, contracting officers and other individuals designated in accordance with 1.603-3 are strongly encouraged to comply with the applicable accessibility standards to the maximum extent practicable;
(b) Is for a national security system;
(c) Is acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract;
(d) Is located in spaces frequented only by service personnel for maintenance, repair or occasional monitoring of equipment; or
(e) Would impose an undue burden on the agency.
(1) Basis. In determining whether compliance with all or part of the applicable accessibility standards in 36 CFR part 1194 would be an undue burden, an agency must consider--
(i) The difficulty or expense of compliance; and
(ii) Agency resources available to its program or component for which the supply or service is being acquired.
(2) Documentation.
(i) The requiring official must document in writing the basis for an undue burden decision and provide the documentation to the contracting officer for inclusion in the contract file.
(ii) When acquiring commercial items, an undue burden determination is not required to address individual standards that cannot be met with supplies or service available in the commercial marketplace in time to meet the agency delivery requirements (see 39.203(c)(2) regarding documentation of nonavailability).

<SUBJECT>59 -- Sensor Management Architecture
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is actively soliciting industry partners to license, manufacture, and sell a uniquely designed, integrated hardware and software architecture, the Sensor Management Architecture (SMA), to support rapidly deployable, sensor network integration and control.  Supporting applications across wide-area, mobile, urban settings as well as single facilities, Sandia's architecture was developed to support U.S. government homeland security applications in integrating heterogeneous weapons of mass destruction detection technologies into unified sensor networks.  The SMA is based on two Sandia-developed technologies: Intelligent Sensing Modules (ISMs) and the Enterprise Modeling Framework (EMF).  In SMA deployments, the ISM hardware provides the wireless communication and data processing capabilities required for sensor communication and the EMF software provides the data integration architecture and client / server communication capabilities.  ISMs utilize an innovative combination of embedded computation, noise-immune spread spectrum wireless intercommunication, real-time telemetry for integrated and interfaced sensor systems, and a distributed software framework for data aggregation and visualization.  The SMA represents a rapidly deployable, flexible, and robust sensor management system supporting efficient connectivity and management between an arbitrary numbers of movable detectors.

If your company has the technical capability and manufacturing capacity to produce these devices for government and commercial applications, and if you wish to pursue this unique opportunity, please email a brief description of your company, your contact information, and your interests in this venture.  Please respond by email or fax to Colleen Kearney (cakearn@sandia.gov) at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1380, P. O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-1380.  Fax:  (505) 844-8011.

<SUBJECT>B -- National Analytic Center (NAC) for the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and Other Data
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Office of Applied Studies (OAS), intends to procure on an other than full and open competitive basis with Research Triangle Institute, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, for modification of the contract entitled “National Analytic Center (NAC) for National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and Other Data,” to provide continued data statistical support to OAS activities.  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) – only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is considered to be available from only one source because of the lead time required to develop an adequate infrastructure and knowledge of the NAC to provide short turn-around requirements in performing SAMHSA block grant calculations and developing alternative allocation scenarios.  Therefore, SAMHSA has determined that award to any other source would likely require a significant period of knowledge development resulting in a high probability of failure and a significant increase in costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition.   The estimated period of performance is 30 days.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.  No solicitation is available.  Send written responses to the identified point of contact, referencing 283-99-9018.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
