<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

The purpose of this procurement is to continue FHWA's construction cost index, named the National Highway Construction Cost Index (NHCCI). The FHWA built this index using the bid-tabs propriety database previously purchased from Oman Systems, Inc. in year 2010. In order for FHWA to continue its use of the NHCCI, it is necessary that the data stay compatible with FHWA's existing software application. This software allows the FHWA to derive a reliable indicator of highway construction costs that can be used for both general price comparisons and for States to gauge changes in their costs against other States in similar situations. A purchase order, issued under FAR Part 13, is anticipated and the total estimated value is not to exceed $130,855.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Contracts G. Office, Western Federal Lands Highway Division, Phone (360)619-7520, Fax (360)619-7932, Email WFL.Contracts@dot.gov
<DESC><strong>PROJECT:</strong> ID PFH 60-1(2) Manning Crevice Bridge<br /><strong>LOCATION:</strong> On the Clearwater National Forest in Idaho county, Idaho. The project site is located approximately 14 miles east of Riggins, Idaho on the Salmon River Road.<br /><strong>WORK:</strong> Design assistance and construction of 280-ft single tower asymmetric suspension bridge<br /><strong>RANGE:</strong> Between $5 million - $7 million<br /><strong>TENATIVE CONSTRUCTION START DATE:</strong> March 10, 2015<br /><strong>TENATIVE CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION DATE:</strong> August 23, 2017
<p><strong>THIS PROCUREMENT WILL BE ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS (FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION). </strong></p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> This new bridge will replace the historic bridge crossing at Manning Crevice on the Salmon River. The Manning Crevice Bridge, built in the 1930s, is a one-lane suspension bridge. It has reached its service life limit and is experiencing deterioration that threatens its future to carry vehicles. This road provides the only year-round access to nearly 3 million acres of forest land and is the most direct route into this area from Riggins. Salmon River Road provides access to residences, resorts, commercial rafting ventures, and is a main artery for recreational users of the river and forest lands. To view photos of the current bridge go to: http://www.bridgemeister.com/pic.php?pid=905</p>
<p><strong>Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC):</strong> The Western Federal Lands Highway Division (WFL) of the Federal Highway Administration will use CM/GC for the construction of the Manning Crevice Bridge. CM/GC involves the construction contractor in the design process (Pre-construction Phase). During the Pre-construction Phase, the contractor collaborates with both the Government and the A/E design firm. The initial contract will be for the Pre-Construction Phase and will include a Not-to-Exceed amount for the construction work.</p>
<p>Once the design is finalized, we will ask the successful contractor for a final Construction Services price. If we agree on a fair and reasonable price that is at or below the Not-to-Exceed amount, WFL will issue a contract modification to finalize the construction work. If we cannot agree on a construction price, the contract will be considered complete and WFL will solicit the construction of this bridge under a new construction solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Construction Services:</strong> During the Pre-construction Phase, the Contractor will be required to work with WFL and the A/E Designer to develop a quality and cost effective design. This includes minimizing risk, improving the construction schedule, reducing costs, eliminating constructability barriers, helping resolve design problems that have the potential of jeopardizing the project's completion, and so on.</p>
<p>WFLHD will rely on the construction contractor to provide pre-construction services such as the following:<br />&bull; Work with WFL and the A/E to develop a quality and economical design<br />&bull; Coordinate design input from key subcontractors<br />&bull; Collaborate with the Government and A/E <br />&bull; Detect and report errors and omissions found in the specifications and drawings<br />&bull; Submit monthly summary of actions completed<br />&bull; Attend regular teleconferences with the Government and A/E<br />&bull; Conduct constructability reviews at 50%, 70%, and 95%<br />&bull; Provide cost estimates at 50%, 70% and 95%<br />&bull; Identify potential risks (including financial risks) and methods to mitigate them <br />&bull; Identify issues with the proposed construction schedule and recommend solutions</p>
<p><strong>Construction Services:</strong> The Bridge as proposed will be a single tower asymmetric suspension bridge. The structure will be one-lane (16 feet wide) 280 foot span. Some approach work, including retaining walls and rock excavation is also anticipated as part of this proposed project. See "Construction Phase PROJECT DESCRIPTION" posted with this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Construction Challenges:</strong> This is a complicated structure that will require an experienced bridge contractor. The difficult terrain and limited space available to build will present unique challenges in the construction of this new bridge. Challenges include:<br />&bull; Steep and rocky remote canyon site location<br />&bull; Site access via a one-lane road with occasional pull-off areas; limited width, height, and load capacity along with extremely tight turns at each approach<br />&bull; Very tight construction site that is close to the existing suspension bridge<br />&bull; Unique asymmetrical suspension bridge construction<br />&bull; Challenging cable anchorage locations<br />&bull; Rock excavation adjacent to the existing suspension bridge<br />&bull; Maintenance of vehicle traffic with only limited closures allowed<br />&bull; Fast-flowing river with heavy recreational use (approximately 110 boats/rafts per day during the peak season)<br />&bull; The existing Manning Crevice Bridge must remain in service until the new bridge is ready for use</p>
<p>Access to the bridge site is very restricted. From US 95 south of Grangeville, Idaho you turn east at Riggins onto the Salmon River Road, which is a one-lane road with occasional pull-off areas. Approximately 7 miles east of Riggins, there is a one-lane through-truss bridge (Lake Creek Bridge) over which all equipment will need to pass. There are no other feasible access roads.</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation:</strong> The solicitation documents will be available for download on this Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. They will include submittal and source selection details.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Us:</strong> General questions should be submitted to WFL.Contracts@dot.gov. Technical questions should be submitted to plans_spec@dot.gov (plans_spec@dot.gov) or FAX to 360.619.7932.</p>
<p><strong>This paragraph announces possible financing available to small businesses.</strong> The three types of businesses that are eligible to receive a loan through this program are: (1) Firms that have received DBE certification from a state or local transportation agency; (2) Eligible small business firms; and (3) Firms that have received a disability rating by the Veteran's Administration and have certified themselves as a SDVOSB.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</strong>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to the Washington Hospital Center, Department of Emergency Medicine, 110 Irving St. NW, Suite NA1177, Washington, DC 20010-2975 to provide Professional Support Services for the NIDCR Dental Clinic in accordance with the following information:</p>
<p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
<p>The Clinical Resource Core ("the Dental Clinic"), Office of the Clinical Director, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research requires a part-time Oral Surgeon. The Contractor shall either be an Oral Surgeon or a hospital, post-graduate dental school, or dental professional corporate entity that can provide a qualified Oral Surgeon. The Contractor shall refer to the business entity ("the Contractor") whereas the Oral Surgeon will be the individual providing the actual services to the Dental Clinic (referred to as "the Oral Surgeon").</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The Oral Surgeon shall facilitate the delivery of treatment and consultative services in the Dental Clinic, interacting closely with primary care givers and other members of the medical team and triaging patient treatment needs. Dental and Medical Staff will refer difficult cases to the Oral Surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>Services to be Performed</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>- Provide an Oral Surgeon that performs at professional clinical standards and possesses knowledge and skills related to the mission of the Dental Clinic;<br />- Ensure that the Oral Surgeon possesses a valid Maryland State dental license, Acute Life Support Certificate, and medical malpractice to cover the Oral Surgeon's medical liability. The Contractor should have minimum malpractice coverage rates of $1,000,000 per occurrence and $3,000,000 aggregate;<br />- Ensure that the Oral Surgeon can be credentialed at the NIH Clinical Center;<br />- Give prompt notification when the Oral Surgeon can no longer perform at the Dental Clinic. Prompt notification means as soon as the Contractor learns of the Oral Surgeon's inability to perform his/her duties at the NIDCR Dental Clinic;<br />- Grant the Oral Surgeon time to work in the NIDCR Dental Clinic for at least one day per week in consultation with the Clinical Director and the Chief of Consults; and,<br />- Provide a replacement Oral Surgeon if the assigned Oral Surgeon is unable to fulfill their clinical duties. In the event that the contractor cannot provide an Oral Surgeon to come to the Dental Clinic and provide services, the contractor will treat patients at their own clinic or hospital. The contractor may bill for the services off the existing contract. The Contractor will be responsible for any and all costs associated with completing the procedure at their own clinic or hospital.</p>
<p>The Oral Surgeon shall:</p>
<p>- Perform both routine and complicated oral surgery procedures, including but not limited to oral biopsies, exodontias (tooth extractions), surgical extractions, hip biopsies, implants, and oral consultations. The Oral Surgeon should be competent in provision of accompanying IV sedation; and,<br />- Possess knowledge of systemic biology, complex oral lesions, and oral manifestations of systemic conditions. The Oral Surgeon should have experience with unique populations groups, such as, primary immunodeficiencies, blood dyscrasias, syndromic and genetic conditions, infectious diseases, and cancer therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The NIDCR Clinical Director will evaluate the performance of the Contractor and Oral Surgeon. The NIDCR Clinical Director may request reports or performance evaluations from the contractor to access the overall clinical performance of the Oral Surgeon for credentialing evaluation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</strong></p>
<p>Any reporting requirements / deliverables will be determined post-award.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong></p>
<p>The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Place of Performance</strong></p>
<p>The place of performance will be onsite at the NIDCR Dental Clinic on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Washington Hospital Center has an NIH credentialed Oral Surgeon capable of performing the tasks in the statement of work. The NIDCR Dental Clinic has patients scheduled that are tied to clinical research protocols and having another contractor provide an Oral Surgeon would result in severe delays in seeing those patients and obtaining the necessary data that will be used in those protocols. It would be detrimental to the Government and experiments in progress.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, with a business size standard of $14.0M. However, this solicitation is not a small business set aside. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-70 (September 13, 2013).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by November 12, 2013 at 9:00am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>

Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Indianapolis, IN 46250 pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This request is for the procurement of #3305F Non-Swiss Albino NSA (CF-1) Mice on an as needed basis. The award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract for a Base Year (12/16/2013 - 12/15/2014) and four (4) Option Years. An estimated quantity of 1,800 Mice, Female, 21-24 g, approx. 5 weeks old, will be ordered during each of the performance periods.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation will be subsequently issued. <br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director, Office of Research Information Systems (ORIS) intends to solicit proposals from capable Small Business Offerors to procure Scientific Information Analysts (SIA) and Scientific Text Analyst (STA) for the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC) Program. <br />The Office of Research Information Systems of the NIH was established in 2005. Its mission is: (1) to support the NIH and HHS research grants program from initiative planning and application submission through grant closeout and reporting, (2) to electronically capture and manage research related data, (3) to report these data as information to NIH and extramural communities, and (4) to enable the synthesis of that information into knowledge that can guide the management of the NIH research portfolio and improve the Nation's health.<br />As sister programs within ORIS, RCDC relies upon Electronic Research Administration (eRA) to receive, structure and store scientific research project data upon which RCDC categorizes and reports on research supported by HHS. Each year the NIH reports to Congress and the public how much it spends on various diseases, conditions, and other research areas. This information is presented in various budget documents, as well as on the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) Estimates for Disease Spending website and in response to ad hoc requests from within the Executive Branch, Congress, constituent groups and others. The RCDC program provides categorical project listings, including financial award data, allowing users to understand what is spent in scientific research areas. This process began in FY2008 in an effort to universally define the research areas, delivering categorization data with a degree of robustness, consistency, and transparency across all Institutes and Centers (IC). The semi-automated, text-mining-based process enables NIH to quickly replicate and access RCDC reporting data as expected by Executive Branch officials, Congress, the press, constituency groups, and the public. <br />Objectives<br />This contract is to provide Scientific Information Analysts and Scientific Text Analysts to the ORIS RCDC program for the purpose of developing, analyzing and maintaining standardized biomedical categories; ensure the accuracy of the categories based on NIH IC expert feedback; develop and maintain category documentation; facilitate research category sessions with IC experts; and ensure optimization of the text mining application and NIH data.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goals<br />The goal of this procurement is four-fold: (1) to provide expertise in the areas of biomedical sciences, such as, but not limited to, biology, chemistry, physical, and health sciences; (2) to maintain the accuracy of the categories; (3) fulfill categorical reporting needs; and (4) provide support to meet the needs of the end user community and their expectations for service. <br />Below are the characteristics of the ORIS Scientific Information Analyst and Scientific Text Analyst requirements:<br />1.

The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.219-7009 the 8(a) firm shall not subcontract the performance of any of the requirements of the contract without the prior written approval of the SBA and the Contracting Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally FAR Clause 52.219-14 defines the limitations on subcontracting should approval to subcontract be obtained.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: red"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></strong>Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within <span style="COLOR: black">the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed</span>.

Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>

The updates will cover a three year term, and will include maintenance and technical support. There will be only one award made for this requirement.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This acquisition is unrestricted.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541519 and $25.5M respectively.  FOB is destination.

<a href="mailto:sara.d.pines@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Norfolk</a>
<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS  UNRESTRICTED.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District has a requirement for beach restoration dredging for NASA Wallops Island Post Hurricane Sand Shoreline <br> Restoration  Project.   <br>  <br> Hurricane Sandy hit the nearly completed NASA Wallops Island (WI) beach construction project area in late October 2012.  All dredging and heavy beach construction elements of beachfill project were complete.  But, only a third of the sand fencing was in place and all of this was at the northern end of the project area.  No dune stabilization planting had occurred y et.  Sand fencing was reasonably effective in minimizing sand losses where it was installed, limiting the significant sand losses to the othern approximately 12,300 LF of WI. <br>  <br> The proposed restoration construction contract Plans and Specifications were prepared by Norfolk District.  The contract scope includes the following: <br>  <br> a.	 Dredge and place from 600,000 cubic yards (base contract amount) to approximately cubic yards (with 2,100,000 CY Options) of sand on the southern 12,300 LF of Wallops Island to restore the damaged dunes and berms to as close to the original construction as built elevations and shoreline protective capabilities.  Due to the presence of stabilized dunes and berm grasses in some areas, the most cost effective restoration designs differ in some respects from the original As Builts. <br> b.	Option 3:  As funding permits, this Option covers repairs/replacement of less than 350 LF of sea wall at the southernmost extent of the project area immediately in fron the NASA Launch facility's South Camera Stand. <br> c.	Sand fencing will be installed along all restored dunes following Government acceptance of sections. <br> d.	The Restoration Construction Contractor will also be expected to produce both pre- and post- construction surveys to confirm dredging volumes required and to generate As Built plans for the District and the District's customer. <br>  <br> The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract using INVITATION FOR BID WITH PRE-AWARD SURVEY and procedures outlined in FAR Parts 36 and 14.  Pre-award survey will determine contractor's responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104 and 9.106. <br>  <br> Bidders will be evaluated on both pre-award and conformance to the solicitation and price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all Bids and to award the contract to other than the lowest total price and to award to the bidder submitting the lowest bid determined by the Government to be responsible.  The magnitude of construction is estimated between $1,000,000 -$5,000,000. <br>  <br> The anticipated date of the solicitation is on or about 08 November 2013. <br>  <br> NAICS CODE 237990 applies to this procurement.  Submission requirements (plans/specs) will be available on/about 08 November 2013 via Fedeeral Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps, https://www.fbo.gov).  Bid bonds will be required with Bid submittals.  Search on W91236% for solicitations issued by Norfolk District.  No hard copies will be available.  Prospective contractors MUST be register in the DOD System for Award Management (SAM) database in order to obtain access to FedBizOpps.  It is incumbent upon vendors to monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation, specification, drawings and all subsequent amendments.  SAM Registration must also be ACTIVE and current to be eligible for contract award.  Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Intenet at http://www.sam.gov.  lack of registration in the SAM database will prevent access to FedBizOpps and will make a Bidder ineligible for award.  NOTE:  Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) apply to this solicitation.  With ORCA, vendors have the ability to enter and maintain representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov;  therefore, vendors no longer have to submit representations and certifications with bid.

<DESC>Protective Cover System for the M119A3 Howitzer <br> Request for Information (RFI) <br>  <br>  <br> GENERAL INFORMATION: <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command (ACC) Contracting Center - New Jersey is conducting a Market Survey on behalf of the Program Manager - Towed Artillery Systems (PM-TAS) for a protective cover system for the M119A3 Howitzer, known hereinafter the  quote mark cover system quote mark .   The U.S. Government (USG) appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  This market survey requests information in support of a possible competition for the cover system.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This RFI is for planning purposes only and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). This does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time, nor is there an estimated date of solicitation release at this time.  <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br>  <br> The purpose of this notice is to identify POTENTIAL SOURCES who have the capability/interest to manufacture the cover system and to optimize the performance specification to be used when/if the Government procures such as system.  The cover system is a set of covers used to protect the M119A3 Howitzer in an outdoor long term storage environment.  The draft Performance Specification 13051908 describes the required characteristics for this cover system. <br>  <br> INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THIS SURVEY: <br>  <br> 1. Refer to the point of contact (POC) in part 6 of the MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE section to acquire the draft Performance Specification 13051908, the associated drawing 13027100 and the Requirement and Verification Survey Form. <br>  <br> 2. Number the response with the appropriate question number. <br>  <br> 3. Repeat the question in your response.  <br>  <br> 4. Where rationale is required, provide details.  <br>  <br>  <br> MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE:  <br>  <br> 1. Company Name:  <br>  <br> 2. Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code:  <br>  <br> 3. Provide a rough order of magnitude unit price cost production estimate based on a total order quantity of 700 cover systems.  <br>  <br> Assumptions - The following assumptions should be taken into account when preparing the production cost estimate.   <br>  <br> a. Government Furnished Material to be included: None <br>  <br> b. Production Quantity:  PM TAS anticipates procurement of approximately 700 cover systems <br>  <br> c. Schedule: Production quantities to be delivered over a 3 year period. <br>  <br> 4. Using the Requirement and Verification Survey Form identify if each requirement and verification method is: <br>  <br> a. Acceptable as is  <br> b. Should be removed  <br> c. Should be modified <br>  <br> by putting an  quote mark X quote mark  in the appropriate column. <br>  <br> If you feel a requirement and or verification method should be removed, in a separate MS Word file, identify the requirement and verification method by paragraph number and provide the rationale.  Please provide as much rationale detail as possible. Examples of different forms of rationale: The requirement is unachievable.  The requirement is redundant. The requirement provides little or no benefit. The requirement adds little benefit and greatly adds to the unit price cost (in this instance always quantify the unit price cost impact).   <br>  <br> If you feel a requirement and or verification method should be modified, in a separate MS Word file, identify the requirement and verification method by paragraph number; provide the modified language for the requirement and verification method; and provide the rationale.  Examples of different forms of rationale: will make requirement achievable, will provide added protection, or will reduce unit price costs (in this instance always quantify the unit price cost impact).   <br>  <br> 5. Identify any requirements and corresponding verification methods you believe should be added to the draft performance specification in a separate MS Word file.  Provide the new language for the requirement(s) and verification method(s); and provide rationale for the additional requirement(s) i.e. explain how it will benefit usage or the requirement of protecting the M119A3 howitzer. <br>  <br> 6. Response to the Market Survey Questionnaire should be sent via Email to craig.a.carbone.civ@mail.mil; with a copy furnished to scott.r.ferrante.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  Product Manager - Soldier Protective Equipment (PM-SPE) is seeking technical and cost information from manufacturers regarding the availability of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) Blast Gauge Systems.  This notice constitutes a Request for Information ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no contracts will be awarded for this effort at this time.  However, please include a statement regarding your interest in responding to any future PM-SPE solicitations related to this effort.  Be advised that the Government may seek unlimited data rights from vendors who express an interest in participating in any follow-on solicitations. <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION:  The Blast Gauge System is an environmental sensor that measures blast overpressures.  After review and evaluation of industry submissions, samples of the most desirable candidate products may be procured for a Soldier Protection Demonstration (field testing) to evaluate the efficacy of the products identified and determine their suitability for Army use. The Blast Gauge System will go through product verification testing (i.e. Overpressure Measurement, Acceleration Measurement, etc.). <br>  <br> The Army seeks a Soldier-borne Blast Gauge System for the purposes of detecting and measuring blast overpressures and the resultant accelerations that affect the Warfighter on the battlefield.  The data shall be stored on the device and capable of transmitting to a computer via USB.  The data from this device will feed into overpressure-based injury models for head and body injuries.  The data necessary for injury modeling includes the peak overpressure, the slope of the overpressure peak rise and the calculated impulse.   <br>  <br> The device shall be secured to the outer portion of a soldier's uniform or IOTV during missions.  If a blast were to be detected, a Soldier activated status button should inform the soldier or his chain-of-command that there is an event file for downloading.  <br>  <br> The device shall be durable and reliable, affected neither by water immersion, sun, dust or sand exposure and be resistant to extreme hot and cold temperatures.  It shall comply with EMI specifications. <br>  <br> The Blast Gauge System should include a software application for configuring the blast gauges, issuing the blast gauges to Soldiers and downloading data. <br>  <br> Additional desired Blast Gauge System characteristics: <br>  <br>  	User Interface. The device's interface should notify the user of its status. Status states should include, but are not limited to: <br> o	Significant event stored <br> o	Charging <br> o	Fault <br> o	Damaged sensor <br>  	Data storage. The device shall store not less than 5 events <br>  	Overpressure measurements.  The device shall record overpressure from 3-100 psi as a function of time for the duration of an event.    <br>  	Data screening: The software or firmware shall be capable of screening out false or erroneous data. <br>  <br> Responses from interested businesses should include the following: <br> 	 <br> 1)	Business name, address, and point of contact information (name, email and phone number). <br> 2)	Information on existing contracts, such as GSA or other Government agency contracts, under which the required items could be purchased. <br> 3)	Product description, technical specifications, cost estimate (unit cost for 10-20 items), and discussion of compliance with performance requirements listed above. <br> 4)	Discussion of production capability and ability to provide 10-15 production Blast Gauge Systems along with Safety Assessment Report and instructions for use NLT 30 days ARO if the design is included in the Soldier Protection Demonstration.   <br> 5)	Discussion of warranty provisions.  <br>  <br> All interested companies, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this RFI by submitting the above information NLT COB 6 December 2013.  Companies that submit the required cost and technical information will have an opportunity to demonstrate their product on 16-17 December 2013 at the PM-SPE conference room, Building 328T at 10170 Beach Road, Fort Belvoir, VA, 22060, telephone: 703-754-9318.   <br>  <br> Please only submit information on products that are currently commercially available or products that are in the final stages of development and will be available for demonstration.  All products must comply with the Buy American Act and the Berry Amendment.  <br>  <br> The Government will not pay for information or products received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.  Inclusion in this RFI or the resulting Soldier Protection Demonstration does not constitute Department of the Army approval for, or acceptance of, any product.  The Government may request the item be left for up to 10 days for analysis and to adequately review the item's features and capabilities.  Proprietary information should be clearly marked and will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. <br>  <br> This information should be provided to the contracting office at US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Division F, ATTN: Shawn L. Jamerson, Contract Specialist, Team Quick, by email at Shawn.L.Jamerson.civ@mail.mil.  The Government does not guarantee that this RFI will result in a Request for Proposal (RFP) or contract award, and will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred by vendors who respond to the RFI.  Interested vendors will be advised if and when the Government decides to pursue a formal RFP or solicitation.  Please direct all questions relating to this RFI to the contracting office, Shawn L. Jamerson, Contract Specialist at 410-278-5412 or email Shawn.L.Jamerson.civ@mail.mil.

<p><br />G. POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Guidelines<br />Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, the incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program(s), and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program(s). <br />Coordinates and communicates complex, multi-part plans and updates with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military, and the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact broader programs. Projects are often broad in scope and complicated by many complex features: technical, administrative, and/or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands<br />In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around Afghanistan is likely; station post in either Kabul or other Afghan provinces is possible. While on site visits, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended on-site visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain, and wearing heavy body armor. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty, windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>Level of Effort<br />Hours for this full-time position will be the core hours of U.S. Embassy Kabul: 8:30 am to 5:30 pm Saturday through Thursday, with additional hours to fulfill a minimum of 55 hours per week.</p>
<p><br />Travel and Position Location<br />Frequent travel in and around Afghanistan's provinces is likely; other international and U.S. domestic travel is possible. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by Chief of Mission transport and U.S. Government vehicles and aircraft; all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airline.</p>
<p>Security Clearance<br />The position requires the selectee to attain and maintain a Department of State Secret security clearance.</p>
<p><br />F. EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to provide expert justice subject matter and policy recommendations to senior level policy makers within the Embassy and INL. 20 %<br />&bull; Experience and ability to assess current programs and assist in developing and plans for improving U.S. capacities to implement justice programs. 20 % <br />&bull; Ability to liaise with members of relevant USG agencies, Host National representatives, and the international community in developing and coordinating justice programs. 20%<br />&bull; Ability to liaise with members of relevant USG agencies, Host National representatives, and the international community in developing and coordinating justice programs. 20%<br />&bull; Ability to communicate complex issues in a timely and concise manner, both orally and in written form. 10 %<br />&bull; Experience in working in a complex, stressful, or overseas environment. 10 %</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time. No response will be provided to requests for solicitation. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.<br />The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has a requirement as follows:
<p>DTRA is the Department of Defense (DoD) executive agent for the Nuclear Arms Control Technology (NACT) program which supports one of the six safeguard assurances associated with the original U.S. Senate ratification effort for the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).  The NACT program manages, operates, and sustains the U.S. segment of the International Monitoring System (IMS) monitoring stations for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO).</p>
<p>The IMS was established to detect worldwide nuclear weapons tests via an extensive monitoring network that includes seismic, infrasound, hydro-acoustic and radionuclide monitoring technologies.  Relevant to this Sources Sought Notice are infrasound and seismic monitoring stations (collectively called "waveform" stations) located in the continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S.-controlled Pacific Territories and Antarctica.     For planning purposes, and likely by the start of FY15, 25 of 26 required US IMS waveform stations will be fully installed and operating.  However, DTRA seeks a performer to operate and sustain only 13 of the U.S. IMS waveform stations (7 Infrasound (IS), one Primary Seismic (PS), and 5 Auxiliary Seismic (AS)) monitoring stations beginning on 1 October 2014.  The remaining twelve US IMS waveform stations will be operated and maintained by the US Air Force (USAF) or the US Geological Survey (USGS).  The USAF will operate and maintain four PS and one Hydro-acoustic stations, and USGS will operate and maintain seven AS stations.</p>
<p>Each of the US IMS waveform stations is necessarily a custom design and installation intended to optimize data quality and availability and to control long-term sustainment costs of the US IMS.  Once installed, the configuration of these stations is strictly controlled and all changes must be approved and documented.  The monitoring station locations, specified by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, include a wide range of disparate and extreme environments.  The US IMS station operations are generally automated, but, stations also require preventative and occasional unscheduled maintenance.  Station operations also include the routine provision and maintenance of technical documentation and timely station and data reporting as required by CTBTO Provisional Technical Secretariat.  Additional requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>1.	Operate and maintain seven infrasound arrays for the U.S. monitoring effort at the following locations: Fairbanks, Alaska (IS53); Windless Bight, Antarctica (IS55); Newport, Washington (IS56); Pinon Flat, California (IS57); Kona, Hawaii (IS59); Midway Island (IS58); and Wake Island (IS60).<br />2.	Operate and maintain one primary seismic station at Mina, Nevada (PS47). <br />3.	Operate and maintain five auxiliary seismic stations at the following locations; Tuckaleechee Caverns, TN (AS107); Pinon Flat, CA (AS108); Yreka, CA (AS109); Kodiak Island, AK (AS110); and Shemya, AK (AS112).<br />4.	Provide all necessary engineering and logistical support and configuration management for waveform station structures and installed systems, including component repair, procurement of spare parts, hardware and software upgrades, tools and consumables and support the configuration change process for 13 stations listed in paragraphs 1-3.<br />5.	Advise the NACT program office on operational and technical and performance issues arising from USGS supported Auxiliary Seismic IMS stations in Albuquerque, NM (AS111); Elko, NV (AS113); South Pole, Antarctica (AS114); Newport, WA (AS115); San Juan, Puerto Rico (AS116); Guam (AS105); and Palmer Station Antarctica (AS106).  <br />6.	Provide all necessary configuration management for the 7 AS US IMS stations and structures and installed systems listed in paragraph 5. <br />7.	Perform preventive and unscheduled corrective maintenance of the station structures and equipment to ensure optimum operation of the station.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a.	Preventive maintenance to be performed routinely to prevent a fault occurring with a particular piece of equipment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; b.	Unscheduled maintenance to repair or correct a fault in a particular piece of equipment, and the timely restoration of the station to fully operational condition.<br />8.	Provide coordination for and conduct NACT waveform O&amp;M support activities in accordance with all existing or planned support agreements with the National Science Foundation (NSF) for Antarctic stations and the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), US Fish and Wildlife Services, and other entities for various other stations.</p>
<p>Sources having the capability and/or concept to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this notice.  Responses should be limited to a two (2) page white paper in 12 point Courier New font for any given concept, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents.  Any proprietary concepts of information should be clearly identified as such.  Submitted data and information will not be returned.  Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary.  This notice is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.</p>
<p>Electronic responses are required and shall be submitted to Mr. Jerry "Buddy" Woods at jerry.woods@dtra.mil.  All emails should include in the subject line the Reference Number and the submitting organization's name.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought Notice.

<DESC><br />Expressions of Interest Sought Succeeding Lease -Merrick County, Nebraska
<p><br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Central City, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3395 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3005 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 11/1/2014.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 28 on site hard surface parking spaces, including 3 official Government vehicles (2 trucks and 1 trailer)<br />&bull; Specific Information Technology requirements</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.

<p><br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Schuyler, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3416 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3050 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 11/1/2014.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 26 on site hard surface parking spaces, including 4 official Government vehicles <br />&bull; Specific Information Technology requirements</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br /><br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The US General Services Administration (GSA) is conducting market research on alternative transportation services such as car sharing. The purpose of this RFI is two-fold:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Obtain written responses to the attached Market Research Questionnaire due <strong>11/15/13</strong>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Invite industry to attend an Industry Day <strong>11/18/13</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>&nbsp; Consistent with FAR Part 10, Market Research, GSA is conducting market research to determine if it should acquire alternative transportation services and how best to do so. GSA is interested in being able to provide its customers a variety of transportation solutions designed to fit a customer&rsquo;s vehicle needs. For example, for customers that only need transportation intermittently, it may be more cost beneficial to use a car sharing service in lieu of renting, leasing and/or purchasing a vehicle. To that end, GSA asks that interested parties <strong><em>complete the attached questionnaire no later than 4:30PM, November 15, 2013</em></strong> and return it to Patricia Hoffman at Patricia.Hoffman@gsa.gov and onthego@gsa.gov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Invitation to Attend Industry Day <br /></strong><br />&nbsp; The Travel, Motor Vehicle and Card Services (TMVCS) Portfolio is pursuing an array of car sharing initiatives to help federal agencies reduce costs, improve service and optimize their use of vehicles. TMVCS has monitored industry developments for car sharing services and the increasing number of vendors and locations available at this time lend itself to a government-wide pilot program to determine how best to take advantage of alternative transportation services. TMVCS&rsquo; goal in this effort is to drive agency cost savings while simultaneously allowing the agency to focus resources on their mission instead of on the ancillary services that GSA can provide more efficiently.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;TMVCS may issue a pilot BPA where it will use the vendors currently on Schedule 48 Special Item Number (SIN) 411-2 to conduct a pilot in four metropolitan cities (New York City, Washington DC, Boston and Chicago) and to meet immediate agency needs. Vendors must be on schedule to be able to participate in the initial BPA, but TMVCS anticipates adding vendors to the BPA throughout its life cycle. Therefore, concurrent to any potential government-wide pilot BPA effort, TMVCS wants to expand the number of car sharing service providers and additional cities serviced. To accomplish this, TMVCS will hold an industry day on <strong><em>Thursday, November 18, 2013 from 1pm to 4pm Eastern Time at the GSA Central Office located at: <br /></em></strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> 1800 F Street NW <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Washington DC 20405<br /><br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The dual purpose of this industry day is to obtain additional suppliers and information as well as educate new car sharing vendors how to participate on Schedule 48. <strong><em>Please RSVP not later than COB Friday, November 8, 2013</em></strong> by replying to Patricia Hoffman at Patricia.Hoffman@gsa.gov and onthego@gsa.gov in order to provide the security desk a list of attendees. Plan on arriving 15 minutes early to clear security. TMVCS will confirm your reservation via email with the room number. Follow up vendor appointments will be available after the industry day has concluded as requested. In your RSVP request, please note whether you are interested in a follow up vendor appointment (via phone or in person) and identify dates and times that work best. The vendor appointment will be an opportunity to provide talk to the Government regarding your firm&rsquo;s capability to perform car sharing services.

Architectural renderings for conceptual project design features, such as: proposed cut-off wall alignment, subsurface conditions, design concepts, and hydrographs will be provided before the Construction Industry Day on the following link:  http://www.mvs.usace.army.mil/Missions/ProgramsProjectManagement/idmp.aspx and hardcopies will be available at the meeting.  Read ahead material will be posted by November 22, 2013.  The event will also include a question and answer workshop and one-on-one private sessions with a Government team.  To ensure a thorough understanding of the project, contractors are encouraged to view the project site prior to or the day of the event. The project site is in close proximity to the Industry Day location.  <br>  <br> Constructability Questions to Industry: The Government is seeking industry feedback on the project information and additional questions which will be provided on the previously mentioned website by November 22, 2013. <br>  <br> All interested parties, regardless of event attendance, are encouraged to voluntarily submit written responses, constructive input, or additional questions. Responses may be submitted prior to, during or after the event. Please send advance responses to Barrietta.Killiebrew@usace.army.mil. Responses are intended to initiate discussion during a facilitated, group question and answer session.  <br>  <br>  <br> One-on-one Sessions: Please indicate on the Registration Form if you would like to sign up for a one-on-one session.  Please be prepared to discuss the questions below, which will be used to guide the discussions.  These questions may be modified.  Any modifications will be posted on the previously mentioned website prior to the event.    <br>  <br>  <br> 1.	It is anticipated that funding constraints will lead to construction of the cut-off wall in phases. Is there a minimum (or maximum) length of wall we should place in a single solicitation to avoid unnecessary efficiency losses?  If so what are those limits?  Should anything else (other than cut-off wall length) be considered for the contract package?    <br>  <br> 2.	Considering cost efficiency - What is the optimum contract value needed to ensure sufficient competitive bids from qualified contractors in this industry? <br>  <br> 3.	What issues do you anticipate going through the cobble and boulder zones in the aquifer?  Drilling mud loss has been encountered in the cobble and boulder zones.  How would your firm mitigate this risk?  How should the government's specifications address cobbles and boulders to best mitigate risk and reduce contingencies in bids? <br>  <br> 4.	Are there any work platform or layout requirements not accounted for by government in the typical cross sections provided?  Is the government including work area accommodations that are unnecessary? <br>  <br> 5.	It is anticipated the cut-off wall will bisect at least two active pipelines.  We are considering use of jet grouting in these to cut-off the underseepage.  What concerns should we consider when specifying this method?  Are there other methods we should consider specifying for seepage cutoff in the area of these pipeline crossings? <br>  <br> 6.	It is anticipated that the cut-off wall will run in parallel with three utilities (one gas line and two telecommunication lines).  Care must be taken in design not to damage the existing utilities.  What range of equipment loadings should our design account for in these areas?  Are there specific methods for dealing with parallel utilities that we should consider? <br>  <br> 7.	Do you anticipate any additional problems for your operation not discussed in the preceding questions with respect to design, production, and safety/stability? <br>  <br> 8.	What other feedback would you like to provide for consideration to improve the constructability of this project? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Capability Statements: Interested parties, regardless of event attendance, are invited to submit capability statements for market research purposes and acquisition strategy planning (5-page limit). A recommended outline at Attachment-B.  Please submit capability statements to Corps Contracting Division Representatives at the event, or mail to: Contracting Division, Attn: Barrietta Killiebrew, USACE - St. Louis, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, MO 63103-2833. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> This notice does not constitute a solicitation.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only.

The purpose of this is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification relative to NACIS 541380. Responses will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses are not considered responses to any potential solicitation announcement.  The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, Little Rock, AR is seeking responsible sources for a potential contract to provide

This is to include the monthly pick-up and delivery of an average of 280 badges for personnel radiation monitoring.  This will include badges, wrist badges and ring badges.  Monthly monitoring of radiation exposure and badge usage reports will be provided on monthly bases to the Radiation Safety Officer. Thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) or Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) badges are preferred.

CAVHS requires the vendor to have software that allows for efficient tracking of these personnel radiation monitoring devices each month and provides a monthly report that is without DOB or SSN to assure privacy.  Badges should not use photographic film but use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) technology which provides greater sensitivity and a wider dynamic range.   The OSL technology permits multiple readouts to confirm reported radiation does.  Other dosimeters can only be analyzed once and film cannot be redeveloped to correct for processing errors.  Monitor badges must identify whether exposure is static or dynamic and offer a higher degree of stability than badges using photographic film.  (Comparative data on the ideal radiation dosimeters is attached.)
4.	Performance Period:  Firm-Fixed-Price based on the average usage of 280 badges per month.  The contractor shall complete the work required on a monthly bases with the appropriate software available and the monthly reports provided as directed.

<DESC><p>Special Notice:</p>
<p>Subject to final approval, The Bureau of Fiscal Service, on behalf of the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) in Washington, DC, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to Mantoni, Dr. Robert Inc, 8757 Georgia Ave, Ste 530, Silver Springs, MD 20910-4488 for Mobile Dental Services.</p>
<p>In a recent finding by Joint Commission Resources it was determined that the AFRH's in-house dental clinic does not meet all applicable Joint Commission standards. In order to allow adequate time for the AFRH to make the necessary changes to get the clinic in compliance with all Joint Commission standards, there is a need to continue the current Mobile Dental Services. It is currently unknown exactly how long it will take to get the clinic to the point of being fully operational. The resulting contract will be awarded for a base period of six (6) months with two 3-month option periods.</p>
<p>Once the in-house dental clinic is fully operational, it is the intent of the Government to issue a solicitation on a competitive basis.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Fiscal Service will consider all affirmative responses received no later than Wednesday, November 20, 2013 at 2:00 PM ET. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show how it would be advantageous to the Government to switch providers for this requirement. A request for information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to proceed with the sole source award.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<a href="mailto:barrietta.killiebrew@usace.army.mil">USACE District St. Louis</a>
<DESC>CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DAY <br> MELVIN PRICE/WOOD RIVER SEEPAGE CUT-OFF WALL PROJECT <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District will host a Construction Industry Day event on Tuesday, December 3, 2013 for all businesses interested in the Melvin Price/Wood River Seepage Cut-Off Wall Project. <br>  <br> The Melvin Price/Wood River Seepage Cut-Off Wall Project Construction Industry Day event will be held at the National Great Rivers Museum, #2 Locks and Dam Way, Alton, IL 62002.  The event is free of charge and all interested parties are invited to attend.  <br>  <br> To register, please return Registration Form (Attachment-A) by email to: <br> Barrietta.Killiebrew@usace.army.mil no later than November 26, 2013. Pre-registration is required due to potential space limitations. Attendance is limited to four (4) representatives per company.  <br>  <br>  <br> CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DAY - December 3, 2013 - Time: 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. <br> The Construction Industry Day event provides an opportunity to learn about this significant project and assist in the improvement of the Plans and Specifications.  This event provides contractors and suppliers the opportunity to take a critical look at how the project features are proposed to be laid out and allows for feedback that could result in a reduction in cost, improve constructability, reduce schedule risk, and provide firsthand experience on best practice methods. The proposed Melvin Price/Wood River Seepage Cut-Off Wall Project will involve the construction of an 8,100 lineal feet seepage cut-off wall to approximate depths of 135 to 165 feet.  The project is located adjacent to and upstream of the Melvin Price Locks and Dam in Alton, IL and will address underseepage occurring along this Wood River Levee reach.  The Construction Industry Day will include a general overview of the underseepage problem as well as the government's proposed solution to the underseepage.  Architectural renderings for conceptual project design features, such as: proposed cut-off wall alignment, subsurface conditions, design concepts, and hydrographs will be provided before the Construction Industry Day on the following link:  http://www.mvs.usace.army.mil/Missions/ProgramsProjectManagement/idmp.aspx and hardcopies will be available at the meeting.  Read ahead material will be posted by November 22, 2013.  The event will also include a question and answer workshop and one-on-one private sessions with a Government team.  To ensure a thorough understanding of the project, contractors are encouraged to view the project site prior to or the day of the event. The project site is in close proximity to the Industry Day location.  <br>  <br> Constructability Questions to Industry: The Government is seeking industry feedback on the project information and additional questions which will be provided on the previously mentioned website by November 22, 2013. <br>  <br> All interested parties, regardless of event attendance, are encouraged to voluntarily submit written responses, constructive input, or additional questions. Responses may be submitted prior to, during or after the event. Please send advance responses to Barrietta.Killiebrew@usace.army.mil. Responses are intended to initiate discussion during a facilitated, group question and answer session.  <br>  <br>  <br> One-on-one Sessions: Please indicate on the Registration Form if you would like to sign up for a one-on-one session.  Please be prepared to discuss the questions below, which will be used to guide the discussions.  These questions may be modified.  Any modifications will be posted on the previously mentioned website prior to the event.    <br>  <br>  <br> 1.	It is anticipated that funding constraints will lead to construction of the cut-off wall in phases. Is there a minimum (or maximum) length of wall we should place in a single solicitation to avoid unnecessary efficiency losses?  If so what are those limits?  Should anything else (other than cut-off wall length) be considered for the contract package?    <br>  <br> 2.	Considering cost efficiency - What is the optimum contract value needed to ensure sufficient competitive bids from qualified contractors in this industry? <br>  <br> 3.	What issues do you anticipate going through the cobble and boulder zones in the aquifer?  Drilling mud loss has been encountered in the cobble and boulder zones.  How would your firm mitigate this risk?  How should the government's specifications address cobbles and boulders to best mitigate risk and reduce contingencies in bids? <br>  <br> 4.	Are there any work platform or layout requirements not accounted for by government in the typical cross sections provided?  Is the government including work area accommodations that are unnecessary? <br>  <br> 5.	It is anticipated the cut-off wall will bisect at least two active pipelines.  We are considering use of jet grouting in these to cut-off the underseepage.  What concerns should we consider when specifying this method?  Are there other methods we should consider specifying for seepage cutoff in the area of these pipeline crossings? <br>  <br> 6.	It is anticipated that the cut-off wall will run in parallel with three utilities (one gas line and two telecommunication lines).  Care must be taken in design not to damage the existing utilities.  What range of equipment loadings should our design account for in these areas?  Are there specific methods for dealing with parallel utilities that we should consider? <br>  <br> 7.	Do you anticipate any additional problems for your operation not discussed in the preceding questions with respect to design, production, and safety/stability? <br>  <br> 8.	What other feedback would you like to provide for consideration to improve the constructability of this project? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Capability Statements: Interested parties, regardless of event attendance, are invited to submit capability statements for market research purposes and acquisition strategy planning (5-page limit). A recommended outline at Attachment-B.  Please submit capability statements to Corps Contracting Division Representatives at the event, or mail to: Contracting Division, Attn: Barrietta Killiebrew, USACE - St. Louis, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, MO 63103-2833. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> This notice does not constitute a solicitation. This announcement and the Construction Industry Day event are for planning purposes only. The acquisition strategy for this proposed project has not yet been developed.  Response to this notice is strictly voluntary. The Government will not reimburse any party attending or participating for costs incurred for this event or marketing efforts. <br>  <br> DISCLOSURE NOTIFICATION AND PROCEDURES <br>  <br> Please do not submit proprietary information.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc., a contract to complete the concrete portion of the Project Geotechnical and Concrete Materials Completion Report for - Portugues Dam in Ponce, Puerto Rico, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Construction project scheduled for completion in November 2015. The contract will be a sole-source firm-fixed price contract for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of award.  <br>  <br> Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc, possess firsthand knowledge of the project design and construction to prepare and complete the concrete materials report section of the Project Geotechnical and Concrete Materials Completion Report for Portugues Dam. The concrete mix designs for the dam were produced by Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc. Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc, also performed the batch testing of the roller compacted concrete (RCC) and conventional concrete mix designs on site and observed and logged a majority of the concrete core samples extracted from the dam. They oversaw concrete quality assurance and monitored contractor quality control and placement from initial placement in January 2011 through the topping out of the dam in May 2012. As a result, Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc has accumulated the knowledge and expertise required on this project that is not available from any other firm. <br>  <br> The proposed contract would consist of preparing and completing the concrete materials report section of the Project Geotechnical and Concrete Materials Completion Report for the Portugues Dam. The report is dependent upon the completeness and accuracy of the information contained in it. Due to the specific critical knowledge and experience required by USACE Engineering Regulation ER 1110-1-101 a concrete material engineer responsible for the original design and performance evaluation should collaborate in the report. It would be very costly to the Government, both financially and technically, to develop a new consultant's specific knowledge of the project to meet this requirement. To contract with other than Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc., would also result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In addition, to develop a new consultant's knowledge base of the project would cause a significant impact to the project delivery schedule of  November 15, 2015. <br>  <br> Interested concerns should contact Veronica S. Taylor at 904-232-2107 (or email at veronica.s.taylor@usace.army.mil) for information on submitting documentation demonstrating their qualifications to accomplish this project. Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Veronica S. Taylor at 904-232-2107. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR. <br>

<DESC>The Little Rock District Corps of Engineers (SWL) will host an Industry Day on 3 December 2013, at the Arkansas State Library Bessie B. Moore Conference Room located at 900 W Capitol Ave #100 Little Rock, AR 72201. Please note that parking is very limited in the area surrounding this facility. The purpose of this Industry Day is to conduct market research at a programmatic level to enable SWL to establish acquisition plans for Fiscal Year (FY) 14 as well as an opportunity to partner with local contractors to bolster interest in SWL's contracting requirements.
<p>There will be representatives from SWL's Contracting Office to briefly discuss upcoming FY14 contracting requirements for SWL. In addition to Contracting, there will be representatives from the District's Operations Management Office, Project Management Office and the Office of Small Business to give brief overviews of their unique requirements.</p>
<p>SWL has a vast and diverse mission that encompasses both military and civil projects. Within our geographic boundaries, SWL is responsible for operating 12 multipurpose lakes, 13 locks and dams, 308 miles of navigation on the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, 178 parks and 7 hydroelectric plants. SWL provides support to military facilities within our boundaries including Little Rock Air Force Base and Fort Chaffee as well as to customers in Texas and Oklahoma (see attached Southwest Division Map). Additionally, SWL provides worldwide support to Air Force Medical Services providing construction, A-E and supply contracting to support their mission.</p>
<p>There will be 2 sessions to accommodate all interested attendees. While attendees are able to attend both sessions, due to space and time constraints we ask that you attend only the session that best fits your interest and capabilities.</p>
<p>The first session will be held from 0830-1200 and will focus solely on SWL's operation and maintenance day-to-day requirements which may include but are not limited to park mowing, park attendants, park cleaning, boundary line maintenance, pest management, janitorial services and other services and supplies necessary to operate and maintain our park facilities. There are various services required throughout SWL (see attached SWL Map). The majority of these requirements are commercial in nature ranging from $25K - $5M. The areas of performance are generally located within a specific Project Office's Boundary and there are currently 9 Projects Offices within SWL. For example, a mowing contract for the Greer's Ferry Project Office would likely encompass all parks operated and maintained by that Project Office. A more detailed project list will be published prior to the Industry Day. SWL will provide a short briefing on the upcoming projects in this category followed by a one on one capability briefings with each company in attendance (capability briefings will be limited to a 10 minute session per company due to space and time constraints).</p>
<p>The second session will be held from 1230-1615 and will focus on upcoming construction and A-E projects supporting both the Military and Civil missions. Projects include but are not limited to Engineering Infrastructure Repair projects for Air Force Medical Services (may include international work), Aircraft Arresting System at Ft Bliss, TX, and Surveying Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. SWL will provide a briefing on the upcoming projects in these areas followed by a one on one capability briefing with each company in attendance (capability briefings will be limited to a 10 minute session per company due to space and time constraints).</p>
<p>Interested attendees are required to complete the attached "USACE-SWL FY14 Interest Statement" and return it to Alicia Moore and Marcus Mitchell at alicia.m.moore@usace.army.mil and marcus.d.mitchell@usace.army.mil respectively not later than 22 November 2013. Please complete all sections of the Interest Statement.</p>

<DESC>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder/Service Dog Study
Request for Information 

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT/ Request for Information ONLY.  It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and shall not obligate the Government to award a contract.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is for market research to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources interested and capable of performing the work and obtain their size classification relative to the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code 812910.  

A.  Background.  As directed by PL 111-84, VA is conducting a study to determine the efficacy of service dogs in the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  The study was started in late 2011 and continues for Veterans who have already been paired with a dog.
A new full and open contract competition will be conducted to obtain the best possible dogs, regardless of where the potential contract partner might be located in the U.S.  Per PL 11-84, dogs must be provided by 501(c)(3) entities. The revised study design will require both service dogs and emotional support dogs.
1. The US Department of Justice defines service dogs as "dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities."  In contrast, emotional support dogs are described as "dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support [and] do not qualify as service animals."  Although the same health, conformation, and temperament standards will be used for both types of dogs, the emotional support dogs will not have public access rights under the ADA.  Service dogs will be required to meet Assistance Dogs International (ADI) Public Access Testing criteria whereas  emotional support dogs will be required to meet the new American Kennel Club (AKC) Community Canine standard, which is an advanced extension of the AKC Canine Good Citizen testing.  
The following table provides a brief summary of the differences between service and emotional support dogs:
Accommodation Description	Service Dog
(A dog that is individually trained to perform work or tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability.) 
	Emotional Support Dog
(A dog that provides comfort or
support for a person with a 
disability, but does not have any individualized training to perform work or tasks.) 
Reasonable Accommodation in Housing? 
	Yes. Housing provider may ask for documentation that owner has a disability and there is a disability-related need for a service animal. 	Yes. Housing provider may ask for documentation that owner has a disability and there is a disability-related need for an emotional support animal. 
Reasonable Accommodation in Places of Public Accommodation and Public Entities? 	Yes. Public accommodations and public entities may not ask for documentation, but can ask if the animal is a service animal and what it is trained to do. 	No. 
Reasonable Accommodation for airline travel? 
	Yes. Airline may ask whether the animal is a service animal and what it is trained to do. 
	Yes. Airline may ask for a signed note from a licensed mental health professional, not more than 1 year old, that states that owner has a psychiatric disability and a disability-related need for an emotional support animal.
 
2. Privacy & Confidentiality.  Dogs procured will be used in a research study, which is subject to specific and strict laws and regulations regarding the privacy of Veterans enrolled in the study.  The privacy of Veterans participating in this study must be diligently protected at all times by VA contracting partners.  VA recognizes that vendor staff must be aware of general challenges faced by individuals with PTSD and understand the possible symptoms of PTSD to choose a suitable service dog and perform an effective pairing or choose an appropriate emotional support dog to facilitate successful placement, but the following restrictions will be required of any VA contracting partner:
a. Veterans in the study will not be named, featured, or pictured in any publications, press releases, web pages, text messages, or any other communications, whether verbal, written, or electronic;     
b.  Veterans in the study will not be solicited for donations, loans, or favorable considerations of any type for any vendor staff.  This prohibition includes will include promotional, monetary, or other requests by the vendor;
c.  Veterans in the study will not make personal appearances or be filmed for press or promotional purposes on behalf of the vendor or vendor staff members;
d.  Any and all external requests for information about the study or Veterans participating in the study will be referred immediately to the VA Contracting Officer.  No information about the study will be released to any third party without the written permission of the VA Contracting Officer;  
e.  Contracting partners will not be able to provide funds or resources beyond what would normally be provided to any person being paired with a service/emotional support dog;  
f. Restrictions shall remain in place until all Veterans in the study paired with dogs, from any VA contracting partner, complete the entire study period.  Thereafter, written permission shall be obtained from Veterans for any activities described above.
g. Contracting partners may not encourage Veterans to mislead the VA about how a dog is behaving or about the health status of a dog. Veterans must be encouraged to be forthright when reporting information about their dog to the VA. 
h. Veterans in study may not work for or volunteer with the contracting partner until all Veterans in the study have completed the study.
B.  Request for Information.  Both service dog and working dog organizations will be eligible to provide dogs.  VA wishes to receive input from both communities, and would much appreciate receiving the detailed information below to help make the study a success. 
1. Assuming that a defined set of tasks will be provided by VA, please provide an estimated cost for each type of dog, broken down into the following categories:

Expense 
Category	Service Dog	Emotional Support Dog
Cost of dog
(purchased 
or breeding program)

Other (please specify)		



2.  If your organization prefers a particular breed(s) of dog, please indicate the breed(s) and 	explain the rationale for the preference.

b. Assuming that a Veteran diagnosed with PTSD does not also have mobility 	challenges, list the tasks you believe to be most valuable for a person with PTSD, and 	provide a detailed description of the task(s) and how it would be expected to help them: 
8.  What process does your organization use to match a recipient/handler with a suitable   	  dog?  Please be as specific as possible.
9.  Experience.  

a.  How many years of experience does your organization have training service and/or working dogs (specify each and type)?
b.  How many years of experience does your organization have training emotional support dogs? 

c.  How many dogs (service, emotional support and/or working) has your organization placed in the last three years?

<p>L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES</p>
<p>Procedures for contractors obtaining entry authority on Malmstrom AFB: Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB may be permitted providing the contractor follows the procedures set forth below and 341 SW Pamphlet 31-103 (available at Visitor Control Center) and meets the security standards including applicable background checks. Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB will be permitted to contractor personnel who obtain proper credentials and passes through one of the two main entry points (Commercial Gate on 2nd Ave North or 10th Ave North Gate). Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are employed by your company may use their retired or dependent Armed Forces Identification Card to enter Malmstrom AFB; however, they must still obtain a contractor's pass through the Visitor's Center located outside of the Commercial gate. In the event of increased force protection conditions, retired military members and the dependents of active duty or retired military personnel without a contractor's pass, will be required to follow the security measures enacted under the respective force protection condition. Contractor's badges will be obtained in the following manner:</p>
<p>(a) First, contractor employees must already have adequate identification such as a driver's license or company ID card. This identification should include, as a minimum, the physical description of the individual (i.e., height, weight, date of birth, eye and hair color), a picture of the individual, and the individual's signature.</p>
<p>(b) Upon award of a contract, the contractor will be issued an Entry Authorization List (EAL) by the contract administrator in 341 CONS. The contractor will need to submit the required information for the EAL to the contract administrator in 341 CONS prior to contractor personnel coming to Malmstrom AFB.</p>
<p>(c) Upon initial entrance to Malmstrom AFB, contractors' personnel shall obtain a contractor's pass from the Visitor's Center where the EAL will be filed. Contractor passes will be valid for the duration of the contract. The contractor will be required to resubmit a new EAL upon exercising option years, contract renewals or extensions, and adding or subtracting names to and from the EAL.</p>
<p>(d) If contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB for time(s) outside of the performance period of the contract (i.e., administrative issues, warranty issues, site visits), they will need to be vouched on by the customer, or supporting agency, of the respective contract they are associated with.</p>
<p>(e) At the time contractors initially come to the Visitor's Center to obtain their pass, they will be required to fill out DD Form 1172, which the Visitor's Center will issue and maintain.</p>
<p>(f) It will be the sole responsibility of the contractor to renew, remove, and add employees to the EAL. In order to renew, remove or add names to the EAL the contractor must follow the same processes as if they were submitting the EAL for the first time. <br />(g) For existing contracts that are already in progress, contractors will follow the procedures mentioned above if any person(s) need a new or updated pass.</p>
<p>(h) Any other instances where contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in which the customer, or supporting agency, will need to sponsor contractor personnel entry and accompany them while on base.</p>
<p>(i) All passes must be returned to 341 SFS (Visitor Center) upon completion of the contract, or personal no longer require access to the installation, under performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(j)Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to certify in writing that your firm carries insurance on your vehicle or vehicles as outlined below:</p>
<p>i. $10,000 Property Damage Liability.<br />ii. $25,000 Personal Liability for each person.<br />iii. $50,000 Personal Liability for each accident.</p>
<p>(Note:) Each vehicle must be insured for the above limits if not already covered in your contract.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, Emerging Technologies (ACC-NJ-ET), Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, NY intends to award a sole source contract to Surface Enhancement Technologies (SET), L.L.C. of 3929 Virginia Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45227.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 332999 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.   <br>  <br> The Government has a need to purchase services that can provide Low Plasticity Burnishing (LPB ) surface treatment capable of imparting a deep layer of thermally and mechanically stable high compressive residual stress (RS) in critical locations providing improved damage tolerance and increased component life.  The technologies must be capable of enhancing the fatigue life of a large caliber cannon tube by LPB. The goal of the program will be to restore the component performance by mitigating fatigue cracking damage and stress concentrations without changing the material or physical design of the component. The target of the program shall be to restore the final safe fatigue life (FSFL) on a best effort basis. <br>  <br> The main task is to develop an LPB process for the steel cannon tube to mitigate fatigue cracking at the muzzle end.

<p>================================================================</p>
<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The first<br />four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and the<br />four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local union<br />number or district council number where applicable , i.e.,<br />Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the example, is<br />an internal number used in processing the wage determination.<br />The date, 07/01/2011, following these characters is the<br />effective date of the most current negotiated rate/collective<br />bargaining agreement which would be July 1, 2011 in the above<br />example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rates.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union majority rates,<br />LA indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>

The price will be determined fair and reasonable IAW Far Part 13.106. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ??have??, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ??Principal,?? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror??s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. <br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. <br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. <br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. <br />(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- <br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or <br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or <br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. <br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. <br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. <br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. <br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(h) Multiple awards.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other Contractors (i.e., "Associate Contractors") in order to fulfill requirements separate from the work to be performed under this contract, yet having a relationship to performance under this contract.

Nothing in this special contract requirement shall limit the Government's rights in any way under any other term of the contract, including those related to the Government's right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this contract. The substance of this special contract requirement shall be included in all subcontracts at any tier.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 H.5200.209.001 CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES (AUG 2013)</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all management, administrative, clerical, and supervisory functions required for the effective and efficient performance of this contract.</p>

<p>&bull; Discuss with unauthorized persons any information obtained in the performance of work under this contract.<br />&bull; Conduct business not directly related to this contract on Government premises.<br />&bull; Use computer systems and/or other Government facilities for company or personal business other than work related; or<br />&bull; Recruit on Government premises or otherwise act to disrupt official Government business.</p>

The Contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. Observance of such holidays by Government personnel shall not be a reason for the Contractor to request an extension of the period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract.</p>
<p>In the event the Contractor's personnel work during the holiday or other excused absences, they may be compensated by the Contractor, however, no form of holiday or other premium compensation will be considered either as a direct or indirect cost, other than their normal compensation for the time worked.

<p><strong>2.16 H.5200.222.001 "INSTRUCTIONS TO CONTRACTOR REGARDING NON-DISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS UNDER SERVICE CONTRACT ACT-AFFECTED CONTRACTS." (AUG 2013)</strong></p>
<p>(1) Background: Service contracts and subcontracts with employees who are specifically covered by the Service Contract Act subject to requirements in FAR Subpart 22.12-Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts. Applicability. FAR 52.222-17, "Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers" takes precedence, if there should be any conflict with any information in this specific contract term.<br />(A)(i)This requires successor contractors under a newly-awarded contract to offer employment on a first right of refusal to Service Contract Act-covered employees under a current contract that includes FAR 52.222-17. When a service contract (which is any contract or subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or its contractors that is covered in whole or in part concerning its requirement by the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and its implementing regulations) succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. Executive Order 13495 prohibits employment openings under the successor contract until such right of first refusal has been provided.<br /><br />(ii) Method of job offer. The successor contractor shall make job offers to current contract employees (who are covered by the Service Contract Act) as specified herein. The current contract is held by: (CONTRACTING OFFICER; INSERT NAME OF CURRENT CONTRACTOR, CONTRACT NUMBER, and OFFICIAL CONTRACTOR BUSINESS/MAILING ADDRESS). A job offer made by a successor contractor must be a bona fide express offer of employment on the contract. Each bona fide express offer made to a qualified service employee on the predecessor contract must have a stated time limit of not less than ten (10) days for an employee response. Prior to the expiration of the 10-day period, the contractor is prohibited from offering employment on the contract to any other person, subject to the exceptions at FAR 22.1203-5. Any question concerning an employee's qualifications shall be decided based upon the individual's education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee's experience on the predecessor contract, and a contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with Executive Order 13495. An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. <br />(iii)Exceptions to Job Offer requirements. (a) A successor contractor or its subcontractors are not required to offer employment to any service employee of the predecessor contractor who (1) Will be retained by the predecessor contractor. (2) The successor contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job. (See 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which this exception would or would not be appropriate.) (b) A successor contractor or its subcontractors may employ under the contract any of its current service employees who (1) have worked for the successor contractor or its subcontractors for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of the successor contract, and (2) would otherwise face lay-off or discharge. (c) The successor contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of the preceding exceptions and the exemption listed at FAR 22.1203-2(a)(5) involving nonfederal work and must provide notice of such with its proposal to the Government. <br />(B)(i) The predecessor contractor is required to furnish to the contracting officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under the contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The certified service employee lists must be provided not less than thirty (30) days before completion of the contract. The certified list must also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under the contract and subcontracts for services. The information on this list is the same as that on the seniority list required by paragraph (n) of the clause at FAR 52.222-41, "Service Contract Act of 1965." If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of FAR 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than ten (10) days prior to performance completion. The Contractor shall submit such list to: CONTRACTING OFFICER FILL IN ADDRESS. (b) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer will provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor.<br />(ii) Contractor Notification Service Employees.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />This contract is expected to be awarded on a sole source basis to Saft America Inc., however if offers are received from any other offeror, quotes will be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-2 based on the criteria listed below. Award will be made to the offeror representing the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability: Technical Acceptability will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. Part 21 of the Federal Aviation Regulation outlines certification procedures.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

The source ship has a 4" camlock fitting and can pump off at a maximum of 90 gallons/minute. The contractor must provide a truck and all the hose and connections required to receive the fuel and forward it to the receiving ship. Fuel trucks and equipment can be staged on the pier supporting the ships though necessary precautions must be taken to ensure fuel is not spilled into the adjacent marine environment. Multiple transfers shall be required, each involving an estimated 12,000-50,000 gallons, occurring through the remainder of Fiscal Year 14 (ending Sept. 30, 2014). The total number of gallons to be transferred is about 136,000 gallons. The contractor is to be appropriately certified by the USCG for over water transfers and provide qualified personnel for pumping fuel over marine water to and from ships for the state of Oregon.</p>
<p>TASK 2: POLISHING OF FUEL:<br /><br />The fuel is to be polished as it is transferred. Fuel polishing is the removal of water, sediment, non-combustible particulate matter and microbial contamination below levels stated in ASTM D975 (Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils) while re-suspending combustible particulate matter to maintain ASTM standards for BTU value, lubricity, and Cetane.</p>
<p>The primary difference between fuel polishing and fuel filtration is that fuel polishing acknowledges that fuel itself can degrade and cause solids. Fuel filters simply pull the solids out because they plug up filters whereas fuel polishers break down the combustible solids so that the fuel stays within the industry specifications.</p>
<p><br />DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE:</p>
<p>1) Transfer as above an estimated 50,000 gallons on or about 08-JAN-2014.<br />2) Transfer as above an estimated 40,000 gallons on or about 13-FEB-2014.<br />3) Transfer as above an estimated 34,000 gallons on or about 20-FEB-2014.<br />Transfer as above an estimated 12,000 gallons on or about 11-MAR-2014.</p>

<p><strong>2.3 H.5200.244.001 INTERRELATIONSHIP OF ASSOCIATE CONTRACTORS (AUG 2013)</strong></p>
<p>The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other Contractors (i.e., "Associate Contractors") in order to fulfill requirements separate from the work to be performed under this contract, yet having a relationship to performance under this contract. It is expected that contractors working under TSA contracts will have to work together under certain conditions in order to achieve a common solution for TSA. The Contractor may be required to coordinate with other such Contractor(s) through the cognizant Contracting Officer (CO) and/or designated representative in providing suitable, non-conflicting technical and/or management interface and in avoidance of duplication of effort. Information on deliverables provided under separate contracts may, at the discretion of the TSA and/or other Government agencies, be provided to such other Contractor(s) for the purpose of such work.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and an associate Contractor fail to agree upon action to be taken in connection with their respective responsibilities, each Contractor shall promptly bring the matters to the attention of the cognizant CO and furnish the Contractor's recommendations for a solution. The Contractor shall not be relieved of its obligations to make timely deliveries or be entitled to any other adjustment because of failure of the Contractor and its associate to promptly refer matters to the CO or because of failure to implement CO directions.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and Associate Contractors are required to collaborate to deliver a service; the Government will designate, in writing and prior to the definition of the task, to both Contractors, a "lead Contractor" for the project. In these cases the Associate Contractors shall also be contractually required to coordinate and collaborate with the Contractor. TSA will facilitate the mutual execution of Non-Disclosure Agreements.</p>
<p>Compliance with this Special Contract Requirement is included in the contract price and shall not be a basis for equitable adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 H.5200.237.001 NON-PERSONAL SERVICES (AUG 2013)</strong></p>
<p>"Personal services" are those in which contractor personnel would appear to be, in effect, Government employees via the direct supervision and oversight by Government employees. No personal services shall be performed under this contract. No Contractor employee will be directly supervised by a Government employee. All individual Contractor employee assignments, and daily work direction, shall be given by the applicable employee supervisor of the Contractor. If the Contractor believes any Government action or communication has been given that would create a personal services relationship between the Government and any Contractor employee, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of this communication or action.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not perform any inherently Governmental actions as defined by FAR 7.500. No Contractor employee shall hold him or herself out to be a Government employee, agent, or representative. No Contractor employee shall state orally or in writing at any time that he or she is acting on behalf of the Government. In all communications in connection with this contract, Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractor employees and specify the name of the company for which they work.

<p><strong>2.16 H.5200.222.001 "INSTRUCTIONS TO CONTRACTOR REGARDING NON-DISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS UNDER SERVICE CONTRACT ACT-AFFECTED CONTRACTS." (AUG 2013)</strong></p>
<p>(1) Background: Service contracts and subcontracts with employees who are specifically covered by the Service Contract Act subject to requirements in FAR Subpart 22.12-Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts. Applicability. FAR 52.222-17, "Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers" takes precedence, if there should be any conflict with any information in this specific contract term.<br />(A)(i)This requires successor contractors under a newly-awarded contract to offer employment on a first right of refusal to Service Contract Act-covered employees under a current contract that includes FAR 52.222-17. When a service contract (which is any contract or subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or its contractors that is covered in whole or in part concerning its requirement by the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and its implementing regulations) succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. Executive Order 13495 prohibits employment openings under the successor contract until such right of first refusal has been provided.<br /><br />(ii) Method of job offer. The successor contractor shall make job offers to current contract employees (who are covered by the Service Contract Act) as specified herein. The current contract is held by: (CONTRACTING OFFICER; INSERT NAME OF CURRENT CONTRACTOR, CONTRACT NUMBER, and OFFICIAL CONTRACTOR BUSINESS/MAILING ADDRESS). A job offer made by a successor contractor must be a bona fide express offer of employment on the contract. Each bona fide express offer made to a qualified service employee on the predecessor contract must have a stated time limit of not less than ten (10) days for an employee response. Prior to the expiration of the 10-day period, the contractor is prohibited from offering employment on the contract to any other person, subject to the exceptions at FAR 22.1203-5. Any question concerning an employee's qualifications shall be decided based upon the individual's education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee's experience on the predecessor contract, and a contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with Executive Order 13495. An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. <br />(iii)Exceptions to Job Offer requirements. (a) A successor contractor or its subcontractors are not required to offer employment to any service employee of the predecessor contractor who (1) Will be retained by the predecessor contractor. (2) The successor contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job. (See 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which this exception would or would not be appropriate.) (b) A successor contractor or its subcontractors may employ under the contract any of its current service employees who (1) have worked for the successor contractor or its subcontractors for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of the successor contract, and (2) would otherwise face lay-off or discharge. (c) The successor contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of the preceding exceptions and the exemption listed at FAR 22.1203-2(a)(5) involving nonfederal work and must provide notice of such with its proposal to the Government. <br />(B)(i) The predecessor contractor is required to furnish to the contracting officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under the contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The certified service employee lists must be provided not less than thirty (30) days before completion of the contract. The certified list must also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under the contract and subcontracts for services. The information on this list is the same as that on the seniority list required by paragraph (n) of the clause at FAR 52.222-41, "Service Contract Act of 1965." If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of FAR 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than ten (10) days prior to performance completion. The Contractor shall submit such list to: CONTRACTING OFFICER FILL IN ADDRESS. (b) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer will provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor.<br />(ii) Contractor Notification Service Employees. (a) The predecessor contractor shall provide written notice, the same or substantially the same as the model notice provided under Appendix B of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 9 to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. The written notice shall be (1) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or (2) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such delivery is via e-mail, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. <br />(2) Enforcement methods. Contractors are hereby notified that all specified enforcement methods to ensure contractor compliance with these requirements may be applied at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and as such may be specified under direction from the U.S. Department of Labor.<br />(End of special contract requirement)</p>

Brothers Elizabeth City, NC 27909 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Chad.B.Davis@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1200 Pacific Time on 11/15/ 2013</p>

<DESC>RFI 02:
<p>THIS IS AN RFI ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government is not currently seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent's expense. Small Businesses possessing the capabilities to perform the tasks below are encouraged to reply to this RFI. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any such request is issued.</p>
<p>The Air Force Civil Engineering Center and 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron is conducting market research that will be used to develop an acquisition strategy for the successful award of several Air Force Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to perform construction services.</p>
<p>The government is contemplating issuance of two solicitations: Worldwide Engineering and Construction (WE&amp;C) is anticipated to be solicited as full and open competition with the possibility for a partial Small Business set-aside; Regional Engineering and Construction (RE&amp;C) is anticipated to be solicited as a Small Business set-aside with the possibility for further SB sub-category set-asides and / or full and open competition. Participation in the RFI process is important in that it makes Air Force decision-makers aware of the capabilities that exist in the market. Your response is a key factor in the development of an acquisition strategy for the subject of this RFI.</p>
<p>Feel free to review the PDF version of this questionnaire if you would like to see the whole questionnaire before taking the on-line version. Responses will be collected via the online questionnaire only. DO NOT submit the PDF document in response to the RFI request. Attached are the DRAFT Scope of Work (SOW) for WE&amp;C and RE&amp;C as a reference. At this time the government is not entertaining questions/comments on the Draft SOWs, RFI #3 will be posted via FBO later this week to solicit questions/comments on the Draft SOWs. Also, included is a map for the anticipated regions on the RE&amp;C contracts. <br /><br />If unable to complete this questionnaire in one sitting, you will need to close the questionnaire window and re-open the questionnaire link to edit your response. The questionnaire will start from the beginning, but will show the responses previously entered. This only works if returning to the questionnaire from the original computer (IP address) used initially. All responses are collected based on IP addresses; only one response per IP address is permitted. This edit process will not work if you try to use a different computer to complete your response.</p>
<p>Data collected will become the property of the Air Force, and will be used to provide us with insight on current construction industry practices, experience, and capabilities. The data collected will not be shared with any entity outside of the Air Force. This questionnaire is being administered for the Air Force by third-party contractor Monterey Consultants, Inc. Monterey has signed Non-Disclosure Agreements in place and is restricted under Organizational Conflict of Interest clauses from sharing submitted information with any party except the Air Force. Monterey is not engaged in this industry and does not plan on doing business within this area in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Neither AFCEC or 772 ESS claim or suggest participation in this questionnaire will result in consideration, or award of a federal contract. Participation in the questionnaire is entirely voluntary and non-participation will not affect the Air Force's consideration of any company for future federal contracts. <br /><br />All interested contractors should respond to this questionnaire by 15 November 2013 by 1700 hrs CST. This questionnaire is internet-based, and does not require any special equipment or software beyond a typical web browser capable computer. To participate, visit the following website: www.mcix.com/AFCEC3</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Amendment 01 is attached to respond to Offeror's questions.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The purpose of this action is to upload/post the BAA solicitation itself; the original presolicitation notice is below.&nbsp; The actual due date for Formal Research Proposals is January 29, 2014.<br /><br />____________________________________________________________<br /><br />Presolicitation Notice<br />INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research on the implementation of collaborative care with the goal of eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in access to, and use of, mental health services.</p>
<p>The NIMH, Office for Research on Disparities and Global Mental Health (ORDGMH), plans to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under the provisions of FAR 35.016 and FAR 6.102(d)(2), to support research on innovative strategies for the implementation, in multiple urban and rural locations, of collaborative care interventions that have shown effectiveness in the reduction of mental health care disparities.</p>
<p>This new BAA initiative will solicit proposals that focus on a single research topic entitled: "TESTING INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COLLABORATIVE CARE FOR MANAGEMENT OF MENTAL DISORDERS AND REDUCTION OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE"</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</span></strong></p>
<p>The specific aims of this initiative are to:<br />1. Develop implementation models that will enable rigorous and sustained delivery of collaborative care for the management of mood and anxiety disorders in individuals ages 18 and older in a range of community service settings found across the United States (e.g. social service organizations, faith-based organizations, human services settings, primary care clinics);</p>
<p>2. Test the feasibility and effectiveness of the implementation model in communities with substantial racial and ethnic minority populations; and</p>
<p>3. Assess the implementation model's overall impact on achieving increased access to and use of indicated mental health care services for racial and ethnic minority populations, compared to implementation as usual.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OVERVIEW</span></strong></p>
<p>This is a Presolicitation Notice in advance of the Request for Proposal (RFP), and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. Solicitation no. BAA-HHS-NIDA(MH)-13-038, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offeror's proposal, will be available electronically on or about October 10, 2013 and will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper copies will be available.</p>
<p>This BAA will utilize a 4-step process to include: <br />Step 1 - Technical Dialog <br />Step 2 - White Paper Submission <br />Step 3 - Formal Research Proposals; and <br />Step 4 - Potential Award(s)</p>
<p>This BAA utilizes a multi-step process for organizations contemplating submission of a Formal Research Proposal which allows for an early feedback of the potential NIMH interest in a proposed study, based on technical merit, applicability to the NIMH mission and projected funding. Offerors are strongly encouraged to participate in the Technical Dialog period and to submit White Papers, but this is not required.</p>
<p>The steps will be explained in detail in the RFP.</p>
<p>The BAA RFP will have a section which details the NIMH Research Objectives for this initiative. The RFP will not have a Statement of Work as in a typical research solicitation, and it is the responsibility of the offeror to propose a Statement of Work in the Formal Research Proposal.</p>
<p>The Technical Dialog Period begins with the issuing of the solicitation and closes when White Papers are due. White Paper will be due on or about November 17, 2013, and Formal Research Proposals will be due on or about January 17, 2014. The RFP will specify the exact dates. All communications prior to award of this contract shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) multi-year, cost-reimbursement, completion contract award will be made for a period not-to-exceed five (5) years, beginning on or about July 25, 2014. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.</p>
<p>The NIMH estimates that the average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) is up to $6 million per year (total up to $30.0 million for 5 years). However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award may vary depending upon the scope and technical approach to the project. The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed 5 years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NIMH.</p>

<CONTACT>Randy W. Meadows, Contract Manager, Phone 423-751-2429, Email rwmeadows@tva.gov
<DESC>November 1, 2013
<p>QUALIFICATION CERTIFICATION FOR ENGINEER PROCURE CONSTRUCT (EPC) CONTRACT FOR A NATURAL GAS FIRED NEW GENERATION PROJECT (TVA CT/CC Project)</p>
<p><br />In the near future, TVA may be issuing a solicitation document to request proposals from experienced firms for the award of an EPC contract for a Natural Gas Fired New Generation Project (the TVA CT/CC Project) on a firm, fixed price basis. In addition to the required primary proposal on a fixed price basis, the offeror may also submit an alternate proposal methodology for an optional commercial approach. The alternate proposal may address such alternate commercial terms where the offeror believes there is commercial benefit to TVA.</p>
<p>The detailed scope of work will be defined for the TVA CT/CC Project, and will be provided in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to all those prospective offerors that certify they meet the Mandatory Minimum Qualifications and submit detailed supporting documentation to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements. Any solicitation for the TVA CT/CC project will be subject to TVA obtaining the appropriate internal project approvals, environmental reviews, etc., and TVA does not commit to award a contract under this solicitation or to pay any costs incurred in the development and submission of any subsequent proposal.</p>
<p>Description of the Scope of Work for the TVA CT/CC Project</p>
<p>The TVA CT/CC project will be either a 4xCT Simple Cycle plant or a 3X1 CC (duct fired) plant located in the Tennessee Valley area. For both possible scenarios, the CTs will be natural gas fired with the possibility of backup fuel oil and will additionally include bypass stacks with diverter dampers. For the Simple Cycle CT scenario, the CTs will be engineered and constructed to allow for future conversion to Combined Cycle operation at a later date by others. TVA will provide all of the CTs (GE frame 7FA Series 5) and the Generator Step Up Transformers, as well as a 450 MW steam turbine, if required for the CC scenario. The EPC contractor will be responsible for all of the engineering, procurement, construction, and startup for the project. EPC procurements to potentially include: HRSGs, condenser, cooling tower, boiler feed pumps, circ water pumps, DCS control system, high energy piping, electrical switchgear, generator breakers, natural gas conditioning equipment, etc. The requirement of this project is to have the plant operating and in-service by early to mid 2017, depending upon the final scope.</p>
<p>Kiewit Power Engineers Company (Kiewit) has previously developed a technical specification for TVA's use for simple cycle and combined cycle projects which TVA intends to use as the technical specification in the RFP for the selected project. Even though an organizational conflict of interest may arise therefrom, in order to encourage submissions from the most qualified firms TVA will not exclude Kiewit from a possible subsequent award of an EPC contract for the project should TVA decide to move forward therewith, provided that Kiewit agrees not to withhold information developed during the preparation of the specification from TVA or place any restriction on the ability of TVA to fully disclose such information to other prospective offerors for such follow-up work. Kiewit has also committed that none of its personnel, employees, agents or contractors that participated in the development of that specification will participate in any manner in the development of its proposal in connection with a TVA project that utilizes that specification.</p>
<p>An "organizational conflict of interest" is a situation in which because of other activities or relationships with others, an offeror/contractor is unable or potentially unable to render impartial advice or assistance to TVA, or its objectivity in performing contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or it has an unfair competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, TVA reserves the right to take such steps as it deems appropriate to neutralize or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest on the part of offerors, contractors, subcontractors, or their affiliates. Kiewit will not participate in the review or evaluation of any proposals from offerors and was not involved in the development of the commercial specification.</p>
<p>Since the Simple Cycle CT scenario must be developed with a combined cycle project conversion in mind, TVA desires to select a firm with a history of successful EPC experience with combined cycle generation projects that are similar to the workscope described above and in the enclosure entitled Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification. As stated above, in order to receive the RFP, TVA requires that all prospective respondents meet these requirements before being further considered. Accordingly, all prospective respondents must first certify compliance with the requirements contained on the Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification and submit detailed supporting documentation to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements. Only the firms which TVA confirms meet all of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements will receive a copy of the RFP and will be invited to attend a mandatory pre-proposal meeting. No challenges will be accepted to TVA's decision.</p>
<p>In order to be considered, I must receive the enclosed Certification signed by an official authorized to bind the organization and supporting information at the address shown below no later than 12 noon EST, November 14, 2013.</p>

<p>Three (3) copies of the Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification and detailed supporting documentation to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements must be submitted in 3-ring notebooks as well as two (2) CDs of the Certification submittal for ease of information dissemination and review.</p>
<p>Electronic communications shall be in a form compatible with MicroSoft&reg; Office 2007.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR. RESPONSE DATE:  December 5, 2013. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc., a contract to complete the concrete portion of the Project Geotechnical and Concrete Materials Completion Report for - Portugues Dam in Ponce, Puerto Rico, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Construction project scheduled for completion in November 2015. The contract will be a sole-source firm-fixed price contract for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of award.   <br>    <br>  Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc, possess firsthand knowledge of the project design and construction to prepare and complete the concrete materials report section of the Project Geotechnical and Concrete Materials Completion Report for Portugues Dam. The concrete mix designs for the dam were produced by Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc. Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc, also performed the batch testing of the roller compacted concrete (RCC) and conventional concrete mix designs on site and observed and logged a majority of the concrete core samples extracted from the dam. They oversaw concrete quality assurance and monitored contractor quality control and placement from initial placement in January 2011 through the topping out of the dam in May 2012. As a result, Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc has accumulated the knowledge and expertise required on this project that is not available from any other firm.  <br>    <br>  The proposed contract would consist of preparing and completing the concrete materials report section of the Project Geotechnical and Concrete Materials Completion Report for the Portugues Dam. The report is dependent upon the completeness and accuracy of the information contained in it. Due to the specific critical knowledge and experience required by USACE Engineering Regulation ER 1110-1-101 a concrete material engineer responsible for the original design and performance evaluation should collaborate in the report. It would be very costly to the Government, both financially and technically, to develop a new consultant's specific knowledge of the project to meet this requirement. To contract with other than Tatro-Hinds Advance Concrete Engineering Inc., would also result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In addition, to develop a new consultant's knowledge base of the project would cause a significant impact to the project delivery schedule of  November 15, 2015.  <br>    <br>  Interested concerns should contact Veronica S. Taylor at 904-232-2107 (or email at veronica.s.taylor@usace.army.mil) for information on submitting documentation demonstrating their qualifications to accomplish this project. Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Veronica S. Taylor at 904-232-2107. RESPONSE DATE:  December 5, 2013. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR.  <br>

<AWARDEE>USRA 10211 Wincopin Cir 500 Columbia MD 21044-3405
<DESC>This sub-task is for the identification and development of structural health monitoring techniques related to conducting spin experiments on subscale turbine engine rotor like disks and performing analytical calculations to verify and correlate test results into meaningful relations in attempt to develop physics based model for crack detections methodology.  Additionally, vibration based health monitoring under both global and local approaches for monitoring critical rotor components is to be investigated. The local approach is limited to monitoring a rotating rotor while utilization of sensors that ride-on-the-spinning disk. Under local approach, piezoelectric patches, attached directly to the structure of interest (e.g., the spinning disk), can be used for passive listening (i.e., acoustic emissions), active ultrasonics (i.e., pulse/receive), as well as for impedance based structural health monitoring (SHM). Data from blade displacement sensors are to be used to follow changes in the rotor systems dynamic response.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Hospital Equipment Sales & Services is a small business company with sole representation and authorized dealer of Hill Rom as an authorized Master distributor to sell and service government accounts in Puerto Rico.  The Hill-Rom beds are considered specialized equipment; the preventive maintenance and repairs can be conducted only by the manufacturer or their Authorized Distributors due to their electronic features and certification requirements.  In addition, their past performance training and expertise over the last years as the company that has provided service and repair of all beds at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System, has proven their capabilities and service to perform this contract.
Having a contract in place with this vendor, will permit that preventive maintenance be conducted promptly and shall minimize  the need for recurring repairs providing cost benefits to the Facility rather than issuing emergency requests when the need arises, as done in the past.  This contract will also reduce the downtime for repairs.
Accordingly, Hospital Equipment Sales & Services is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. 
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: Hospital Equipment Sales & Services is the sole represented of Hill Rom in Puerto Rico, "see attached memo".  Therefore, no additional offers were solicited from other potential sources.
?
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated price to the Government is based on a yearly cost analysis during the past months.  The total dollar amount of purchase orders to Hospital Equipment for bed service's repairs has been for $65,010.00. The total amount in labor cost has been $6,125.00. The total cost in spare parts has been $58,885 ($44,226 has been paid in new motors (each motor cost $1,053*) remaining; $14,659 was other spare parts). Motors are the most expensive and most common part that requires replacement. Total Cost value for the year $80,074.00 VA Caribbean Healthcare System will pay any spare part that is priced over $700.00. Every month, some type of service repair is needed to ensure beds are working properly and safely for our VACHS' patients. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Hospital Equipment Sales & Services is the exclusive Hill-Rom master distributor and dealer in Puerto Rico; only source capable and trained to provide service to Hill-Rom Total Care Assist and Tri-Flex, and Bariatric beds. Other companies that provide repairs and service to patient beds which may be small business available in Puerto Rico, are not authorized, trained nor certified to work on Hill-Rom beds.  This puts in jeopardy and warranty or parts that may be needed.  
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: Their past performance over the last five (5) years as the company that provided service and repair of all beds at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System, has proven their capabilities and service to perform this contract. These beds are costly and complex; they need specialized care for inspection, cleaning, adjusting, repairing and calibration of all components necessary.
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above.
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  No additional actions have been taken based on the rationale provided above. 

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>This is a limited sources justification for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 8.405-6(a)(B), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is 10694F1057. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-58. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611430 with a small business size standard of $10 million dollars. This requirement is a Small Business set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit quotes. <br /><br />The Department of State requires the following: <br />The mission of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) is to provide a safe, secure environment for the conduct of US diplomacy. DS is the law enforcement and security bureau/entity for the US Department of State. In furtherance of this mission, one of the goals of the DS Training Center (DSTC) is to provide training to Foreign Service National Investigators (FSNIs) to enhance their ability to perform their duties and responsibilities. All FSNIs are locally hired investigators who work directly for the Regional Security Office (RSO).
<p>The FSNI Basic Course (OT-510) is a 12 day class, with a maximum of 24 students, that serves as introductory training for newly hired FSNIs. It is usually offered three or four times per fiscal year. The FSNI In Service Course (OT-515) is a 5 day class, with a maximum of 24 students, that provides advanced training for FSNIs that have been so employed for at least 5 years. It is usually offered two to three times per fiscal year. The In Service course provides new training that builds upon skills the FSNIs learned in the Basic course. Both courses could be held more or less often depending upon the Department's needs. Curriculum updates may lengthen or shorten the currently proposed training segments. All training is conducted at the Diplomatic Security Training Center (DSTC) in Dunn Loring, VA, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The DSTC has an immediate and ongoing need to prepare FSNIs from posts around the world to effectively interview and investigate Locally Employed Staff (LES) and Third Country Nationals (TCNs). These interviews cover pre-employment background investigations, security certifications, periodic re-certifications, and investigations of criminal and security incidents. FSNIs primarily interview foreign nationals and not US Government employees or family members that are US citizens with national security clearances. Therefore, this training needs to take into account the various factors affecting these interviews such as applicable local laws, State Department regulations, and behavioral science that incorporate the impact of cultural differences due to the local or regional customs, practices, and religious and political influences.<br />(See attached Statement of Work)</p>
<p>In addition to providing pricing for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. In this requirement a letter of authorization from the reseller demonstrating your firm is an active authorized reseller of the product required must be included with all offers, only offers from the manufacturer or authorized resellers as demonstrated by an official letter from manufacturer or other proof as available will be required to be included with submission to be considered for this opportunity. Also, please provide pictures of the products being requested for this requirement.</p>
<p>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to FAR 4.1102 and other applicable regulations and guidelines. Information can be found at www.sam.gov.<br />All Quotes must be valid for 30 days from the closing date for this solicitation. No exceptions or qualifications.</p>
