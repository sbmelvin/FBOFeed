<DESC><p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT SCHRIEVER AFB CIVIL ENGINEERING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES CONTRACT (CEOMS) (FA2550-02-C-0004). <br /><br />This synopsis provides notification of the 50th Contracting Squadron's intent to negotiate and award a fixed-price order, on a sole-source basis, under an existing contract, FA2550-02-C-0004, entitled "Civil Engineering Operations and Maintenance Services" (CEOMS). This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.<br /><br />This project, 50 CES Work Order 1037517, is entitled "Install Steam Flow Meters." It will be funded through the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act of 2009. The work required falls squarely within the scope of the CEOMS contract. The CEOMS Contractor is Aleut Global Solutions, LLC, located at 7222 Commerce Center Drive, Suite 255; Colorado Springs, CO 80919. The CEOMS contract was awarded in 2002 as a competitive, 8(a) set-aside for civil engineering operations and maintenance services for the operations facilities at Schriever AFB, including the associated systems infrastructure. CEOMS contract services include operation, maintenance, repair, incidental construction, test and inspection of all installed Real Property (RP) and Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) to include Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems, electrical distribution systems, lightning protection, facility water systems, sanitary sewer systems and solid state uninterrupted power systems (SSUPS). The contract type is Fixed Price Incentive Fee.<br /><br />Description of Work to be Accomplished: Steam and condensate flow meters will be installed on the supply and return lines that service our reimbursable tenants and our Air Force real properties. These meters will be connected to the meter monitoring system. Schriever AFB currently experiences low condensate return to its boiler system. This low flow creates a costly need to condition cold make-up water and introduce it back into the boilers. This project will (1) measurably reduce the expense of conditioning and heating the cold water, and (2) will enable base tenants to receive billings based on measured flow as opposed to the current costly and time-consuming engineering estimate system.
<p>The Period of Performance for this requirement will be from the award date through 30 September 2009.&nbsp; The NAICS code for this procurement is 561210 and the annual size standard is $35.5 Million. The estimated, maximum dollar value for this task order is $400,000.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the subject work order will be placed on contract approximately 5 days from the date of this notice.</p>

[Described Above].  Teh statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2). The regulatory authority is 41 USC 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-, Unusual and compelling urgency.  The Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis.  GFSC currently uses teh IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) Baseline approval list for server specifications.  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to teh server requested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility.  It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of approved servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list.  Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchagneable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance therby reducing administrative adn operatinoal overhead when maintenance is required. By not continuing to use Hewlett Packard servers and parts GFSC would incur additional administrative and operational overhead to support different vendor hardware (i.e. differet hardware configurations, different base installation/bios/hardware anamolies, etc.) GFSC maintains three separate server farms, production, development, and continuity of operations. In support of these environments, we maintain an inventory of onsite spare parts; disk drives, network adapters, chassis and cpu fants etc. By restricting our servers to a minimial number of models and manufacturers across these three server farms, we leverage the availability of spare parts for these mission critical assets at the minimial cost to the government. Similarly this configuration control gives us the ability to rapidly replace and provision serves in the three environments utilizing server software imaging thechnology, as the source and target systems contain the same hardware. This capability is crucial to our effective remote administration of our continuity of operations facility located 575 miles away.<BR><BR>

This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing maintenance and sustainment services for the Weather and Radar Processor (WARP) program.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541990, "All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services", with a size standard of $7.0M.

2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the water distribution, and wastewater collection systems for the North Dakota Air Guard Base (ANGB) located at Hector IAP, to the City of Fargo.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. The City of Fargo (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract The 119th Wing, North Dakota Air National Guard (NDANG), is headquartered at Hector IAP in Fargo, ND on the north. Hector ANG contains approximately 62 facilities within its 255 acre area.  The normal base population is approximately 290 personnel; however, twice a month during drills the population surges to 920. The water distribution system at the Hector ANGB, is composed of 36,500 LF of pipe.  Primary water pipe (24,300 LF) is 8-inch PVC which was installed in 1988.  The older pipe is 4-inch ductile iron (installed in 1952) and 8-inch transite (installed in 1976).  All pipe is buried a minimum of eight feet.  There are 35 fire hydrant assemblies (fire hydrant plus associated valves); 32 were installed in 1990 and three were installed in 1998.  Most are on 8-inch mains. There is one post indicator valve (installed in 1985) and there are no exterior backflow prevention valves, cathodic protection, storage tanks, wells, reservoirs, spare parts, or specialized equipment.  Overall operating pressure is 50 psig and the average monthly consumption is 0.26 million gallons. There are multiple entry points along this looped system.  Five are along the south base boundary on Old Airport Road and two are on the east boundary along University Road.  There is no master meter; each of the buildings with water service has its own individual water meter owned by the City of Fargo.  The city reads the meters and submits a consolidated monthly bill.  This privatization effort does not include these city owned meters. The wastewater collection system at the Hector ANGB, is composed of approximately 18,000 LF of pipe.  Primary pipe (approximately 12,750 LF) is 8-inch PVC, which was installed in 1988.  The oldest pipe is 8-inch clay tile, installed in 1963. All pipe is buried at a minimum of eight feet and there are approximately 43 manholes.  These manholes are on 8-inch mains.  Thirty-five are pre-cast concrete and 8 are cast in place concrete.  There is no cathodic protection, wastewater treatment plant, spare parts or specialized equipment.  There is a single base entry point near buildings 310 and 360 with a base exit point near building 420. There are two lift stations on the base.  The lift stations have automatic controls and a visible alarm light.  They are currently supported by a government-owned, auxiliary generator, which also supports the alert complex.  When the wastewater collection system is privatized, the government will no longer be responsible for providing emergency backup power for the lift stations.  There is no master meter; buildings have individual water meters and the monthly sanitary sewer charge is included in the water bill from the City of Fargo. Not included in this privatization effort are the city owned water meters.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2000 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution and collection systems, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact MSgt Lee Gunderson, email lee.gunderson@ndfar.ang.af.mil.<BR><BR>Places of Performance Location: 119th WG, Hector Air National Guard Base, Fargo North Dakota<BR>Country:    USA

<CONTACT>Elizabeth A. Corder (805) 832-4012
<DESC>The Specialty Center Acquisitions NAVFAC, Code AQ00, intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) contract to Stateside Associates, Inc., for environmental legislative and regulatory monitoring services.  The resulting contract will not exceed a period of 90 days.  The services are being procured on behalf of Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NAVFAC ESC), Port Hueneme, California, 93043.  /The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561499, All Other Business Support Services.  The services that will be procured are available only from Stateside Associates, Inc.  The Department of Defense (DOD) has a need to monitor developing state level legislation and regulations, identify laws and rules that could impact DOD operations and, where appropriate, to articulate DOD needs and concerns to legislative and regulatory bodies.  Jurisdictions of interest include the fifty (50) sta! tes and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, intrastate environmental regulatory or rulemaking organizations such as local or regional air pollution control districts, and water quality management districts in states where these exist and have autonomous rulemaking authority.  /This procurement is being processed in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The legislative and regulatory reporting information is required in formats that include a Microsoft Access database, with a specific data structure.  That Contractor provided database serves as a "back end" for Navy, Air Force, and Army "front end" databases reliant on the back end structure.   The front end databases serve as part of DOD Regional Environmental Coordinators' business process for managing the legislative and regulatory information, as well as tracking actions and follow-up.  /The requirement outlined in this PWS is complimentary to previous tasks c! ompleted under a prior contract, N47408-03-D-8411.  This is the third SAP interim contract that will be issued to provide mission critical services to the DoD.  The first and second 90 day SAP contracts were issued with the expectation that it would be of long enough duration to provide services while the GAO protest was being resolved on the preceding IDIQ contract.  The protest still has not been resolved necessitating a third 90 day SAP contract be awarded.  Any other Contractor wishing to perform this requirement would have to develop both the Access database, and an internal data handling system to populate the database, and it would have to populate the database with information about all the ongoing regulatory and legislative proposals currently active in the fifty states and territories that apply to the DOD.  The development of such a database and the time required to retrieve the required information to fill the database would not only be extremely time-consuming (estimate is one month minimum), but it would be prohibitively expensiv! e, because the services ordered through this GAP coverage contract are for such a brief period of time.  The Contractor selected for award of this contract will only be providing up to 3 months worth of services for the DOD.  Three months of service-generated revenue would not be enough for a Contractor to recoup the associated costs of the database development and required information retrieval.  As such, it would not be profitable for Contractors that do not currently have this database structure and the required information already in place to perform the work.  The services being procured will reach back to the environmental issues being tracked for the DOD under the previous contract.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Inquiries regarding this posting should be directed to Elizabeth Corder, (805) 982-4012, Elizabeth.Corder@navy.mil .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Designer
FOR THE BIRCH BAYH U.S. COURTHOUSE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA

Architect Engineer Services Solicitation #GS05P05GBC0001 Indianapolis, Indiana

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in adaptive reuse architecture, historic preservation, mechanical and electrical engineering. Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Professional Services are required for the preservation, modernization and renovation of the Birch Bayh Courthouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. 

Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the GSA Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values.  As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED-EB certified. 

The facility, designed by Rankin and Kellogg and built in 1905, is 459,121gross square feet and contains 373,876 rentable square feet. The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is located in the heart of downtown Indianapolis, at 46 East Ohio Street. The project proposes to replace the roof, the flashing, and downspouts; upgrade the windows; upgrade toilet rooms to meet ADA and provide major alterations to mechanical, electrical, life safety, and plumbing systems, at the Birch Bayh U.S. Courthouse.  The project also includes preservation of many of the building’s historic mosaics, frescoes, and murals.  

The Estimated Construction Cost range of the project is $35 million to $45 million.  The scope of work may include, but is not limited to, the following: survey of the existing conditions; detail scope verification; presentations for client and historic preservation agencies; energy conservation analysis; complete architectural and engineering design; preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents; value engineering; cost analysis; post construction contract services (PCCS); record drawings and construction phase A-E inspection services; and other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional facility. Throughout the design process, the selected A-E will assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the Congressionally mandated cost limitation for the project. The construction contract is envisioned to be procured through a source selection process that will incorporate a base contract and options for those elements of work that can be executed within the congressionally mandate cost limitation. Drawings shall be created and submitted in native AutoCAD, latest release. Drawings created in other CAD programs and then translated into AutoCAD are not acceptable. Formatting for electronic drawings shall be per GSA standards. Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in the latest MSOffice edition available at the time of contract award. The firm/joint venture shall update software versions at their own expense. 

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In STAGE I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the Lead Designer and/or Design Firm. In STAGE II, short-listed firms will be interviewed. 

STAGE I: The first stage will establish the architectural capabilities of the  Lead Designer. The A/E Firm as used in the RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The mechanical/electrical engineering requirements are a large portion of the total scope of this project but those disciplines will be evaluated in phase II. In the first stage, a short list minimum of three (3) A-E design firms will be selected for continuation into the second phase. The short list will be based on the A-E design firms’ submittal in response to this request for qualification (RFQ). The A-E design firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver design excellence in judicial design, historic preservation, and renovation of large complex projects, and will express its design approach and philosophy. The documentation will be in an 8 ½” x 11” format.  The assembled Stage 1 portfolio should be no more than 1/2” thick..

Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:    (1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%): The A-E design firm shall submit graphics (maximum of five pages per project) of five (5) relevant projects completed with the past 10 years. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including tangible evidence where possible i.e. certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. Demonstrating design excellence) and discuss, if relevant, how the historic preservation, working in an occupied facility, and other design constraints were satisfied by the design solution. 2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the lead designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy as it relates to this project, approach to public architecture, the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues and parameters that may apply specifically to the modernization of historic buildings with the focus on the unique aspects of installing state-of-the-art and flexible utility systems in historic buildings. (3) LEAD PORTFOLIO (25%): Submit a written description (maximum of one page per project) and graphics ( (maximum of three per project) of up to three (3) relevant designs completed within the past ten years attributable to the lead designer.

STAGE II: The short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team.  The SF 330 may be obtained from http://www.gsa.fov.forms.far.htm. The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  

The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the design team’s understanding of the unique aspects of the project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance plan.    Responses to the evaluation criteria and interview questions will be used to rank the A/E Teams.

This selection is open to A/E design firms within the United States. When developing the project team required for Stage II, at least 35% of the design effort (including working drawings) must be performed within the designated geographical area (state of Ohio). In Stage II of the selection process, the short-listed A/E design firms are required to demonstrate how this will be accomplished. Stage II: Following short listing, the successful offerors shall submit SF 330 for their entire project team.. Continuity of key personnel for the duration of the project will be essential. It is not necessary to re-submit information submitted in Phase I. GSA will establish the date these submittals are due and will provide new selection criteria for the interviews and final selection. The turnaround for the submission of the SF 330’s will be within 5 weeks of the short listed firm’s notification. This serves as notice to all interested firms that interviews will be conducted promptly after receipt of SF 330s: GSA plans to interview the short-listed firms in Chicago at a time and place to be determined and described in the shortlist notification. All firms need to be cognizant that an award is scheduled for April 2005. The contract for AE services will be awarded pending availability of funds.

Seq., the A-E will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small woman-owned, HUBZone small business and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the contract. The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the Stage II Form 330 will be reflected in a Subcontracting Plan which will be included in the contract. The detailed plan is required to be submitted. Each individual firm will determine the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals for this project. A small business criterion for each category is based on the contractor’s average annual receipts for the proceeding three fiscal years. Contact your local SBA office for further information.

<DESC>The Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 09-001, identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for research and/or exploratory development.  This BAA is conducted using full and open competition.  In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation, and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 31 March 2011.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 3 April 2011. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups:  1. Medical Modeling, Simulation and Mission Support; 2. Warfighter Performance; 3.  Behavioral Sciences and Epidemiology; 4. Deployment Health Research; 5. Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program; 6. Respiratory Diseases Research; 7. Medical Science; 8. Biomedical Translational Initiative; 9. Warfighter Systems Technologies; 10. Advanced Technology; 11. Navy environmental Health Effects Laboratory; 12. Navy Directed Energy Bio-Effects Lab; 13. Naval Submarine Medical Research Lab; 14. Naval Aerospace Medical Lab; and 15. Clinical Decision Support and Healthcare Interoperability Technologies.  All technical questions may be directed to the respective technical/administrative POC listed under each technical area of interest on the BAA.  THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THE BAA SOLICITATION.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that are capable of manufacturing  M935 Fuzes - used in both 60mm and 81mm HE Mortar cartridges.<BR><BR>The Government anticipates soliciting offerors for award of multiple Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to deliver the United States Army and Marine Corps FY10-FY19 M935 Fuze production requirements.  It is anticipated that multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded for a basic period of five years with an option that may be exercised to extend each contract for an additional five year period. Potential contractors possessing the technical, financial and facility resources necessary to meet the Governments requirements will initially be qualified by being awarded an IDIQ contract and then compete for delivery orders as requirements arise.  All respondents to this market survey should show they have certification to receive export-controlled technical data (including drawings restricted by Distributions Statement D) and must have facilities with sufficient safety clearance to handle hazard classifications (i.e. 1.3G). The TDP for this fuze is approved for distribution to U.S. contractors only.  Export restrictions apply.  Additional information can be requested from Larry Leahy, CCRC-AM, (309) 782-3723, email lawrence.leahy1@us.army.mil.  Send requests for TDP to Mr. Leahy at the above email address.  Your request shall include a certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Data Agreement or your JCP number, company name, POC, address and phone number. If you would like the TDP CD to be sent to you via FEDEX, please provide your companys FEDEX number.<BR><BR><BR>REQUIREMENTS:  For the purposes of this survey, monthly requirements fall into the general range of 20,000/month.  <BR><BR>Interested contractors should demonstrate that they possess the experience, capability, necessary equipment, facilities, and tooling required, or that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble, test, and inspect the required quantities of M935 Fuzes per the requirements identified above.  This may include an indication of willingness to invest in setting up a required production line.  Contractors shall provide a summary of their companys capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities, a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, test capability, personnel, past experience as a manufacturer, proven monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements and whether the company is a large or small business.  Summary descriptions of capability should address specific critical processes in the production of these legacy fuzes.  Intended line capacities (existing or planned) for the fuze should be identified at both a single shift rate and a maximum (3-shift) rate.<BR><BR>ESTIMATED PRICES:  Rough order of magnitude estimates should be provided addressing costs for the fuze.<BR><BR>This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government.  All information submitted will be held as contractor proprietary data.  The contractor shall provide all information requested in this notification within 30 days of this publication by electronic mail at no cost to the Government, to Mr. Larry Leahy at lawrence.leahy1@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.<BR><BR><BR>

This is a design-build project.  <BR><BR>Additional Requirements:  The contractor shall be licensed to conduct business in the State of Qatar or demonstrate the ability to be licensed at contract award and will comply with the laws and regulations of the State of Qatar to become licensed.  Plans and Specifications:  Two (2) sets of the solicitation will be issued on compact disk (CD) to prime contractors at no cost.  The solicitation will not be provided to subcontractors, suppliers, vendors or plan rooms.   The solicitation will not be available over the internet.

<DESC>NUCLEAR MEDICINE (ChemoShield CS600)1. Introduction: The VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS) intends to buy and install a ChemoShield Barrier isolator (negative pressure) on the Nuclear medicine Dept. located on Calle Casia # 10 San Juan PR 00921.This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number VA248-09-RQ-0387. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) will follow the Veterans Administration socio economic goals Service Disabled Veteran Owned small Business and Veteran Owned Small Business etc. lowest price technically acceptable will be used.  Veteran Administration Caribbean System (VACHS) requests a proposal for the buying, installation, testing, and acceptance of the ChemoShield and related equipment see material list as described in the Technical Specifications section of this document from invited vendors.  Prices quoted shall be all-inclusive and represent complete installation. The Bidder shall be responsible for all parts, labor and all other associated apparatus necessary to complete installation, test, and turn-over for acceptance to the VACHS the ChemoShield and the other materials listed. Include and supply all necessary labor, material, tools and equipment for the proper construction and installation of the below equipment in accordance with this document and related drawings. The winning contractor will have to honor the manufacture warranty and provide the required warranty services on a timely manner. The company should preferably be a local company so it can provide the warranty service if needed on a timely manner 2. Job Description Purchase and installation of the below items.1 One CS 600 ChemoSHIELD Containment Glovebox for Pharmacy Compounding ApplicationsDesigned for Aseptic Compounding of Hazardous or Potent Pharmaceutical Compounds, ChemotherapyAgents and IV Admixtures that can be harmful to Pharmacy Personnel features Construction: Stainless steel interior polished to a non-glare, easy to clean #4 finish. Exterior is baked enamel for superior resistance to laboratory chemicals. Interior Dimensions: The main working chamber has dimensions of 46" (L) x 24" (w) x 25" (h). The pass thru chamber has dimensions of 17-1/2" (L) x 24" (w) x 25"(h). Exterior Dimensions: Exterior dimensions are 75" (L) x 36" (w) x 90" (h). Main Chamber: The main working chamber is equippedwith 3 stet gloves to allow users to reach all interior areas with a gloved hand. Pass-Thru Chamber: The pass-thru chamber allows users to bring items into and out of containment safely. The pass-thru chamber is equipped with one ambidextrous glove to allow users to perform a surface decontamination on items being taken into or out of containment. HEPA Filters: Both chambers are equipped with HEPA filters on the supply and exhaust. Exhaust filters are safely removed via bag-out device insuring that dangerous compounds that may be present on the exhaust HEPA filter are safely contained. Negative Pressure: Each chamber perates at a negative differential pressure relative to the room. The standard configuration has the pass-thru chamber at a more negative pressure than the main chamber. Optional configuration has the main chamber more negative than pass-thru chamber. Please specify on ordering. Inter-chamber Door: A door separates the main working chamber from the pass-thru chamber. This door should only be opened when the external pass-thru door is closed Interlocks: The Inter-chamber door and the Pass-Thru door are interlocked so that they cannot be opened at the same time. This prevents accidental exposure to internal hazards. Pass-Thru Door: The pass-thru chamber is equipped with an external door to facilitate moving items into and out ofContainment. This door should only be opened when the inter-chamber door is closed. Uni-Directional Air Flow: The internal airflow is unidirectional (laminar) from top to bottom. This provides a "piston effect" that sweeps any generated particles directly to the exhaust HEPA filters. Exhaust Hook-up: Baker's   chemoSHIELD is designed to hook up to your exhaust system. Because of the complex chemistries of today's drugs, some hazardous compounds may vaporize after being captured on the HEPA filter. HEPAfilters are not effective on vapors. Therefore, for your safety, Baker has designed the ChemoSHIELD to be connected to your exhaust ductwork system and vented to the outdoors. Exhaust Requirements: Connection to Baker's ChemoSHIELD is by 8" flange. The unit requires the exhaust system to have capacity of 375 cfm and have a negative static pressure of -2.0" water column at the exhaust connection. Lighting: The: Baker's ChemoSHIELD has interior cleanliness levels of better than Class 100 (100 measurable particles per cubic foot of air) [ISO Class 5]. The ChemoSHIELD will maintain your sterile interior environment after your standard decontamination method.The ChemoSHIELD is equipped with an IV bar to facilitate hanging. Isolators meet USP Regulations 797 2.One Hydraulic lift base for CS6003. Two Blowers. Sales and installation for in-line blower in polypropylenes with an explosion proof motor.

An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public.

(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Act- (1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or (2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision- (1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and (2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation. (d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.

<DESC>The VA Eastern Colorado Healthcare System (ECHCS) located in Denver, CO intends to negotiate sole source with St. Jude Medical S.C., Inc., to provide an EnSite three-dimensional electroanatomic arrhythmia mapping system.  EnSite is the ideal mapping system for a monoplane fluoroscopy laboratory, such as the electrophysiology lab currently being established at the ECHCS.  The unique characteristics of the EnSite are as follows:  (1)  Any electrophysiology diagnostic or ablation catheter can be visualized with EnSite, and multiple catheters can be visualized simultaneously; (2) The catheter localization technology with EnSite is based on very low-energy radio frequency energy localization from electrode patches on the chest; (3) There is no restriction to one particular vendor's catheters, which makes this system extraordinarily versatile, unlike any other mapping system; (4) Since all catheters can be visualized with EnSite, three-dimensional navigation can be achieved very easily and safely, minimizing the need for biplane real-time fluoroscopy imaging, thereby increasing efficiency and decreasing radiation exposure to patients and staff; (5) EnSite also has the option to use a non-contact mapping approach using a proprietary "array" catheter (available only with EnSite), which enables mapping localization of a single PAC or PVC, thereby making it possible to treat even difficult-to-induce arrhythmias when only single beats of the arrhythmia are seen; and (6) the algorithms for creating chamber geometry are excellent both by sweeping all catheters in the chamber in question, and the traditional point-by-point mapping is also possible, not offered by other mapping systems.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten (10) calendar days from publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The VA Eastern Colorado Healthcare System (ECHCS) located in Denver, CO intends to negotiate sole source with GE Healthcare to provide a GE Cardiolab Electrophysiology Monitoring/Recording System.  A computerized electrophysiology monitoring system for the recording, processing, and review of intracardiac electrograms is of critical importance for performing electrophysiology studies and arrhythmia ablation.  ECHCS is in the process of establishing a new Cardiac Electrophysiology Program and as such will be employing a new Medical Doctor whom has significant familiarity with the GE Cardiolab Electrophysiology Monitoring/Recording System.  The GE Cardiolab is a well-established system that is intuitive, user-friendly, powerful, and has a very clean electrogram signal display.  The GE Cardiolab system has demonstrated stability/reliability, functionality, and the electrogram filtering and display quality are peerless.  Due to the specialized nature of electrophysiology studies and arrhythmia ablation the familiarity of this technology is of paramount importance and it is our intent to minimize the potential of technical problems ultimately keeping our patients health and well being a top priority.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis. This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid. The intent of this request for information is to conduct a market investigation to collect supporting data and documentation on which to base an appropriate acquisition strategy. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.
<p>The 685th Armament Support Squadron intends to openly compete the Weapons Planning Software (WPS) contract. This contract will develop components for Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) applications supporting precision guided munitions (PGM) mission planning requirements. The scope of this contract is expected to include continued development and sustainment of the following JMPS software components:</p>
<p>a. PGMPS: This JMPS Common Component (CC) provides mission planning support for Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Joint Stand Off Weapon (JSOW), Wind Corrected Munition (WCMD), Small Diameter Bomb I/II (SDB I/SDB II), AGM-130, and the United Kingdom Paveway 4 (PW4) munitions. Other weapons may be added as directed and funded by authorized organizations. For example, under the WPS contract, the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) may be integrated into PGMPS.</p>
<p>b. JMPS Target Manager (JTM): JTM is a JMPS CC that manages target data to assist mission planners execute air strikes against the targets. This component integrates directly with PGMPS and provides interfaces such that other JMPS components may interface with JTM if desired. JTM evolved from the PGM Target Data Base (PGMTDB). Besides JTM, PGMTDB will be sustained in the UNIX environment on the USAF's Unix-Mission Planning System (MPS). PGMTDB will not be upgraded to the capabilities of JTM except for mandatory interface changes required to receive target data.</p>
<p>c. Universal Armament Interface Common Component (UAI CC): UAI CC integrates with PGMPS and aircraft Unique Planning Components (UPC) to facilitate passing of weapon target data sets to the weapon using the Mission Data Exchange Format (MiDEF) specified in MIL-STD-3014.</p>
<p>d. Key Handler Common Component (KHCC): The KHCC is now under initial development and will facilitate the passage of key data to allow mission planning of Network Enabled Weapons (NEW).</p>
<p>e. Weapon Data Link Initialization Common Component (WDLI CC): This CC provides the planner with network initialization data needed to allow NEW to operate in combat networks and is also under initial development.</p>
<p>All of the above mission planning components integrate with one or more of the other components. Additionally, all WPS contract components will integrate with fighter and bomber aircraft Mission Planning Environments (MPE) to provide a complete mission planning package for the various aircraft operational communities. WPS contract products will be used by F-15E, F-16, A-10, F-22, F-35, and B-1 operational units worldwide, including foreign nations flying those aircraft. During the expected WPS period of performance, WPS products are expected to be extended to B-2, B-52, and F-18 units as a minimum. Extensive integration efforts are required to support these aircraft MPEs.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should provide documentation for Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level III. Respondents should document their experience in military mission planning software development in general and in JMPS software development in particular. This contract will develop new JMPS components and sustain existing JMPS products. The developer must be fully competent in JMPS development and provide a seamless transition at contract award with minimal schedule impact.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should document their mission planning software development experience and capabilities dealing with the following mission planning areas of special interest to the Government: precision guided munitions, data link, data base tools, universal armament interface, crypto keys and key management.</p>
<p>The Government is anticipating a 10-year long term pricing agreement. If the RFI respondent does not accept these terms, please stipulate the length desired for contractual execution. Also provide your CAGE and DUNS codes.</p>
<p>The following sub-paragraphs are not to be addressed in your replies to this RFI. The Government intends to include evaluation factors similar in nature in the source selection. You should consider this information as you determine your ability and/or interest in submitting a proposal should the Government issue a Request for Proposal.</p>
<p>a. One of the first tasks assigned under the WPS contract is expected to be the integration of Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) mission planning requirements into PGMPS. The contractor's technical description of how to accomplish this task will be a critical Mission Capability evaluation factor. There is an existing MALD planning JMPS component but it is not integrated into PGMPS. A task for source selection evaluation will be to describe how you will meet all MALD mission planning requirements while fully integrating the MALD mission planning functionality into the PGMPS architecture and user interface design.</p>
<p>b. WPS contract products provide supporting mission planning capabilities for aircraft MPEs. It is imperative that WPS contract product development schedules be met. Otherwise, aircraft MPE schedules are adversely affected causing substantial financial impacts on those programs. Impacting dependent program schedules during the transition from the current contractor is the highest near term risk for the WPS contract. Bidders will be expected to address how they can transition from the current contractor and mitigate this program risk.</p>
<p>Clearly mark any proprietary information included in your submission.</p>
<p>Limit your RFI responses to five pages, each page shall be single spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch (10 point).</p>
<p>For questions, please contact: 685 ARSS, Attn. Jason Barnes, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 626, Eglin AFB, FL 32542; jason.barnes@eglin.af.mil; 850-882-0058. Responses to this Request for Information should be sent to Grisselle Nusimow, Contracting Officer, at Grisselle.Nusimow@eglin.af.mil. Please respond no later than 6 March 2009.</p>

<DESC>Purpose

This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) only for the purposes of conducting market research and does not obligate the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) in any way. This is not a request for proposal and BPA will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information. Responses are due no later than June 5, 2009.

Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. Material submitted will be deemed proprietary to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations if so marked by the respondent.

BPA's acquisition practices are not governed by the same rules and regulations of other federal agencies. BPA acquisitions are subject to the policies and procedures outlined in the Bonneville Purchasing Instructions (BPI) which is available for viewing at: http://www.bpa.gov/corporate/business/bpi/.

Project Background

BPA managers have authority to inquire into and to take administrative actions regarding the conduct of the employees in their workplace.  BPA provides managers advice and assistance in that role through its Employee Relations and Office of General Counsel organizations.  When managers wish to obtain competent investigative services for the gathering of information rather than to undertake the investigative process themselves, they can authorize Employee Relations or the Office of General Counsel to conduct an investigation.   

Objectives/Goals

The goal of investigative services contracts is to provide assistance to BPA managers who in order to carry out the duties of their positions need to obtain timely and reliable information regarding a wide range of workplace issues, including but not limited to violations of law, BPA policy or other conduct standards applicable to BPA employees.   

Deliverables required by the contract may include 
(1) witness statements, documented in the manner required by the instructions, 
(2) documents obtained during the investigation with adequate reference (e.g., tabbing, exhibit designation, etc.), and 
(3) written or oral investigative report. 

Requested Information

The vendor must be located in Washington or Oregon.

Interested vendors may submit their capabilities and qualifications and any other pertinent information should they choose. Please see the Statement of Work attached for more information on BPA's requirements. At a minimum, please include the following information for your firm: 
a. Company name 
b. Address and website 
c. Phone and Fax number
d. E-mail address 
e. Point of contact information.

Responses can be submitted via email to rakulak@bpa.gov.

This is not a Request for Proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to provide a capability statement along with answers to specific market survey questions in order to demonstrate related experience and ability to perform the work described herein.  All interested parties, including large businesses and all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are encouraged to respond.

Background

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created as an independent agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected.  It regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials (such as in nuclear medicine) through licensing, inspection and enforcement of its requirements.  The NRC’s headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and it has multiple offices within the Continental United States (CONUS).  The agency’s current IT infrastructure services vehicle (NRC-DR-01-290; NRC ADAMS Accession #: ML012850130) expires on September 27, 2010.

The NRC intends to acquire services and support for its IT environment from a contractor.  The NRC requires this contractor to integrate the current NRC IT environment into a centrally managed enterprise system capable of providing support 24 hr/day, 7 day/week, and 365 days/year, along with the ability to address future enhancement, modernization, and technology change.  The contract envisioned by the NRC will include primarily the following Information Technology Infrastructure Library version 3 (ITIL v3) service areas (in partnership with the NRC):

 
1 	Service Strategy 
1.4 	Demand Management 

2 	Service Design 
2.1 	Service Catalog Management

<p>Atom Probe Tomography Instrumentation</p>
<p>EMSL, a US DOE national scientific user facility, located at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, is planning to procure an atom probe tomography (APT) system. As opposed to the conventional field ion microscope(s) and the first generation 1D atom probe systems, we seek a state-of-the-art, 3-dimensional atom probe tomography tool to align well with EMSL vision to achieve sub-nanometer "chemical imaging" and to compliment the high resolution transmission electron microscope(s) and other surface and interfacial analysis tools available in the laboratory. Large field of view and rapid, accurate and repeatable, data acquisition are very essential for the success of such an instrument along with the availability of both voltage and laser pulsing capabilities. High mass resolution is a must for the system of interest in order to serve the needs of the EMSL user community and the DOE with interests in a gamut of materials, including metals, minerals, oxide multi-layers. Compatibility with focused ion beam based sample preparation is highly desired. Data analysis being the most important and critical aspect of the 3D-atom probe tomography, the potential instrument should also include high precision software to facilitate precise identification of interfaces, grain boundaries and inclusions. With this tool, we desire to provide, otherwise impossible insights into various surface and interfacial phenomena and there by understand, design and manipulate the material systems of interest to critical DOE mission(s) to develop greener and sustainable energy technologies and achieve environmental protection. Some of the specifications desired in the potential instrument are provided below:</p>
<p>&bull; Data acquisition rates up to 2 M ions/min<br />&bull; &lt; 3 ns pulse pair resolution <br />&bull; Imaging resolution down to 0.2 nm lateral and 0.1 nm depth <br />&bull; &gt;150 nm field-of-view (up to 200 nm) and high analyzed volumes (106 nm3) <br />&bull; High sensitivity to minor inclusions and dopants (down to ppm levels)</p>
<p>In addition, we require ease of operation and windows operated user interface and controls.</p>
<p>EMSL being a user facility, the instrument supplier should offer user friendly training, high durability and excellent technical, engineering support to minimize the down time.</p>

<DESC>This notice is issued by The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, located in Menlo Park, California. We are soliciting responses from interested parties to provide all personnel, materials, equipment, facilities and services required to complete engineering, design, documentation, fabrication, assembly, installation and acceptance testing of the X-ray Correlation Spectroscopy (XCS) Instrument Diffractometer System. The LCLS-LUSI XCS diffractometer system will be used to precisely control the physical location and orientation of a sample but also align the sample in the x-ray beam. The nature of the LCLS-LUSI XCS Instrument requires an extraordinary level of flexibility and accuracy from the diffractometer system. The diffractometer consists of two major components, the sample goniometer (purpose of this document) and a local detector (provided by SLAC, but its motion is included in this scope of this document) to aid the alignment of the sample in the x-ray beam. The sample goniometer must have the ability to position the sample within two widely separated interaction point regions. The system must incorporate features to enable the use of future sample vacuum environments such as a cryostat or cryo-stream. The diffractometer system design must enable rapid reconfiguration to maximize science output.  Vendors interested in performing this requirement are invited to provide the following information to SLAC Purchasing Office no later than 20 May 2009. The information may be submitted via email to the Contract Administrator at johne@slac.stanford.edu or faxed to 650-926-8785.

<p class="MsoNormal">As part of its market research,
the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) of Bethesda,
MD is seeking sources interested and capable of providing a Learning Management
System. This RFI aims to communicate with industry our interest in a Learning
Management System, receive feedback from industry that identifies multiple
sources, find interested vendors to foster competition, and use the information
gained from this notice to prepare any future solicitation in a way which
benefits both the Government and the contractor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This announcement is an
official Request for Information (RFI), as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is
not a request for proposal, but a survey to locate potential sources to meet
our requirement. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with
providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up
information requests.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Project
Information:<span>&nbsp; </span>The Uniformed Services University
of the Health Sciences includes the F. Edward H&eacute;bert School of Medicine, which provides
a year-round, four-year curriculum similar to other U.S. medical schools and
has Doctoral and master&rsquo;s degrees in the biomedical sciences and public health
awarded by interdisciplinary and department-based graduate programs. USU also
has a Graduate School of Nursing which offers a Master of Science in Nursing
degree in Nurse Anesthesia, Family Nurse Practitioner, Preoperative Nursing, Doctorate
of Nursing Practice, and a Ph.D. degree in Nursing Science. The University has
a growing portfolio of credit and continuing education courses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We are interested in
acquiring a commercial off the shelf (COTS) or Open Source software, services
and hosting designed specifically for use as a learning management system.<span>&nbsp; </span>The system will provide individual course and
student lab support, host content, continuing education courses and tracking,
e-portfolio, provide integration with Web 2.0 and mobile applications, perform
online tests and quizzes, and integrate with a university registrar system
enabling simple course setup and exchange of grade data. USU may also use the
system as the USU Intranet and for a virtual research environment platform</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">USU is currently using
Blackboard 7.x.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the event the USU
determines that an alternative system meets our needs we will be extremely
interested in knowing how existing courses/tests/quizzes would be migrated to
another vendor&rsquo;s platform.<span>&nbsp; </span>The software
must allow USU to exchange data with the University&rsquo;s Corporate Database (Oracle)
and the University&rsquo;s Intranet and Registrar system.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition to supporting our traditional
on-site instructional programs, the system will also need to support multiple
USUHS programs such as the National Center for Disaster Medicine and
Preventative Health, the Virtual Medical University, online Master&rsquo;s of Public
Health, and the growing USUHS continuing education and distributed learning
portfolio.<span>&nbsp; </span>Attached is the &ldquo;Functional

<DESC>THIS IS A REPOSTING OF SOLICITATION # HSCG23-09-R-2DB043 on April 30, 2009

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) awarded a competitive Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in 2002 to Integrated Coast Guard System (ICGS), a joint venture between then Northrop Grumman Ship Systems (now Northrop Grumman Ship Building (NGSB) and Lockheed Martin Corporation, to serve as the Deepwater Systems Integrator for recapitalization of USCG assets.  Three (3) National Security Cutters (NSCs) and the Long Lead Time Material (LLTM) for the fourth (4th) ship were procured under the subject IDIQ contract.  

The USCG intends to award a sole source, Fixed Price Incentive Fee contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 to NGSB for the fourth (4th) NSC (with optional support CLINs, such as shipboard spares and outfitting); the option for the Long Lead Time Material (LLTM) and Production and Delivery of the fifth (5th) NSC (with optional support CLINs, such as shipboard spares and outfitting); and the option for the LLTM for the sixth (6th) ship.  The follow on ships are to be of the same dimensions, configuration and operational capability as the first three (3) NSCs.  The NSC(s) are to be delivered within 38 months at the point of origin.  The proposed contract is to be for a period of five (5) years and to be awarded on or about March 2010.  The intended sole source award to NGSB, 1000 Access Road, Pascagoula, MS 39567, NAISC Code:  336611 - Naval Shipbuilding; Classification Code 3731, Naval Shipbuilding, is under authority of FAR 6.302-1(2)(iii)(A) and (B), based on the substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, as well as an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  Award to any other source would result in a negative operational impact to the USCG.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency  The solicitation will not be released through GPE.  Should any interested party request a copy of the solicitation,  please contact the Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist.

<CONTACT>JANET L. GARTEN (703) 432-4071DAMON TREVITHICK (703) 432-4246
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to negotiate and award a sole-source contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation, Maritime Systems & Sensors, Electronics Parkway, Syracuse, NY, 13221-4840 for non-personal services for life cycle management support for the AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System.  The AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System is a lightweight, transportable, long-range, solid state, 3D L-Band radar.  The radar can be integrated as a surveillance radar with the AN/TYQ-23(V)4 as the principal sensor of the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC).  The radar may also be configured for operation with the Air Defense Communications Platform (ADCP) to provide Theater Ballistic Missile (TBM) data cues to Air Defense weapons systems via a Point-to-Point Data Link (PPDL).  It is the only tactical system capable of detecting, tracking, and providing cueing information on short, medium, and long range TBMs.  This system is proven to be invaluable in its contribution to TMD in both ! the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and joint theater battlefield.  Current support for the TPS-59(V)3 is contracted with Lockheed Martin.  MCSC anticipates the award of a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ)Task Order contract for a base and four option years.  Support will include the following:  1) engineering studies to support system improvements, eliminate obsolescence, and capitalize on technology insertion; 2) development of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) in concert with the previous studies for implementation in the system baseline; 3) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) in the form of a Vendor Level Maintenance Program (VLM); 4) CLS in the form of Field Service Representatives (FSRs) for the TPS-59(V)3 at the fielded sites; 5) procurement and incorporation of ECPs in the TPS-59(V)3 baseline; 6) CLS in the form of provisioning data products subsequent to ECP procurement, including parts list, identification data, engineering drawings, cha! nge pages to drawings, change pages to Technical Manuals (TMs) and updates to Interactive Electronic TMs (IETMs); and 7) a Program Management (PM) structure to encompass single interface for the management of all program elements.  Lockheed Martin is considered the only source capable of meeting these requirements.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement.  No telephonic requests will be accepted.  All communications shall be in writing to the Contracting Officer and will only be used to consider whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC><p>Special Notice SN-09-34 VS 33: Survivability of Interdependent Systems Proposer's Workshop, DATE: June 4, 2009; REGISTRATION DEADLINE: May 21, 2009, TECHNICAL POC: Nozer Singpurwalla, DARPA/DSO, Email: nozer.singpurwalla@darpa.mil , URL: www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm
<p>DARPA is hosting a Proposer's Workshop that will provide information regarding the program vision, milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team to respond to a potential DARPA program entitled "Survivability of Interdependent Systems."</p>
<p>Currently, the metric for assessing system survivability uses a fixed and known reliability. As reliability is a physical propensity, it cannot be known. Also, propensity needs to be time indexed. Therefore, the existing method is limited. This potential program would seek to develop and validate a new procedure for the realistic evaluation of the survivability of complex interdependent systems and networks. The development of this procedure would involve developing stochastic processes with novel properties and a stochastic calculus for the processes that will enable new capabilities for system risk assessment. This procedure would then have to be validated either analytically or by simulation, and software for implementation would have to be created and validated. The new procedure will have to be tried out on realistic systems, war gaming, logistics, etc., and the role of industry here will be centered. Further program details and milestones will be available in a potential Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p>The Survivability of Interdependent Systems Proposer's Workshop will be held at the Liberty Conference Center, 4075 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 350, Arlington, VA 22203, 8:00am - 4:00pm ET, June 4, 2008, and will consist of information, discussion, and networking sessions between academics, industry, and Government Laboratories. In the information session, overview presentations will be given by Government personnel to: (a) introduce the research community to the Interdependent Systems program vision and goals; (b) explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort; and (c) encourage and promote teaming. This will be followed by an open discussion session to provide the opportunity for participants to interact with Government personnel and have their questions answered. A networking session following the discussion will facilitate interaction and team building among the Workshop participants. The latter part of the Workshop has been reserved for brief (15 minute) individual sidebar discussions with the Program Manager and his scientific advisors. Sidebars are crisp, high-information content presentations of specific program ideas and approaches. Detailed follow-up discussions will be held as needed. Further details are available on the registration website listed below.</p>
<p>Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise, facilities, and capabilities to address all of the Survivability of Interdependent Systems program's technical challenges will be crucial to its success. The multidisciplinary nature of this program will require diverse sets of skills and expertise to develop total solutions to the program objectives and achieve all of the program goals and milestones. An important element of the Survivability of Interdependent Systems Proposer's Workshop is to facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to a potential Broad Agency Announcement.

<CONTACT>Morrell C. Jordan, Phone 202.205.7832, Email morrell.jordan@wdc.usda.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

The United States Government currently occupies approximately 4,690 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease in Spooner, Wisconsin, that will expire May 31, 2009.  The lease term requirement is five years.  The space must be available for occupancy by June 1, 2009.  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
North-Poplar Street			East-Roundhouse Road 
South-Maple Street/Hwy. 70		West-Summit Street.

Other applicable requirements include:
	
-	Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)

-	Parking – 46 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessor’s control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)
3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.

This contract is intended to fund several aspects of a continuing collaborative study regarding nonsyndromic hereditary hearing impairment being carried out among families in Pakistan.  Continued clinical evaluation of the families needs to be performed.  Continued enrollment of new families needs to occur.  Another aspect of this contract is to benefit from the presence of a long established and highly respected research center in a region of the world where many families practice consanguinity.  Personnel from the Center of Excellence will be allowed to come to the NIH for training as part of the collaboration established with Pakistan according to the guidelines sanctioned by our IRB, OPRR and the Division of International Relations, NIH Fogarty Center. DNA samples from all families that are enrolled in this study will be sent to the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics for analysis along with a copy of the signed Informed Consent and clinical data for each participant.  These samples have proven invaluable for the identification of mutations in the genes causing hereditary hearing impairment.

 Again, this is a  notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis withNational Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology for the continuation of services and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price purchase order for the services requested utilizing simplified acquisition procedures.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Dr. Miles Greiner, of the University of Nevada-Reno, to perform an independent technical peer review of analyses completed by the NRC of severe transportation accidents involving long duration fires.  The period of performance will be from the date of award to August 31, 2010.  The NRC staff has reviewed historical transportation accidents involving long duration fires to ensure that transportation packages for radioactive materials would survive real-life accidents and that the regulations for fire resistance of packages in 10 CFR Part 71 are adequate.  The Division of Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation (SFST) has published several NUREG/CR reports on the reviews done of the Baltimore tunnel fire (that occurred in July, 2001) and the Caldecott Tunnel fire (that occurred in April, 1982).  Two severe transportation accidents are currently under review: The April 27, 2007, gasoline tanker truck accident on the Interstate 880/580 junction (the "MacArthur Maze") in Oakland, California and the October 12, 2007, series of collisions in an Interstate 5 truck by-pass tunnel (the "Newhall Pass") in Santa Clarita, California.  The results from these studies are expected to be available by the end of calendar year 2009.

Based on the staff’s involvement with the radioactive material packaging and transportation community for over 30 years, no other member this community could be identified that has the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience in the area of thermal analysis of radioactive material transportation packages and spent nuclear fuel, the testing and modeling of severe fires, and the performance of transportation packages in severe, long duration fires than Dr. Greiner.  More importantly, none could be identified that has met the criteria for independence that Dr. Greiner has.  

The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690.  This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC’s needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address not later than 15 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;The US Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT), Norfolk, VA intends to negotiate a modification to the existing purchase order, HSCG84-09-N-AA8295, for rental of mobile kitchen and dining room at USCG SFO Galveston TX, to add a CLIN for a seven month rental period with two one-month option CLINs, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2). The modification would extend the current purchase order seven months from 1 June 2009 through 31 December 2009; with options, if exercised, through 28 February 2010. The modification for continued rental of mobile kitchen and dining room will be negotiated with incumbent contractor, Stewart's Mobile Concepts Ltd., 845 E. Jericho Turnpike, Huntington Station NY 11746-7504.</p>
<p>The extension includes the rental of mobile kitchen and dining room to include 8'x45' mobile kitchen with propane equipment; flat griddle; deep fat fryer; 6 burner stove-top; double convection oven; 20 gallon kettle; work tables for food preparation; 2-compartment sink for produce washing; hand sink for hand-washing; 8'x10' walk in reefer; two stand-up freezers; punch dispenser; steam table for serving hot items; and a 7'x10' enclosed dry-store room. Dining facility includes restroom and seating for 40-50 people. A dishwashing room with a heavy duty commercial 1-compartment dishwasher is also part of rental equipment.</p>
<p>An extension to current purchase order would avoid a duplication of significant delivery, setup, and pickup costs; and an interrupted galley service that is responsible for feeding 110-120 SFO Galveston personnel and tenant commands. The extension is needed due to unanticipated delay in the renovation/repair of existing galley building that was left damaged during Hurricane IKE. Flood damages to the electrical equipment &amp; mildew throughout the building still exist causing the building to be unusable for normal operations.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the US Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Submit all questions or responses to this notice to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Reginald Henderson via e-mail at reginald.b.henderson@uscg.mil, by 22 May 2009, 4:00PM (EST).</p>

SOW for emergence box modifications 


Back ground: The pink Bollworm Rearing Facility (PBWRF) located in Phoenix, AZ supplies 26 million sterile moths per day to participating states and Mexico as part of the Pink Bollworm Eradication Program of this series cotton pest. One operation in the facility employs metal boxes called emergence boxes which are used for pupae eclosion boxes. Many of these boxes are in excess of 15 years old and have become impossible to completely seal around the rear door. This lack of complete sealing allows PBW  moths to escape. We therefore need to modify the boxes and lids to prevent such escapes.
Purposes and Objectives: The PBWRF requires a vendor to implement the following redesign of the rear door and modification of 500 boxes. Specifications are as follows.
Box modifications:
•	Removal of rolled hem edge on end of box.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Guymon, OK, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4,410 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,775 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for 5 years.  The space must be available for occupancy by August 1, 2009.   The delineated area is within an area bounded on the North by 245h Street; on the East by Hurliman Road: on the South, not further south than South 6th Street, on the West by Sunset Lane:  accessible by hard surface maintained primary roads.

Other applicable requirements include:

Parking:  a minimum of 40 parking spaces.  Lot must be arranged in a manner to accommodate trucks with livestock trailers and other agriculture related implements.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. Anyone interested should call Nita Morris at (405) 742-1043.  Final date to inquire about the advertisement is May 29, 2009.

This is a Total Small Business Set-Aside requirement under NAICS 721110, with a Size Standard of $7.0 Million. All qualified small businesses are encouraged to submit quotes.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms and conference center facilities for the requirements described in the attached SOW for participants attending the FY 2009 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) peer review in the Baltimore, MD area. DHS/FEMA has tentatively scheduled the multiple conferences for the following period: July 06-17, 2009 (2 weeks and up to 200 people, weekend in between is not included). The Baltimore area for the purposes of this solicitation includes hotels with conference centers located within an up to approximately 30-35 minute travel distance from the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be capable of offering facilities accommodating up to approximately 200 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details and pricing sheet). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only. Participants will call the hotel/motel at least 7 days prior to the conference date to reserve their room. Callers will identify themselves as participants (attendees) in the "FY 2009 AFG Peer Review," and give the hotel/motel the dates for which they will require lodging. Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to reserve their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. The resultant contract is intended to cover the price of hotel rooms occupied for the conference attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The "Conference Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which each conference will be held. The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms shall be structured in a format that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order. Offerors shall also provide a copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. Upon conclusion of the conference and final determination of final costs such as costs expected to be but not covered by the attendees, conference facilities/space, and costs associated with audio-visual requirements if not included with package quote, will be covered under the commercial purchase order to be issued by the Government in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per-night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms and conference spaces to be paid for by the Federal Government. Quotes shall be inclusive of the per-night cost per room, a sub-total cost indicating the cost for each of the night periods separately, and a Conference Total for the entire period. In order to be considered for award, the offer must be determined to be technically acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The evaluation factors for this procurement are Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror's quotation will be subjected to the following "Go/No Go" criteria:<br /><br />(1) The offeror must demonstrate ability to provide the requested number of guest rooms/nights and associated conference facilities as described in the SOW on the dates indicated, (2) The offeror must be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act, (3) The offeror must be registered in CCR prior to award, and (4) The offeror shall not be on the debarred or excluded parties list.</span></p>

<DESC>Angora Creek Watershed
Stream Corridor Analysis and Meadow-Channel Restoration Design Project 

The USDA Forest Service, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU), South Lake Tahoe, California, is seeking a qualified consultant to provide professional services for a stream corridor analysis to verify Forest Service initial assumptions, fine-tune our understanding of the project site and its relationship to the watershed upstream, and then work together to develop 100% design plans and specifications to implement this work. The project is located in El Dorado County and is accessible from Lake Tahoe Blvd west of the City of South Lake Tahoe.

The Watershed

Angora creek is a two square mile, bowl shaped watershed that drains off the Tahoe-Sierra Crest. Elevation in the contributing watershed ranges from 6360, to over 8500, feet. The underlying bedrock is granites of Sierra Nevada Batholith. Two lakes exist at the head of the watershed, with numerous tributaries and springs feeding the main stem of Angora Creek. The longitudinal profile of the watershed is stair-stepped, a pattern typical of headwater basins in the Sierra Nevada. Meadows have formed along low gradient treads. Watershed vegetation is typical of that found in upper montane and sub alpine watersheds in the central Sierra Nevada. 

Project Location 

The project begins approximately 100 feet above the Lake Tahoe Blvd crossing. The project continues for approximately 3000 feet upstream to break in valley slope where the stream type transitions for a meadow to upland style.

Scope of Work
Professional and technical services shall include all labor, materials, equipment, and facilities, as required to conduct a meadow-stream corridor analysis to be the basis for the development of engineering plans and specifications suitable for use by the Forest Service to conduct implementation in-house.

<p>The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519, and the small business size standard is $23.0 million.&nbsp; This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.&nbsp; This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.&nbsp; It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to procure the products/services specified below from <strong>OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc., 9 Bisbee Ct., Suite D, Santa Fe, NM 87508.</strong></p>
<p>1. Software Non-Profit Annual Lease Package for Cheminformatics.<br />2. One year lease term, to include options to renew for two (2) twelve month periods.<br />3. Products included: FILTER, BROOD, OMEGA, ROCS, EON, SZYBKI, FRED, QUACPAC, VIDA, VIVANT, LEXICHEM TOOLKIT, SZYBKI TOOLKIT, OGHAM TOOLKIT, ZAP TOOLKIT, &amp; OEChem TOOLKIT.<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chemical Genomics Center is a component of the NIH Roadmap's Molecular Libraries Program.&nbsp; The center discovers and develops small molecule probes to study the function of gene products.</p>
<p>OpenEye products provide two types of uses at The NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC):</p>
<p>1. Scientific applications: management and analysis of small molecules, modeling of proteins and small molecule interactions.<br />2. Software Development Toolkits for modeling and cheminformatics: the Informatics group at the NCGC has undertaken an in-house software development effort to build an open source software system that handles the innovative operations of our center.&nbsp; OpenEye's scientific toolkits are needed in the NCGC's software development efforts.<br />The site licensing of these products also allows the informatics group to deploy these scientific applications throughout the organization.</p>
<p>Among the modeling applications are:<br />AFITT - crystallographic refinement and analysis <br />BROOD - bioisostere identification using shape, chemistry and electrostatic similarity <br />EON - chemical similarity analysis via comparison of electrostatics overlay <br />FILTER - molecular screening and selection based on physical property or functional group <br />FRED - extremely fast, systematic docking search for ligand binding within a protein active site <br />OMEGA - systematic high-throughput conformer generation, including 1D or 2D to 3D structure generation <br />QUACPAC - quality charge states and charges for small molecules and proteins <br />ROCS - chemical similarity analysis via rapid 3D molecular shape searches <br />SMACK - molecular databases query converter and optimizer (SMARTS and MDL) <br />SZYBKI - fast structure optimization of ligands in gas-phase, solution, or within a<br />protein active site<br />VIDA - graphical user interface that visualizes, analyzes and manages corporate collections of molecular structures and information <br />WABE - electrostatics optimization of a lead compound.</p>
<p>Among the toolkits are:<br />Case - generalized function optimization, e.g. molecular structure optimization <br />Lexichem - state-of-the-art compound name and structure inter-conversion OEChem - cheminformatics and 3D molecular data handling <br />OEChem bundled apps - all the useful apps that are included with OEChem <br />Ogham - elegant 2D structure rendering of compounds <br />Shape - molecular shape comparisons based on 3D overlays <br />Zap - an efficient Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics solver<br />AdjustCharge - adjusts formal charges on specified atoms <br />BitVecTest - manipulates fingerprints, calculates Tanimoto <br />Babel2 - converts data between file formats (SMILES, SLN, SDF, MOL, MOL2, PDB, FASTA, MOPAC, MacroModel, XYZ, and OEBinary) <br />CanSMI - writes canonical SMILES <br />Clique - enumerates common substructures <br />Flipper - enumerates unspecified stereocenters of SMILES input <br />Frag - SMARTS based molecular fragmentation for R-group analysis <br />LibGen - generates product library from SMIRKS and reactant list <br />MCSS - determines maximum common substructure <br />MolCount - counts molecules and conformers <br />MolGrep - searches flat files for molecules containing specified substructures <br />PDB2Lig - ligand extraction from PDB files <br />RMSD - determines minimum RMS distance between two molecules, with proper recognition of automorphism <br />SimpleMolCount - reports average number of atoms, bonds and conformers <br />Sdf2csv - writes SD tag values into comma separated format suitable for spreadsheets <br />TPSA - 2D topology base polar surface area.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are no known commercially available software product packages that are comparable to those offered by OpenEye Scientific Software.&nbsp; In order to compare OpenEye's products, one must break down each individual tool.&nbsp; OpenEye products are among the best in the molecular modeling world and consist of software development toolkits that are available in various technical platforms including support for C++, Java, and Python programming languages.&nbsp; The NIH Chemical Genomics Center has been using this software package for three years, and the continued use is essential in maintaining data analysis continuity from project to project.&nbsp; This software is critical to many ongoing projects currently being processed by the informatics section, and any changes in software would cause unwanted and unknown variables.</p>

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” or the “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the “Invoice” option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                    Commandant (G-A)

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delievery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>
<p>(1) ( )In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

Period of Performance:  Performance shall be for six months from date of award.



BASIS FOR AWARD:   

Award will be made, subject to available funding and quoter responsibility, to that acceptable quote, the price or cost of which is not necessarily the lowest, but which is sufficiently more advantageous to the Government than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of additional amounts, based on the evaluation criteria described in this section

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price.  In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose response provides the best overall value to the Government.

The Evaluation Process:

The Government will award a contract resulting from this quotation to the responsible contractor whose quote conforming to the quotation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate the prospective contractors and are listed in order of importance.  

	1.  Technical Approach (80%)
	2.  Past Performance (20%)
	3.  Price 


FORMAT AND INFORMATION FOR SUBMITTING A QUOTATION:

Please submit ONE (1) original plus three (3) copies of entire quotation.  Please mark original as “ORIGINAL” and copy as “COPY.”

Please submit responses in TWO SEPARATELY BOUND VOLUMES

VOLUME 1:  CONTRACT AND PRICING DOCUMENTS

The Evaluation Criteria shall be applied in assessing quotations.  The criteria are listed in descending order of importance.


	
VOLUME 2:  TECHNICAL FACTORS: 

1.	Technical Approach: (80 Points):   

The technical response should clearly and fully demonstrate the quoter’s full understanding of the capabilities, knowledge and experience, and personnel requirements, as stated in the statement of work.  Failure to respond explicitly to each of the categories may result in the quoter’s offer/quotation being deemed technically unacceptable.



2.		Past Performance: (20 Points)   

The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.

The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. 

The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance.  The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.  The past performance subfactors are listed below in order of relative importance.  These subfactors will be used to evaluate the quality of past performance.


Past Performance Subfactors:
•	Record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship

<DESC><p><strong>AMENDMENT ONE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 1: Would a cover letter, surety letter and general contractor's license count toward the 10 page limit?</strong></p>
<p>Answer 1: Contractors are required to submit the requested information found in the Stage I factors for viability and the corporate surety letter.  If additional information is submitted in Stage I, i.e. General Contractor license, it will be counted towards the 10 one-sided  8-1/2"x 11" pages or 5 double-sided 8-1/2"x 11" pages limit for the Stage I submission.  A cover page, table of contents page and section separators will not count towards the page limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:Where can I get the Request for Proposal for this project?</strong></p>
<p>Answer 2: The Request for Proposal (RFP) is not available under the Presolicitation Notice/Stage I.  The RFP will be sent to all VIABLE Offerors following Stage I evaluation.&nbsp; Offerors that are deemed NOT VIABLE based on their submission to Stage I may still request the RFP from the Contracting Officer, and participate on Stage II.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: When will the Stage I CMcs for the Construction Phase be selected and displayed?</strong></p>
<p>Answer 3: Offerors presenting in Stage I will be notified of viability on or about May 15, 2009. Names of VIABLE Offerors will not be released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AMENDMENT TWO</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: Who is the Architect for the project?</strong></p>
<p>Answer 4: An Architect/Engineer has been selected under Solicitation Number GS-04P-05-EX-C-0053 in 2005.&nbsp; The selection will be posted on fedbizopps.gov when the contract is awarded.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded in the 4th quarter of FY09.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: Where and when is the Pre-Proposal?</strong></p>
<p>Answer 5: A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit will be held on Thursday, May 28, 2009, at 10:30 AM CST, in the Robert Smith Vance Federal Building in Courtroom 3 in the&nbsp;3rd Floor West Wing.&nbsp; The conference requires identification is required for building entrance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AMENDMENT THREE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 6:  Could you please let me know what forms, etc. need to be filled out to start the process with GSA? </strong></p>
<p>Answer 6:  Offerors are not required to submit forms for the Stage I presolicitation notice and there is no required format for the submitted information to be presented in.  Please reference the presolicitation notice for the specified requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions 7: Is there a pre-qualification packet available for subcontractors and suppliers for this project?&nbsp; How do subcontractors and suppliers get involved in the project?<br /></strong></p>
<p>Answer 7: There is no prequalification packet for subcontractors or suppliers.&nbsp; GSA will host an Industry Day/Networking Session once the CMc for this project has been selected.&nbsp; The Industry Day/Networking Session provides an opportunity for potential subcontractors and suppliers to market their services to the selected Offeror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 8:   Do all of the similar projects that we submit have to be renovations that exceed 100,000 G.S.F. and $25-million or would it be acceptable to submit a variety of projects that collectively meet all of the requirements? </strong></p>
<p>Answer 8:  You may submit any projects that you deem to be similar per the requirements that are outlined in the presolicitation notice.&nbsp; GSA will be using the similar requirements in the presolicitation notice to advise potential Offerors whether they are considered "VIABLE" OR "NOT VIABLE."</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) contract for maintenance dredging to the Shinnecock Inlet located off the south shore of Long Island (approximately 95 miles by water from Battery, New York). This project consists of furnishing all plant, labor, materials and equipment. This effort involves dredging to a depth of 20 feet, plus 2 feet allowable over depth, along with the removal of approximately 440,500 cubic yards of shoal material. The dredged material is to be placed on the shoreline approximately 6,500 to 8,400 feet west of the site by an ocean going hydraulic dredge. Performance of all work must be in strict accordance with the specifications and drawings. The selected contractor will be required to diligently commence work within 5 calendar days and complete the work no later than 90 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). The time stated for completion includes final cleanup of the premises. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about&nbsp;7&nbsp;APR 2009 with bid opening on/about&nbsp;21&nbsp;MAY 2009.</p>

The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less).

<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.2.4.   This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing maintenance and sustainment services for the Weather and Radar Processor (WARP) program.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541990, "All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services", with a size standard of $7.0M.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide          detailed information and past performance), and        Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses. 
The current Weather and Radar Processor (WARP) Maintenance and Sustainment Services (WMSS) contract will expire on September 30, 2009.  The FAA has an ongoing requirement for WARP services and is planning to award a new contract for a term of up to six (6) years, from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2015.  This contract will be a combination of Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) and Firm-Fixed-Priced (FFP) line items and is estimated in the amount of $75.0M.
The requirements will call for supplies and services to be performed in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW), the "U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration Specification, Weather and Radar Processor (WARP), FAA-E-2898g", and all applicable interface documents identified in the SOW.
Specific skills required include, but are not limited to, junior, mid-level, and senior qualified individuals in the following categories:  Program management, systems engineering, information systems security, integrated logistics support (ILS) management, quality assurance, configuration management, operational support, and material and support to test, deliver and install WARP system hardware, software modifications, and adaptation data changes.
In addition to highly-skilled professional personnel, the contractor must also provide WARP System hardware and software maintenance including:1) Maintenance personnel, 2) 24 hr /7 days a week, 365 days helpdesk support, 3) On-site contractor support at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) 4) Maintenance management for all WARP Systems 5) Supportability, Maintainability, and Reliability Engineering,6) WARP sustainment tasks, and 7) All weather data products except those for which Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) Data Acquisition System (ADAS), Weather Messaging Switching Center Replacement (WMSCR), National Weather Service Telecommunications Gateway (NWSTG), Alaska Regional Headquarters or Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR)-88D have been identified as the source in the WARP System Specification (FAA-E-2898g).
The WARP systems are located at 20 CONUS Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), two (2) systems at the WJHTC, Atlantic City, NJ, one (1) system at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) and one (1) system in Anchorage, Alaska.
Finally, the contractor must possess current (or recent) experience with WARP systems, equipment and component processes and procedures, as well as demonstrate a proven, reliable and dependable performance track record.  All prospective new contractors must transfer all incumbent service capabilities with no interruption.
Interested companies are required to provide (1) a capability summary of not more than 25 pages addressing corporate capabilities to accomplish this work, as well as to transition seamlessly, (2) completion of the attached market survey questionnaire.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00PM May 27, 2009.
The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities, conflict-free credentials, and unbiased status.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is a sources sought announcement.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation. 
The incumbent contractor does not have to submit a capability summary to be included in consideration for contract award.  However, with respect to any other potential contractor, the failure to submit the requested capability summary and other required  information will result in the exclusion of such company from consideration for contract award.
Inquiries relative to this announcement are to be submitted in writing by regular mail or by e-mail to the following:

Whistleblower Protections Under The American Recovery And Reinvestment Act of 2009 
(Mar 2009) 

(a) The Contractor shall post notice of employees rights and remedies for whistleblower protections provided under section 1553 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5). 

(b) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause including this paragraph (b) in all subcontracts. 

(End of clause) 


52.204-11  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—Reporting Requirements. 
As prescribed in 4.1502, insert the following clause: 

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009) 

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause— 

“Contract”, as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. 

“First-tier subcontract” means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. 

“Jobs created” means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as “full-time equivalent” (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 

“Jobs retained” means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as “full-time equivalent” (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 

“Total compensation” means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor’s past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): 

(1) Salary and bonus. 

(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. 

(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. 

(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. 

(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. 

(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. 

(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. 

(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. 

(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at   www.FederalReporting.gov. 

(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. 

(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government’s on-line reporting tool. 

(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. 

(4) Program or project title, if any. 

(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. 

(6) An assessment of the contractor’s progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. 

(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor’s workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide— 

(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor’s existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and 

(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. 

(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if— 

(i) In the Contractor’s preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received— 

(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and 

(B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and 

(ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. 

(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report. The contractor shall advise the subcontractor that the information will be made available to the public as required by section 1512 of the Recovery Act. The contractor shall provide detailed information on these first-tier subcontracts as follows: 

(i) Unique identifier (DUNS Number) for the subcontractor receiving the award and for the subcontractor’s parent company, if the subcontractor has a parent company. 

(ii) Name of the subcontractor.

(A) In the subcontractor’s preceding fiscal year, the subcontractor received— 

(1) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues in Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants), and cooperative agreements; and 

(2) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants), and cooperative agreements; and 

(B) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

<p>General Information<br />Document Type: Synopsis / Pre-solicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: W9126G-09-R-0069 <br />Posted Date: March 13, 2009<br />Synopsis posted for: 15 days<br />Can post solicitation on: March 30, 2009<br />Current Response Date: April 30, 2009<br /><br />Classification Code: Y --- Construction of Structures and Facilities<br />Set Aside: Unrestricted Pool of Contractors <br />NAICS Code: 236220 --- Commercial &amp; Institutional Building Construction <br /><br />Contracting Office Address<br />US Army Engineer District, Fort Worth, ATTN: CESWT-CT (Karen Nelson), 819 Taylor Street Room 2A19, Fort Worth, TX 76102 <br /><br />Description <br />All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address: Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil. This Acquisition shall be competed as UNRESTRICTED. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. An unrestricted solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $370 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as Unrestricted within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $100 million and a minimum task order limitation of $100 Thousand. The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<br /><br />There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />For all large businesses proposing under the unrestricted procurement, which requires submission of a subcontracting plan, the Government will require at least 25% of the total dollars that will be awarded to them over the life of the MATOC to be subcontracted. Then, the subcontracting goals set forth in the solicitation and resulting contract will apply to those subcontracted dollars.<br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov. Notification of amendments shall be made via FebBizOpps only. It is the contractors responsibility to check the below-listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation. No corrections and/or changes to proposals will be allowed after the proposal submittal due time and date. <br /><br />Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about the estimated date of March 30, 2009.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the Request for Information (RFI) is to extend the closing date for responses. The new closing date and time shall be 12Noon EST on 21 May 2009. Please submit the information via email to Contract Specialist, Ms. I.J Ezeonwuka, at ijeoma.ezeonwuka@uscg.mil no later than this date and time.

The following questions have been received and the responses are below:

Questions (1)  A max beam width of 8.5 feet is requested.  If this boat is a true inflatable, is this max beam width inflated or deflated for transport?

Response: Please see section 910-1.2 of the specification

Question (2) It appears that twin diesel engines are desirable with water jet propulsion.  If 8.5 feet is the max beam, that is a very tight fit and limits performance.  Will a single diesel jet configuration be acceptable, or are twin outboards an option?

Response: Please suggest a recommendation

Question (3)  Is there a target overall length for the vessels or is the max beam width the determining factor?

Response: Please suggest a recommendation per section 070-2 of the specification.

The Recovery Act funds are for ADVENT Program R&amp;D demonstrations for optimized performance and fuel efficiency at all flight conditions. The ADVENT Program was solicited and awarded using competitive procedures which resulted in the award of two contracts. The resulting contractual type is Cost Share. Uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - This modification completes funding for the ADVENT Program Phase I Government Cost Share. The Recovery Act funds are for ADVENT Program R&amp;D demonstrations for optimized performance and fuel efficiency at all flight conditions. The ADVENT Program was solicited and awarded using competitive procedures which resulted in the award of two contracts. The resulting contractual type is Cost Share. Uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<AWARDEE>Teletech Government Solutions, LLC, 9197 S. Peoria Street
, Englewood, CO 80112-5833 US
<DESC><p>Pursuant to FAR 5.705(b) the following information is transmitted:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This requirement is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 acquisition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINDINGS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has a need to provide digital television (DTV) call center services to support the mandate by Congress for full-power broadcast stations transmitting only in digital signals and no longer to transmit analog signals as of June 2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DTV call center support services will provide non-personal services that will support incoming calls and answering questions from individuals regarding the transition to digital television.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contracting vehicle used for requirement is an existing GSA multiple-award / indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (MA/IDIQ) under USA Contact Center Services. There are nine (9) vendors under this IDIQ. The use of this type of contracting vehicle allowed the FCC to receive fair and reasonable prices to meet the needs of this requirement through previously-acquired sources. Thus, this requirement is conducted as a "full and open competition" through GSA's initial competition for contract award pursuant to FAR Part 16.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The award date will be April 21, 2009 with live attended agents to begin on April 27, 2009 for the base period and three one-month option periods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DETERMINATION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the inability to definitively identify the magnitude of call volume that may arise from the DTV transition, it is literally impossible for the Government to establish a reasonable-independent cost estimate to serve as the basis of a firm-fixed-price contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, and based on market research and pre-solicitation meetings with various industry providers capable of providing this service, industry providers would be apprehensive (or non-responsive) in participating in this solicitation for fear that they would borne all financial risks of unanticipated labor costs, in the event call volume exceeded projections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, this solicitation specified a time and materials/labor-hour award as being the only means to meet the Government's requirement. By doing this, offerors were able to be creative in their proposed-business solution to ensure only those human-capital resources that will actually be of value to the American taxpayer would be employed--eliminating waste and non-productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, the use of a time and materials/labor-hour method of contracting is determined to be the best value and least costly. That is because it is impracticable to secure services of this type (with an unknown quality of man-hours required).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since no desirable firm-fixed-price contract will suitability serve, the time and material/labor hour contract was awarded based on the following stipulations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A. A limited period of performance has been established (i.e., less than 90-days).</p>
<p>B. Quality assurance and surveillance shall be conducted by the Government and Contractor management personnel to ensure inefficient or wasteful methods are not used by the contractor during the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>C. A contract ceiling of $2,811,767.00 has been established as a baselin</p>

<DESC>The I-TESS system will consist of no less than the following type components: Small Arms Transmitter (SAT), Man-worn Detection System (MDS), Command and Control (C2 - mobile & portable versions), and Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Building Instrumentation, and Simulated Battlefield Weapons. The SAT will be used on the M4 and M16 type rifles and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW). The MDS and range equipment will be used to instrument the individual Marine for direct force-on-force engagement adjudication and to include the ability to support instrumentation functions such as Position Location Information (PLI) reporting. The I-TESS system will be used in MOUT Facilities and Non-Live Fire Maneuver Ranges located at various Marine Corps bases and installations which provides the setting for the USMC Pre-deployment Training Program (PTP) and other type individual and company level training support. The Marine Corps has a need to acquire and deliver trainin! g systems that provide real-time situational awareness, exercise control capabilities, and adjudication of indirect fire engagements so as to help facilitate the training exercise objectives. There is a need to collect the training actions/interactions of the Marines during the training exercise with the ability to provide immediate access of collected data for After Action Review (AAR) purposes.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>GS-01P-03-BWC-0071 
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Public Building Service, Boston Service Center, Boston, MA intends to issue a sole source contract modification in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to extend Contract Number GS-01P-03-BWC-0071 for up to a six (6) month performance period beginning June 1, 2009. The current contract provides operation and maintenance services for the Frederick C. (FC) Murphy Federal Records Building, 380 Trapelo Road, Waltham, MA 02452. The current contract expires May 31, 2009. The Government is in the process of conducting market research and soliciting the mechanical portion, which includes landscaping and snow removal, of this contract. The process is taking longer than anticipated due to changes in requirements, and interest from NISH. Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and new award to ensure continuity of services and support the transition to a new competitive award. 

The Description of the work to be performed: The Contractor shall be responsible to provide all management, supervision, labor, subcontractors, materials, supplies and equipment, and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective completion of all services described within the current contract. The contractor shall be fully responsible for providing all customer service, cleaning, mechanical operations and maintenance, incidental repairs, minor repairs, landscaping and quality control at the FC Murphy Federal Records Center, Waltham, MA. The period of performance will be six (6) months.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.” 

This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a detrimental effect on the ability of the General Services Administration to provide building services to federal agencies in the New England region. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of facilities of this size and complexity by a firm that is familiar with the equipment and hold current security clearances. Northern Management has been performing these services since 2003 and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 6-month performance period.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements within the prescribed time frame with, it may give notification via e-mail to Kevan Kivlan, Contract Specialist, at kevan.kivlan@gsa.gov no later than May 12, 2009, 10:00 a.m., EST. The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the requirements.
