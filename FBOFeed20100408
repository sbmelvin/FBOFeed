<DESC>C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP), Heads-Up Display (HUD) Data Capture<br /><br />The C-130 AMP Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) Team has a requirement to capture and record Heads Up Display(s) (HUD) video data. The HUD itself and associated electronics are proven Rockwell-Collins Line Replaceable Units (LRU)<br />Information displayed on the C-130 AMP HUD is generated by the HUD Electronics Unit (HEU); this LRU has a separate maintenance output port which can tapped for data. This data stream consists of X-Y-Z stroke signals. These signals shall be converted to a standard industry format such as "raster video".<br />This HEU output will be fed into a Heim IRIG 106 Chapter 10 data recorder, Model D200f. The Heim and associated VCR40/80 interface card will archive the HUD video data in the Chapter 10 format onto a removable data storage cartridge. While recording, the Heim also provides the means to decom the HUD video and display it in near real-time to the operators. <br />Current AMP schedule requires this capability in late CY 2010. The vendor will provide interface and data processing support during integration; this support will be on-site at Edwards AFB, CA. <br />Prior to any flight test, the unit will be ground tested by Government personnel to ensure data fidelity and clarity at the desired data sampling rate. Ground test includes post-mission playback of the recorded files for review by the Cognizant Test Engineers. The ground test facility is located at the Boeing Long Beach facility.<br />Additional information is provided here. The Government/Boeing Test Team employs the Instrumentation Loading Integration Analysis Decommutation (ILIAD) Toolset to process and re-play data collected by the Heim D200f. The initial integration and demonstration will be required in October 2010. The proposed solution must meet DT&amp;E Class T-2 Aircraft Modification Standards. Ground test support for integration and checkout is anticipated to be two (2) weeks on-site at Edwards AFB. A minimum of two (2) each units are required; options should be proposed for a third and fourth unit for formation testing such as Station Keeping Equipment (SKE) evaluations.<br />

<DESC>The United States Air Force does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or pay for the information solicited from or provided by respondents.
<p>This Request For Information is issued with the intention of starting a dialogue with the aircraft insurance industry, identifying issues and concerns, as well as to determine companies that would be able to provide the insurance described below. Please respond to the questions below and return your responses either via mail or email to the POC listed.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The country of Morocco is purchasing twenty-four (24) new Lockheed Martin F-16 military aircraft under a State Department signed Letter of Offer &amp; Acceptance (LOA) for Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Aircraft liability is Morocco's responsibility. Therefore, Morocco has requested the U.S. Air Force procure insurance to cover the planes between the acceptances of aircraft by the United States Government from Lockheed Martin's production line, until actual delivery in Morocco. This includes a few pre-ferry flights by Lockheed Martin pilots and ferry flights to Morocco by USAF pilots. A ferry consists of a minimum of two planes flown together at one time, but may consist of more. The first twenty-two (22) aircraft will be ferried over the period of July 2011 to Dec 2012. The last ferry will occur sometime in the year 2013 for the last two aircraft. Of these last two aircraft, one jet, flown by USAF pilots, will be used for integration and characterization flight tests at Edwards Air Force Base. The other jet is a spare for the integration and characterization flight tests. These last two aircraft will be held in the US for up to a year after acceptance before final delivery to Morocco.<br />The United States Air Force is seeking information on the purchase of insurance for all these planes from time of acceptance until the planes land in Morocco. The insurance certificate signer and beneficiary will be the country of Morocco.</p>
<p>We anticipate pursuing one of the following two scenarios for coverage: <br />1. One insurance policy that will cover 22 planes for 3-5 months each, and 2 planes for up to a year and a half. The insurance coverage will commence with the acceptance of each of the 24 planes in Ft. Worth, Texas, and continue until engine turned off and all published post-flight pilot checklists are completed in Morocco. <br />Up to $50M (US Dollars) coverage per aircraft.<br />Tentatively $250,000 deductible per event.<br />All risk policy with Hull, War Risk, and Liability insurance.<br />$500M Liability Insurance for any third party suits against Morocco, with no deductible.</p>
<p>Or:<br />2. One insurance policy that will cover 22 planes for 3-5 months each, and the final 2 planes for ferry only. The insurance coverage will commence with the acceptance of each of the 22 planes in Ft. Worth, Texas, continuing until engine turned off and all published post-flight pilot checklists are completed in Morocco; and for 2 planes for ferry flight only (rolling take off from US soil to Morocco, continuing until engine turned off and all published post-flight pilot checklists are completed in Morocco).<br />Up to $50M (US Dollars) coverage per aircraft.<br />Tentatively $250,000 deductible per event.<br />All risk policy with Hull, War Risk, and Liability insurance.<br />$500M Liability Insurance for any third party suits against Morocco, with no deductible.</p>
<p>Questions to Insurance Agencies and Brokers:<br />1. Have you ever received a contract from the Federal Government or Department of Defense? If so, what kind of contract? Who was your point of contact to include phone number?<br />2. Are you willing to accept a US Government Firm Fixed Price Commercial contract for this effort?<br />3. What information will you need in a solicitation in order to provide a competitive quote?<br />4. What are standard terms and conditions that we need to be aware of?<br />5. In an attempt to obtain the maximum insurance possible at the lowest cost, should we be considering insurance for the fleet of jets or per jet? Are there other options? <br />6. Please provide an estimated price range for 24 jets from acceptance to delivery in Morocco.<br />7. Please provide an estimated price range for 22 jets from acceptance to delivery in Morocco plus 2 jets for ferry only to Morocco. <br />8. Is it acceptable for the insurance policy to be signed by the Government of Morocco? <br />9. We anticipate requesting the policy and certificate for signature with the quote. If this is not acceptable, please state why not. <br />10. Should a claim arise is it reasonable to assume it would be handled between Morocco and your company?<br />11. We expect to issue a solicitation with the award made to the lowest offer. Since we don't anticipate entering into discussions after the solicitation is issued, would you be interested in attending an Industry Day at WPAFB, OH to gain a better understanding of the requirements and to ask questions? <br />12. What certificates/licenses is an insurance company required to hold to insure aircraft? Would your company be willing to provide evidence of such?<br /><br />POC: Sandra Witter<br />Phone Number:&nbsp; 937-656-6048<br />Alternate POC: David Speed<br />Phone Number: 937-656-6079<br />Wright-Patterson Air Force Base<br />2725 C Street, Area B, Bldg. 553<br />WPAFB, OH&nbsp; 45433-7424<br /><br /><a href="mailto:sandi.witter@wpafb.af.mil">sandi.witter@wpafb.af.mil</a> or <a href="mailto:david.speed@wpafb.af.mil">david.speed@wpafb.af.mil</a> <br /></p>

Background:   The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Justice Services, Operations Division through an internal evaluation conducted by the Professional Standards Division; identified deficiencies in proper evidence storage:  Currently, our law enforcement agencies are storing items that hold a potential for high liability to our agency in standard evidence lockers.  The items need a more secure storage system for: large sums of money, drugs-including controlled substances and narcotics, valuable items such as diamonds, gold, platinum jewelry, weapons that include handguns, and long guns. The identified items pose a greater security risk of theft; therefore a higher standard of storage is necessary.

The vendor will deliver the units to specific agency locations throughout the United States. The locations will include, but not limited to:

<DESC>The Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission (Commission) is responsiblefor mitigating the impacts to fish and wildlife that resulted from construction of the Central UtahProject. As part of its mitigation program, the Commission has developed the Provo RiverRestoration Project (PRRP). This project will restore 12 miles of the middle Provo Riverbetween Jordanelle and Deer Creek Reservoirs in Wasatch County, Utah. This section of riverwas channelized in the 1950s and 1960s, and consequently lost many of its abundant naturalresources, such as riparian forests, emergent wetland, backwaters, and deep fishing holes. It isthe objective of the PRRP to realign the river to a more natural channel and regain the vegetativeand wildlife resources once supported by the river. Construction activities associated with the restoration project will create many new landscape features. During these construction activities, some natural riverine and upland areas will be disturbed. The Commission will actively re-vegetate constructed features and disturbed areas with native, local plant materials as each construction phase is completed.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is a 12 month base period and four 12 month options. <br />The purpose of this procurement is for Beckman-Coulter to provide annual preventative maintenance service as well as emergency on-site support in the event the instruments fail to work properly. The liquid handling robotic instruments require extensive programming often requiring the help of either online support or telephone support to determine the best way to achieve the desired laboratory method. <br />Beckman-Coulter is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirement because they are the original equipment manufacture of the instruments and they are the only company capable of maintaining the systems. Beckman-Coulter provides service manuals to their engineers only containing service procedures applicable to the equipment they are trained on. These engineers also receive schematics and wiring diagrams pertinent to the instruments. The Beckman-Coulter trained engineers periodically receive service information and updates often consisting of compilation of recent problems and suggested methods of correction. These service information reports are only distributed to the personnel trained and actively employed by Beckman-Coulter. <br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Beckman-Coulter. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications to provide the services to Richard Jenkins via email ONLY at RJenkins@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2010-N-12094 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 23, 2010. <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 541380, Testing Laboratories. The period of performance is a 12 month base period and two 12 month option periods. <br />The purpose of this procurement is to obtain expertise and technical assistance to support CDC's Inorganic and Radiation Analytical Toxicology Branch's Quality Assurance Programs, Lead and Multi-element Program (LAMP), and their Filter Paper (FP) Proficiency Testing Program in helping them to acquire both bovine and whole blood, prepare bovine blood materials, prepare whole blood materials on appropriate filter paper media, and distribute them to the participating laboratories for each of the respective programs. <br />The University of Wisconsin is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirement because they are the only full service proficiency testing provider that administers a nationwide Filter Paper Blood Lead Proficiency Testing and Lead and Multi-element Proficiency (LAMP) Program with distributions to more than 100 laboratories. Additionally, the University of Wisconsin has proven experience in bovine blood handling, which includes all veterinary support within the limits of animal care and use protocols, as well as experience distributing quality controls and proficiency testing samples monthly. UW also maintains a trace clean room laboratory environment used in conjunction with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer that enables the lab to screen prepared bovine whole blood pools for homogeneity and assign target values when necessary while continuing to monitor all collection and pooling material for trace metal contamination. Most importantly, the University of Wisconsin encompasses the ability to purchase and maintain bovine and whole blood needed for this project in accordance with all state and federal regulation. This distinctive ability alone is essential to the expansion needed to support both the CDC's LAMP and Filter Paper Programs, which cannot be obtained in the current capacity of the Inorganic and Radiation Analytical Toxicology Laboratory.<br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the University of Wisconsin. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications to provide the services to Richard Jenkins via email ONLY at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rjenkins@cdc.gov">rjenkins@cdc.gov</a> with the solicitation number 2010-N-12095 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 23, 2010. <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<a href="mailto:zachary.tevis@us.army.mil">USPFO for Wisconsin</a>
<DESC>This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project. POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ZACHARY R. TEVIS. SUBMIT QUESTIONS VIA E-MAIL TO: zachary.tevis@us.army.mil. The NAICS code is 541330 Engineering Services. The size standard is $4.5 Million. This action is being undertaken in accordance with the Architectural & Engineering provisions of FAR Part 36 and DFARS Part 236. This announcement is being issued on an unrestricted basis and is for the selection of an Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Firm for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the State of Wisconsin (Wisconsin Air National Guard / Wisconsin Army National Guard).  Firms must be capable of concurrently responding to and working on multiple projects simultaneously. The selection of a Firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria. All Firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR Part 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest; and FAR 36.209 Construction contracts with architect-engineer firms. Large Firms, if selected, will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS subpart 219.7 as part of any Request for Proposal package. The subcontracting plan is NOT required with the Firms SF 330.<BR><BR>SCOPE OF SERVICES: The United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) for Wisconsin intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price performance based Architectural & Engineering (A-E) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Options for use by National Guard activities throughout the State of Wisconsin (Wisconsin Air National Guard / Wisconsin Army National Guard). The A-E IDIQ contract will be established for a base period of one (1) year with options exercisable for four (4) successive one (1) year option periods. A contract minimum of $1,000 and a cumulative $10 Million ceiling will apply for the duration of the contract with no limit on individual Task order amounts. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Orders are anticipated to be awarded against the A-E IDIQ contract. The Government anticipates that this announcement will result in the award of one contract to provide services to each of three (3) primary locations: (General Mitchell International Airport, Milwaukee, WI; Truax Field, Madison, WI; Volk Field Air National Guard Base, Camp Douglas, WI); in addition to supporting locations/activities on a statewide basis. Accordingly, the contract will cover the primary locations but may also result in the issuance of task orders for locations/activities throughout the State of Wisconsin. By making a submission pursuant to this announcement, the submitting Firm acknowledges that task orders may be issued for all National Guard locations throughout the State of Wisconsin. The A-E IDIQ contract anticipated to be awarded will encompass an initial base year period with four (4) one year option periods. Individual Task Orders anticipated to be issued under the A-E IDIQ contract may include services under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Firms are advised that under such circumstances RECOVERY Act reporting requirements and contract clauses will be applicable to the Task Orders. The Architectural and Engineering Services for which Task Orders may be issued may include: a). Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; b). Rehabilitation of existing facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; c). Design of projects on Army or Air Force installations; d). Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria; e). Sustainable design utilizing LEED rating tools; f). Preparation of the development of the technical information for design-build Request for Proposals; g). Development of construction cost estimates and schedules; h). Design of Demolition; i). Comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations; and j) Construction phase services including commissioning, shop drawing review and preparation of O&M manuals. <BR><BR>EVALUATION: The Governments selection of the best value contractor is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s). Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the contract in view of the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services) evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team. Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team. The key positions should include: Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors. Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES. FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s). FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years) evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules. FACTOR 4 Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time) evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods. FACTOR 5 Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to Madison, WI and knowledge of the identified locality) evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from the LOCATION and the extent of the Firms knowledge of the LOCATION and knowledge/experience concerning state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract. FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months) in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement. FACTOR 7 Small Business Participation evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner. FACTORS 1 & 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 3, 4 & 5 which are each weighted EQUAL. FACTORS 1 & 2 are also SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT than FACTORS 6 & 7 which are weighted EQUAL and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal. Relative to FACTOR 5 Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a firms project team(s) is not co-located in the same office.<BR><BR>SUBMISSION FORMAT: Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission. Submitting firms are to include the DUNS number along with the name of the firm in Block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, Section B. A firm located within the United States may obtain a DUNS number by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com/us/. If a submitting Firm is located outside the United States, the local Dun and Bradstreet office should be contacted. Relative to all submittals, FONT SIZE shall be at least 10 point or larger (MS Word Font Size 10 for Times New Roman, Arial and Courier New fonts are examples of the minimum acceptable Font Size). Except as otherwise indicated, pages shall be 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches. Where page limits are indicated for Parts/Sections of the SF 330, excess pages will not be read or considered. Each side of a sheet of paper shall be counted as a single page. Blank sheets or tabs separating the sections within the SF 330 will not count toward any page limitation. The Organizational Chart required in Section D and the Matrix required as Section G, may be presented on sheets up to 11 inches by 17 inches. If an 11 inch by 17 inch sheet is used it shall be neatly folded to 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches and bound in the SF 330 at the proper location. All key personnel for whom resumes are provided shall be shown on the organizational chart in Section D. Resumes in Section E shall not exceed two (2) pages each. Multiple Resumes may be reflected on a single page. Resumes shall be provided for the qualified professional personnel indicated in FACTOR 1, above. Professional licenses, registrations, and/or certifications shall be specifically identified on resumes and the failure to indentify a license, registration and/or certification will result in a presumption that none exists for the individual for whom the Resume is offered. A maximum of Ten (10) projects including the prime and consultants will be reviewed in Section F. No more than one (1) page should be used for each project. Multiple projects may be reflected on a single page. When listing projects in Section F, an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) with multiple Task Orders as examples is not considered a project. Multiple task orders that are associated with a single project may be used and will be considered a single project; however, listing a single contract with task orders that may be unrelated is not considered a single project. A task order executed under an IDC contract is a project. In Block G-26, along with the name, include the firm with which the person is associated. Section H shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages. Indication of favorable performance ratings, awards, and repeat clientele in Section H is recommended. An SF 330 PART II is required for each branch office of the Prime Firm and any Subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract. <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with Multiparameter Water Quality Sonde and Associated Equipment (1) month following the award of contract, for the Office of Research & Development (ORD), National RiskManagement Research Lab (NRMRL), Ground Water and Ecosystems Restoration Research (GWERD) located in Ada, OK.
   The Mount Sopris CIFA-1000 multiparameter water quality probe is needed to acquire in situ groundwater quality data for deep wells as part of site characterization activities at research and technical assistance sites.  The CIFA-1000 logging sonde will collect in situ temperature, electrical conductivity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, pH, redox, nitrate, ammonia and chloride data in wells to depths greater than 2000 feet below land surface using our existing geophysical logging system. Ground Water and Ecosystems Restoration Research's (GWERD) Century Geophysical logging rig will be used to operate the multiparameter probe in conjunction with other existing probes. A multiparameter water quality logging sonde and associated equipment will allow simultaneous collection of temperature, electrical conductivity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, pH, redox, nitrate, ammonia and chloride data.  The CIFA-1000 will also be used to quantify vertical changes in groundwater quality in long-screened and open hole wells.  Only one company, Mount Sopris Instrument Company, Inc. (MSI), provides a logging sonde that will meet the specified requirements. MSI modifies probes manufactured by Idronaut to be used on MSI logging systems. The cable heads, connecting cables and Matrix electronics are sold by one company (MSI).EPA has identified Mount Sopris Instrument Company Inc. (MSI) as the only provider of commercial equipment able to meet the requirements of this procurement.   Subsequently EPA has determined that Mount Sopris Instrument Company Inc. (MSI) is the only manufacturer that can provide instrument that can meet the specifications listed above.
	 This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified above. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.

<CONTACT>Agnes Cserhati, Contracting Specialist, Phone 3614754962, Email acserhati@usaid.gov
<DESC><p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC), Budapest, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Albania, in anticipation of the procurement of a cost plus fixed fee completion contract that will implement a five year project entitled the "Enabling Equitable Health Reforms" in Albania. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Key system-level factors/challenges limit the capacity of the Albanian Health Care system to provide quality care to its citizens, especially the poor. Those factors are: A disconnect between the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">de jure</span> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">de facto</span> legal frameworks; unresolved funding issues for the Health Sector; questionable financial sustainability; weak management structure; Informality and corruption.</span></p>
<p>To successfully address these challenges, it is essential that the GoA's steps to reform its health sector should aim to installing a culture of lawfulness. EEHR will adapt a comprehensive approach to help Albania move forward with its reform agenda. It is designed to contribute to the overarching goal of improving access of health services for the poor by a) helping remove the existing barriers and constraints to a responsive health care system for all Albanians, especially the poor, and b) field testing approaches and tools that define a feasible package of reforms. Moreover <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>this activity will be adopting a horizontal institutional approach to the reforms and will be implemented by working closely with the Albanian institutional players, stakeholders and donor organizations, particularly with the WHO and WB to: identify their institutional concerns/issues/objections/constraints; establish a consensus among the parties regarding feasible approaches; develop implementation/action plans and tools that address these issues;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>integrate sub laws, regulations and policies into health service operations; field test implementation of the action plans and the tools at the regional level; and use the lessons learned at the regional level to adopt national level reforms.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The five year project will develop the operational plans, enabling legislation, and enforcement measures needed to facilitate, guide and inform national implementation of GoA health reforms. Field tests of implementation approaches and reform tools in pilot region(s) will help define the parameters, priorities and effective means of application to improve and expand health services for the poor at the regional level. The design and results of the field tests will help narrow the agenda to a feasible set of priority actions that will have the greatest impact nationally. </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This will be a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>12. STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Rwanda's government has set an ambitious development agenda that aims to transform the country from a subsistence agriculture-based economy to a middle income and knowledge-based economy. To achieve this vision, the GOR has publicly stated its commitment to strengthening the rule of law, civil liberties, and political rights, and to promoting good governance and greater civic participation in political life and policy-making. These aspirations are articulated in the GOR's Vision 2020 and the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy 2008-2012 (EDPRS), which guides government efforts and donor assistance in the country.</p>
<p>As a result of Rwanda's decentralization process, there are now mechanisms and systems in place that have the potential to enable greater participation and empowerment of citizens in the planning and delivery of services. Still, while there is a shift toward greater participation, the GOR has tended to focus on providing information to the general public about government policies, plans and programs. This approach, which often involves radio announcements by the national government or announcements at cell or village-level meetings, has the advantage of getting information out, but offers limited opportunities for obtaining feedback from citizens. Civil society organizations sometimes attempt to expand the breadth and depth of information dissemination and education. However, due to limited capacity and other constraints, opportunities are still limited for citizens and civil society organizations to fully engage government officials with their priorities and concerns pertaining to local development and service delivery that government undertakes and/or implements for their benefit.</p>
<p>USAID/Rwanda's Democracy and Governance activities, including the Rwanda Threshold Program, are designed to reinforce and extend efforts already underway by the GOR, USAID/Rwanda, and other donors to promote civil rights and civic participation, contribute to the achievement of the GOR's goals for good governance and reconciliation, and accelerate its progress in strengthening the rule of law, citizen participation, civil society, and media freedom. In addition, the DG Team works with and manages activities funded by other USAID/Rwanda programs, such as Health (particularly the President's Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS, USAID/Rwanda's largest program), Economic Growth, and Education.<br /><br />BASIC FUNCTION:</p>
<p>The Democracy and Governance Officer will serve as the Team Leader of the USAID/Rwanda Democracy and Governance Team and as the principal consultant to USAID/Rwanda senior management on all issues and programs pertaining to democracy and governance development.</p>
<p>The DG Officer will be responsible for: 1) managing the USAID/Rwanda Democracy and Governance Team; 2) devising appropriate strategies and plans for supporting the development of democracy in Rwanda; 3) leading the design and implementation of cost-effective programs that produce meaningful results in strengthening DG; 4) facilitating the proper coordination and integration of USAID democracy activities within the Mission's portfolio and with other USG Agencies including the Embassy and MCC; 5) ensuring that all Mission DG activities are coordinated with, complementary to, and supportive of similar assistance activities of other U.S. government agencies; 6) manage the activities developed under the MCC Threshold program pertaining to Democracy and Governance; 7) ensuring that the design and implementation of all DG activities are fully coordinated with international organizations and bilateral donors active in this area; and 8) providing policy advice and analyses to senior Mission management on topics related to democratic development in Rwanda.</p>
<p>The DG Officer will serve as a principal technical resource on democracy and governance development and as the Mission's primary point of contact on matters related to programming under USAID's Strategic Objective, "Improved Governance through Increased Citizen Participation," and the Rwanda MCC Threshold Program, which was designed and is being implemented in partnership with the GOR and in close consultation with the MCC and the U.S. Embassy.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Mitigating measures to address unacceptable settlement will have to be taken due to the presence of highly compressible soils within the project area.  A potential for methane gas beneath the proposed building site exists, and therefore a methane gas collection, venting, and detection system will be required as part of the site preparation.  Other sitework includes site utilities, grading, constructing new sidewalks and parking areas, landscaping, and the construction of a 120-foot communications tower.  A new emergency generator and fuel tank will also be supplied adjacent to the new building.

The Contractor shall provide interior systems furniture plans, designed and coordinated with the building construction.  An interior designer currently holding a Professional level membership in the America Society of Interior Designers shall select all interior systems and finishes.  

The Government intends to include optional bid items in the solicitation to be awarded pending funds availability.  The work includes (1) demolition of a one story, approximately 21,000 SF building immediately adjacent to the site of the new building; (2) demolition of an approximately 1,200 SF building on site; (3) construction of approximately 1,200 LF of ornamental fence around the perimeter of the base; and (4) burying approximately 240 LF of overhead electrical and telecommunication lines near the entrance to the Base.

The design proposals shall incorporate energy efficient design and construction and shall include sustainable design features sufficient for the Contractor to obtain a silver rating by the U.S. Green Building Council LEED-NC Version 3.0.  

The estimated price range of this project is between $10M and $25M.  The USCG will be utilizing a two-phase Design-Build selection procedure. The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition, and are encouraged to register in the Interested Vendors List in FedBizOpps for this project.

For consideration on this project, the offeror, at a minimum, must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope, not necessarily design-build.  

The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, life safety, or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Ohio to practice in the particular professional field involved.  This solicitation is restricted to small business concerns.  The Phase One solicitation will be available for download in FedBizOpps on or about 23 April 2010.

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy (DE) Contracting Division on behalf of the AFRL Directed Energy Technology Directorate (RDLA), Kirtland AFB NM, intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(i) to the University of Alabama Birmingham, Center for Optical Sensors and Spectroscopies, Department of Phsyics, for Investigation of Co, Ni, and Fe doped II-VI Chalcogenides. The contemplated contract is a twenty-seven month effort with an approximate value of $300,000.</p>
<p>Middle-infrared (mid-IR) laser sources are in great demand for numerous defense-related applications such as infrared aircraft countermeasures, monitoring of munitions disposal, stand-off detection of explosion hazards, eyesafe seekers for smart munitions and cruise missiles, covert communications systems, and injection seeding of high power chemical (e.g. HF) lasers. <br />Mid-IR wavelengths are usually generated using relatively complex nonlinear optical conversion techniques or by means of direct generation in hetero-junction lead-salt, antimonide, or quantum cascade semiconductor lasers featuring limited output power and tuning range. Impurity doped crystalline vibronic lasers, having a gain bandwidth up to 50% of central wavelength, constitute another viable route for broadly tunable mid-IR coherent sources. Among them transition metal (TM2+, e.g., Cr2+ or Fe2+) doped binary (e.g., ZnSe, ZnS, CdSe, CdS, ZnTe) and ternary (e.g., CdMnTe, CdZnTe, ZnSSe) chalcogenide crystals represent a relatively new class of solid state gain media with strong and ultra-broad absorption and emission bands in the mid-IR range of optical spectra. <br />Active interest in TM doped II-VI compounds is inspired by the fact that these media are close mid-IR analogs of the titanium-doped sapphire (Ti-S) in terms of spectroscopic and laser characteristics. It was anticipated that TM2+ doped chalcogenides would lase in the mid-IR with a great variety of A77pahmalH24$*8 possible modes of oscillation, similar to the Ti-S laser. Indeed, optically pumped RT lasers based on Cr:ZnS, Cr:ZnSe, Cr:Cd1-xMnxTe, Cr:CdSe, and Fe:ZnSe crystals providing access to the 2-3 and 3.8-5 &micro;m spectral regions with high (up to 70%) efficiency, multi-Watt-level output powers, tunability in excess of 1000 nm, and narrow spectral linewidth (&lt;20 MHz), have been reported by several groups Arguably these lasers represent nowadays the simplest and the most cost-effective route for high power, broadly tunable lasing in the 2-3 and 3.8-5 &micro;m wavelength ranges.<br />There are still several challenges to be overcome for development of affordable high power TM:II-VI lasers continuously covering 2-5 &micro;m spectral range. Among them are:<br />1) Lack of developed gain materials capable to effectively operate over currently unavailable 3-4 &micro;m spectral range.<br />2) Lack of convenient pump sources for 3.8-5 &micro;m Fe:ZnSe lasers<br />3) Lack of TM:II-VI gain materials pumped by the radiation of readily available neodymium or ytterbium lasers. <br />To address the enumerated challenges the following objectives for this project are proposed. <br />1.0 Project Objectives</p>
<p>1. Development of technology of high optical quality gain elements based on Co2+ doped ZnSe crystals promising for room-temperature lasing over 3-4 &micro;m spectral range. <br />2. Fabrication and characterization of Co2+:ZnSe experimental samples lasing over 3-4 &micro;m spectral range under Er-fiber, 808 nm diode, and/or Alexandrite laser pumping. <br />3. Development of technology of high optical quality gain elements based on Ni2+ co-doped Co2+:ZnSe crystals promising for room-temperature lasing over 3-4 &micro;m spectral range via energy transfer pass from Ni to Co. <br />4. Fabrication and characterization of Ni2+ co-doped Co2+:ZnSe experimental samples for 3-4 &micro;m lasing under Yb-fiber and/or Nd laser pumping. <br />5. Development of technology of high optical quality gain elements based on Co2+ co-doped Fe:ZnSe crystals promising for room-temperature lasing over 3.8-5.2 &micro;m spectral range via energy transfer pass from Co to Fe. <br />6. Fabrication and characterization of Co2+ co-doped Fe2+:ZnSe experimental samples for 3.8-5.2 &micro;m lasing under Er-fiber and/or 808 nm diode laser pumping via energy transfer pass from Co to Fe</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source, Gentex Corporation, 324 Main Street, Simpson, PA  18407 for SPH5-C flight helmet parts. This action is authorized by and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement is Gentex Corporation.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $158,000.00. No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1). The requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 339113 applies. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item L10PS02264. However, they must provide convincing evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost. All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by April 14, 2010 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Gentex Corporation for the requirement stated here. Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Diane Barker at 208-387-5358 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<SUBJECT>Standardization Program to Improve the Clinical Measurement of Glycohemoglobin & C-peptide

<CONTACT>Richard Jenkins, Phone 7704882604, Email rjenkins@cdc.gov - Richard Jenkins, Phone 7704882604, Email rjenkins@cdc.gov
<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong>. "This is a Non-Research and Development (NonR &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential NonR &amp; D requirement." The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541380, Size Standard is $10.0 Mil.
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been and is actively represented on the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) Steering Committee, which has a critical role in the operation of the program. Of major interest to CDC is the established primary reference method, the availability of QC and reference materials, and comparative performance data analysis. CDC, Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences has been funded and charged with the task to improve diagnostic care for diabetes. Specific goals include providing improved measurement of GHB testing through long term standardization of current and emerging test methods, developing a definitive reference method for HbA1c, and developing methods and interventions for improved care of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder characterized by insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and high risk for development of complications of the eyes, kidneys, peripheral nerves, heart and blood vessels. The disease is highly prevalent, affecting as many as 16 million people in the U.S. Trends show that minority and elderly populations are disproportionately affected by diabetes. It is estimated that approximately 1 in every 7 health care dollars spent in the U.S. goes to diabetes care - mostly for treatment of the chronic complications. In the U.S., diabetes is the most common cause of blindness in young adults, kidney failure, and non-traumatic limb amputation.</p>
<p>The landmark nine-year Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), completed in 1993, showed conclusively that the risk for development and progression of the chronic complications in patients with type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus is directly related to blood glucose control as assessed by serial glycohemoglobin (GHB or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) determinations. GHB was determined to be a reliable index of average blood glucose during the previous 2-3 months that could be used routinely to monitor glycemic control in diabetic individuals. Based on the DCCT results, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) developed a series of specific diabetes treatment goals using GHB as an index of mean blood glucose. However, the fact that GHB assay methods had not been well standardized among laboratories prevented optimal use of the test. Subsequent studies showed the advantages and feasibility of standardizing GHB assays, and a candidate reference method for GHB was proposed.</p>
<p>Because of the positive impact standardization of GHB determinations would have on the care of diabetic patients, the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) Standards Committee established a GHB Standardization Subcommittee in April 1993 - with active representation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of the subcommittee was to develop a plan for GHB standardization that would ultimately allow individual clinical laboratories to relate their GHB assay results to those of large-scale studies such as the DCCT, where relationships of GHB values to mean blood glucose and to risks for developing chronic diabetic complications have been established.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Purpose and Objective</strong>. The purpose of this project is to establish and operate a standardization program for glycohemoglobin (GHB) testing so that clinical laboratory results are comparable to those values reported in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The contractor will be required to: (1) establish and maintain the DCCT primary reference method; (2) establish a network of reference laboratories, all of which maintain reference methods or precise methods traceable to the reference method; (3) monitor Network Laboratories monthly to meet monitoring criteria; (4) interact with manufacturers of GHB methods through the Network, providing assistance in standardizing their methods and then providing comparison data for certification of traceability to the DCCT; (5) provide assessment of effectiveness of the program through evaluation of independent Proficiency Testing data from College of American Pathologists (CAP); (6) provide data and reference materials to assist CDC in the development of definitive reference method; (7) establish and maintain a C-peptide standardization program for select laboratories following guidelines provided.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirement</strong>. The contractor shall, as an independent organization, and not as an agent of the Government, furnish all labor, materials, facilities, and equipment necessary to establish and maintain a GHB standardization program following the American Association of Clinical Chemistry (AACC) Standards Committee's protocol. The program shall establish and monitor a voluntary network of reference laboratories for GHB testing, which, in turn, interact with manufacturers of GHB methods to (1) assist in standardizing their methods; and (2) provide comparison data for certification of traceability to DCCT primary reference method. Two elements are key in the design of the program: (1) an Administrative Center to coordinate certification processes, analyze certification and monitoring data, and issue certificates of traceability; and (2) a Central Primary Reference Laboratory that analyzes GHB by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Bio-Rex 70 resin, sets the initial calibration based on the "set-point" used in the DCCT, and administers a monitoring program for all certified laboratories. (Voluntary primary reference laboratories, which serve as back-up laboratories for the central laboratory, and secondary reference laboratories, which maintain methods traceable to the central laboratory, assist manufacturers in standardizing their methods, and provide comparison data for certification.) Note that a "steering committee" was established to provide expert direction and review for the NGSP and is expected to continue in this capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong>. The period of performance shall be a Base year of 12-month and One (1) 12 month option year.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement /Information sought</strong>. Please explain, in detail, your experience, knowledge and ability to provide the following:<br />Your opinion about the difficulty and or feasibility of the potential requirement or proposed acquisition, possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace, and information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.<br />Your staff expertise, including your availability, experience, and formal and other training. Your current in house capability and capacity to perform the work. Your completed projects of similar nature. Your corporate experience and management capability. Provide any examples of prior completed Government contracts, reference, and other related information.<br />Provide a rough order of magnitude (estimate cost) of the effort or time that may be required for completion of the work.<br />The Government will not return capability statements received.</p>
<p>Information Submission Instructions: Please include a cover page with the following business information:</p>
<p>a) DUNS:<br />b) Organization name and address<br />c) Do you have a Government approved accounting system? If so, please identify the agency <br />that approved the system.<br />d) Business size and type of business, (e. g., small business, 8(a), woman owned, veteran owned, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code 541380, size standards which is $10.0 M. <br />e) Point of Contact, phone, fax and email address of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the response.</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
<p>Title of Project: Retrospective collection of child protective service reports among National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project.</p>
<p>Introduction: This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement." The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541720.</p>
<p>Background: Early Head Start was initiated in response to the 1994 Head Start reauthorization. This comprehensive, two-generation program includes intensive services that begin before the child is born and concentrate on enhancing the child's development and supporting the family during the critical first three years of life. In the authorizing legislation, Congress mandated a rigorous evaluation of the new initiative.</p>
<p>To evaluate the impact of EHS, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has been conducting an ongoing large-scale (3001 families), multisite (17 sites across the US ), and randomized controlled trial (National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project). Children and families were randomly assigned to the Early Head Start program and a control group at the time they applied for program services. Children and families were followed while in the program and follow-ups were conducted in the spring prior to children's entry into Kindergarten and again in fifth grade. Findings from this trial consistently show more positive outcomes for intervention children and their parents as compared to controls that include higher mental and language development scores; a more stimulating home environment for EHS children; more emotionally supportive parenting and a reduction in spanking among EHS parents. These data suggest that the intervention has contributed to more nurturing relationships for children but there have been no assessments of actual child maltreatment collected at any time during this study.</p>
<p>EHS offers children and family's comprehensive child development services through center-based, home-based, and a mixed program options. Although there is evidence that home-based services to parents beginning prenatally and continuing through the first two years can impact parenting and child maltreatment rates, we lack evidence of the impact of mixed home visits and center- or center-based child care with parental involvement such as that provided by some of the EHS programs. In addition to promoting nurturing relationships, mixed home-center or center-based child care might influence the occurrence of child maltreatment directly, and they might moderate or mediate individual- and family-level risk or protective factors.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: This research contract is to collect retrospective data on family involvement with the child welfare system for five sites (n=750) and to use these data to answer the following questions:<br />&bull; How many parents in the sample have been involved in the child welfare system (report, substantiated report, out-of-home placement)?<br />&bull; Does the percentage of parents involved in the child welfare system significantly differ between EHS participants and the control sample?<br />&bull; Was EHS involved in the reporting (potential surveillance bias)?<br />&bull; How does this link with other risk data? (i.e., family demographic risks, family conflict, discipline, social networks, observed parenting behaviors)? <br />&bull; What are the factors that increase or decrease these children's risk of maltreatment, and to what extent does EHS play a role in buffering these risks?</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The project will require:<br />- Number and rate of parental involvement in the child welfare system (substantiated reports and out-of-home placements) for the five National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project sites sample and by intervention group; <br />- Proportional likelihood (or other measure of association) of involvement in the child welfare system by intervention group, adjusted for family demographic risks and family conflict; <br />- Risk ratios for associations between family demographic risks, family conflict, discipline, social networks, observed parenting behaviors and involvement in the child welfare system;</p>
<p>Throughout this entire contract period CDC will provide input on the implementation of the study protocol. The contractor shall work collaboratively with CDC and be responsible for documenting progress during each phase of the contract. CDC will be intricately involved in all phases of this project and will provide leadership or collaborative input as coauthors on all presentations, publications, or manuscripts that result from this contract.</p>

<SOLNBR>AMD-10-SS73
<RESPDATE>041810
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Tunable Spectral Confocal System in support of projects in NISTs Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory. 

The general mission of the Biomaterials Group of NISTs Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory is to develop measurement methods, standards, and data that quantify response of cells and tissues to biomaterials and account for the complexity inherent in biological  materials systems interactions. The laboratorys existing laser scanning confocal microscope uses old opto-mechanical technology and is very limited in its ability to see deeply into highly scattering systems such as cells in porous polymers when compared to current confocal systems that use new technology with much higher sensitivity. The group also studies biomaterials in three dimensions (3D) and/or with continually varying properties and often collects large volumes of data. The required microscope is capable of very rapid acquisition and is upgradable to different imaging modalities (i.e. multiphoton, super resolution, fluorescence lifetime techniques).

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a Tunable Spectral Confocal System that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

NIST has a need for a Tunable Spectral Confocal System that would meet the following requirements:

The required instrument is an upright laser scanning confocal microscope system that uses prism based spectrophotometer detection for fully tunable and gapless detection from 400 to 800 nm. This detection  must be dichroic and bandpass free. The smallest detection bandwidth must be less than 6 nm to separate overlapping fluorophores.

NICHD is seeking information on the capabilities and limitations of organizations interested in providing the services described below. 

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside. All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541990 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is $7M. 

Background:
The ICBG research project is a grant award to a consortia of diverse partners including researchers in the U.S. and developing countries, industrial partners such as pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies, non-government organizations and national governments to look for new drugs, agrochemicals and energy agents from natural products and to contribute to biodiversity conservation in those countries. A proprietary database called NAPIS by the current contractor, White Point Systems, has been established that captures the natural products drug discovery data stream.  The purposes of the Global Data Center are (1) to provide support, facilitate use, and provide training for the members of each current ICBG; (2) to provide management support to Fogarty International Center by maintaining a global dataset and providing reports and performing queries on the global dataset on a regular basis; (3) to enlist experts and coordinate an analysis and evaluation of the cumulative data from the ICBG program from its inception in 1993 through the end of the current contract period; and (4) to disseminate nonproprietary products of the ICBGs to other ICBGs and to the international community by providing and maintaining a public website with information by and about the ICBGs and containing topics, tools, and links of interest to the Program.

Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise: 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall accomplish the following tasks with respect to the Global Data Center:

1)	Provide a robust, secure, and confidential relational database that can capture information throughout the natural products agent discovery pipeline.  Data fields accommodate data from field collections, extractions and fractionation, diverse bioassays in multiple therapeutic areas, chemical isolation (with standardization of chemical drawing in ISIS/Base for chemical similarity and sub-structural analysis), medicinal chemistry, and pre-clinical development of compounds and botanicals.  The Contractor shall provide a license for the database during the period of this contract for use by ICBG project investigators during the period of the ICBG awards.  

2)	Maintain and support the use of this database by the grantees.  The Contractor will purchase and configure the laptops for security, and install the database and appropriate software (e.g. for security) ready for use. The Contractor will provide standard service support to include user support, minor software revisions, and document revisions, as well as more customized support to each ICBG on a more limited basis.  The improved features of NAPIS developed during a previous contract with WPS will be deployed and used during this contract, such as NAPIS Web 1.0.  In addition, the Contractor shall respond to other informatics requests such as those concerned with data manipulation and any network, database administration, and customization requirements that are ICBG project specific.  Support shall be provided to the data manager for each ICBG, who in turn will support other team members.

3)	Provide training to users in the US and in partnering low and middle income countries.  

4)	Provide cleaned and verified data sets and associated data analysis summary reports to the FIC Project Officer as part of required semi-annual reporting. The Contractor shall solicit and obtain an updated dataset from each ICBG semi-annually and integrate the new datasets into the Global database. The contractor shall solicit the data from each ICBG in either the database or in one of the agreed upon formats (e.g. Access or Excel tables) for each of the required fields in the Field Biology, Bioassay, and Chemistry modules.  With the assistance of the Contractor, the Reports used by the ICBGs and additional specialized Reports will be applied to the Global dataset to look for emergent patterns of information, to compare data across the projects for commonalities, overlap, and biases, and to prepare summaries that can be used by FIC to evaluate, make useful interventions, and fulfill reporting requirements about the program. 

5)	To address emerging needs of the Program, the Contractor will develop a data link for emerging genomic information to samples from microbial communities and individual specimens.  In addition, a limited number of customized Reports and links to specialized databases may be requested for use by individual Groups, at the discretion of the FIC Project Officer. 


6)	In the final year of the contract, in close consultation with the Project Officer and ICBG, assemble subject area experts and carry out a detailed analysis of the combined and cumulative data since Program inception to be used for program evaluation and to support dissemination to the scientific community of metadata and lessons learned on best practices in natural products drug discovery. 

7)	Maintain the website www.icbg.org/  for use by the Groups and as a public face and archival record of the ICBG Program.  Wherever possible, links to other sites (for example: FIC, individual ICBGs, and other relevant public websites) will be employed.   The site includes a search function for the total site and for specific content areas (such as "bibliography of ICBG publications").  Examples of content areas include the following:  bibliography of ICBG publications; bibliography of publications about the ICBG Program; links to ICBG bioinventory published databases; links to ICBG-specific websites maintained by individual ICBGs; ICBG shareable resources (for example, workshop materials); announcements of relevant upcoming grants or meetings and other pertinent natural products news items; examples of redacted ICBG contracts concerning access and benefit sharing; general links useful to natural products drug discovery (for example, the clearinghouse of the Convention on Biological Diversity); and descriptions of permit requirements in participating countries.  The Contractor shall actively search for material to augment and improve the site.  In addition, the FIC Project Officer or the ICBGs will provide material (such as the shareable resources, announcements, and ICBG publications mentioned above), to the Contractor's web manager for posting and will request removal of material that is no longer timely.   The Web site will not contain dynamic material.

Interested organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit electronic copies in addition to four (4) hard copies of their capability statement, addressing the areas above. Please limit responses to fifteen (15) pages or less. Any proprietary information should be so marked. Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer by no later than 3:00 PM local time on April 19, 2010. Capability statements must identify the business status of the organization (i.e. educational institution, non-profit, large business, small business, 8 (a), or other corporate or non-corporate entity). NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO THE 4 HARD COPIES. 

Responses should be no more than 15 pages. These pages exclude resumes.

<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Gloucester, MA., intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for the installation, configuration and maintenance of Pulse Software <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>for our existing Pulse <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platform.. This platform serves as a critical data collection tool in the soon to be implemented Fisheries Sector Management Program. The increased importance of the IVR function requires a reliable backup server to be installed that provides redundancy. As Pulse Voice's proprietary software resides on the primary server, so must the backup server be configured with only Pulse Voice Inc. software. The back up server, pre-loaded with Pulse Voice programs and configuration will minimize any downtime should the primary server fail. The Pulse Voice program and scripts are proprietary and no other vendor can supply a compatible service.</p>

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is initiating a program to develop and procure the next generation ground based targeting system.  The program is referenced herein as Common Laser Range Finder (CLRF) Refresh program.  The Targeting and Engagement Systems Center of Excellence (TESCE) aboard NSWC Dahlgren will host an Industry Day the week of 16-20 August 2010.  The objective of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to issue a call for white papers from industry, academia, laboratories, and other developers on technologies and system integration efforts relevant to the USMC's ground based targeting needs, specifically those relating to the CLRF Refresh program.  White Papers submitted in response to this announcement will be used to screen and invite attendees to the Industry Day.  The government reserves the right to select or deny any party for presenting at or attending the Industry Day event.
This Industry Day will focus on optics and azimuth technologies and system integrators.  The government is interested in innovative technologies and components that are lighter, smaller, require less electrical power, are more accurate, reliable, and have additional functionality than currently fielded ground-based targeting systems.  The government is also interested in innovative approaches to integrate multiple capabilities into a single hand-held system.
Based on the contents of the white papers, submitters may be selected to present at the Industry Day.  This Industry Day will be divided into six sessions:
1)	The government will brief all attendees addressing the CLRF Refresh program followed by a question and answer session2)	Open-forum presentations by component technology providers to a mixed government and industry audience.  The intent of these open forum presentations is to allow companies who desire to be technology providers to make potential industry partners aware of their work efforts and capabilities.  This open forum will be open to all technologies related to CLRF Refresh including but not limited to optics, azimuth determination, laser spot viewing, eye-safe range finding, day and night target recognition sensors.  3)	One-on-one closed-forum presentations to a government-only audience (including select support contractors) by technology providers who do not wish to present in front of potential industry partners, or who wish to provide additional information to a government-only audience that was not provided in their open-forum presentation.  4)	One-on-one closed-forum presentations by system integrators to a government-only audience (including select support contractors).  5)	Open-forum demonstrations of relevant equipment by technology providers to all government and system integrator attendees in an outdoor operationally-representative environment.  Participation in the field demonstration is encouraged, but not required.  Systems participating in the field demonstration may be subject to a safety review - especially for any systems emitting laser energy.  TESCE, the host of the Industry Day, may wish to record data/video feeds from equipment being demonstrated.  Presenters may choose to allow the government to record the performance of their equipment.  Any recorded data will be used solely for documenting the state of the art of the technologies being demonstrated to allow the government to refine future requirements to fit within the realm of technical feasibility.  No data recorded shall be used for any possible future procurements or source selection evaluations.6)	Closed-forum demonstrations of relevant equipment to a government-only audience in an outdoor operationally-representative environment.  Participation in the field demonstration is encouraged, but not required.  Systems participating in the field demonstration may be subject to a safety review - especially for any systems emitting laser energy.  TESCE, the host of the Industry Day, may wish to record data/video feeds from equipment being demonstrated.  Presenters may choose to allow the government to record the performance of their equipment.  Any recorded data will be used solely for documenting the state of the art technologies being demonstrated to allow the government to refine future requirements to fit within the realm of technical feasibility.  No data recorded shall be used for any possible future procurements or source selection evaluations.
In reference to sessions 2, 3, and 4, the government will provide invitees with template slides that must be presented first.  Beyond that, invitees are allowed to present in any format they choose within the allocated timeframe.  
In reference to sessions 5 and 6, participants have the option to choose whether they will allow the government to record the performance of their equipment.
Questions should be directed to Bonnie Impastato, (Code CXS11-4), Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110, or email to bonnie.impastato@navy.mil.

System Characteristics:
Two system configurations are anticipated to be developed under the CLRF Refresh program: CLRF Refresh "Light" and "Medium".  The CLRF Refresh Light version will be a smaller and lighter system with limited capabilities tailored for use by foot-mobile Marines at shorter ranges.  The CLRF Refresh Medium version will meet all of the CLRF Refresh requirements under all operational environments in a size and weight tailored for use by vehicle-mobile Marines.  The focus of the CLRF Refresh Medium system is on longer engagement ranges and incorporating as many of the objectives into the system as possible.  The target recognition ranges may be achieved using various techniques.  For example, a wide field of view may be used to detect a target, and a narrow field of view may be used to recognize the target.  A second example is the use of gated/flash-illuminated imagery to capture a still image that the operator may use to recognize a target once it has been detected in a passive imaging video mode.  The intent is not to allow continuous illumination that may compromise the user's position.  
Note: The USMC currently uses the following systems:  AN/PEQ-13 Common Laser Range Finder (CLRF), AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), IZLID 1000P IR Pointer, AN/PAS-22 Long Range Thermal Imager (LRTI), AN/PVS-14 Night Vision Monocular, and the AN/PAS-25 Thermal Laser Spot Imager (TLSI).  These devices will be available for use during the equipment demonstration events.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is seeking sources for a multi-channel signal data recorder for use with its Carry on Equipment (COE) program. Today up to five IF inputs as well as diverse ancillary inputs must be addressed.  The architecture must be open for future expansion of bandwidths and/or transition to alternative IF frequencies as well as possible increase in the total number of data inputs.  Future upgrades could include the need for coherent files produced for the multiple input streams.  
A commercial off the shelf system is preferred, though not required. The recording solution must meet the following criteria:
1) Personnel-  The recording solution will be operated, installed, and maintained by military personnel; 
2) Interfaces- The recorder solution must interface with the host COE.  The recorder must permit remote control of all recorder functions via an operator/maintenance graphical user interface(GUI).  The GUI must be written in a language permitting it to operate with multiple computer operating systems; 
3)Data storage format and form- the final file format must be in Platinum data format.  The specification for the Platinum format will be provided as a part of the RFP package should an RFP be issued. The final storage solution is required to be economical, transportable and reliable; 
4)Equipment protection- the final recorder solution requires a transport case protecting it from potential damage during its transport/install/de-install life; 
5)Data feeds -today's system has six 160 MHz IF channels at 80 MHz bandwidth available for recording. The system can be reconfigured to provide four 1 GHz IF channels at 500 MHz bandwidth. Future systems may use these IF values but the number of available channels may increase; 
6)Ancillary feeds - One 1-PPS timing feed; one time code input; up to four video feeds. Additional ancillary feeds may be required of future systems; 
7)  Voice input - One physically and electronically isolated voice input channel and associated storage; 
8)Storage/Transport Environment - The recorder solution will be a part of a larger equipment suite used by the COE program.  These suites of equipment are stored in government facilities.  When ordered by management, install teams bundle a set of equipment for shipping to the install location.  The recorder solution will be part of a set of equipment which may get palletized and moved by forklift.  Transport is often not palletized; equipment is in its transport case but experiences heavy shock/vibration as it transits an industrial complex.  Equipment is moved by government pick up truck, commercial carrier (semi trailer), or rail.  Install often requires handling in areas where a dropped case may occur.
9) Operating Environment- The recorder must be 19-inch rack mountable and may be exposed to high heat and high humidity conditions; 10)BIT Testing-It is desired that the recorder be capable of built-in testing for vendor engineered components.
This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request For Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a resultant contract.  This request is for information only and is intended to identify items currently available or companies capable of providing the required system.  When responding, please reference sources sought announcement number N00178-10-Q-1909.

Software white-listing technology that allows systems to run only approved applications and prevents execution of all other software on the system.


2. Technical Requirement Two:
Content Aware Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Background:
This Data Loss Prevention (DLP) initiative is one component of an overall Department of State security and privacy strategy.

DLP will support an in-depth of monitoring of user-generated information not currently performed by the Department. Currently, the Departments Sensitive but Unclassified Network (OpenNet) uses a notification (warning banner) that provides necessary and sufficient notice to users of the monitoring of their activity against all IT resources and networks. 

Federal workplace privacy law uniformly permits unlimited monitoring of employee use of IT resources. It is unlikely that employees now expect actual word-by-word inspection of content of emails and files to detect the presence of sensitive data such as social security numbers (SSNs), credit card numbers, and other PII. DLP will (1) reduce the risk of exposure of information sent by unsecured e-mail outside of OpenNet; (2) monitor the writing of sensitive files to removable media located on the desktop; and (3) detect sensitive information on servers that may no longer serve a business purpose. 

The objective of this section of the RFI is to identify specifications for a DLP capability that will support the Department in meeting the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Federal Information and Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements listed below.

NIST
Draft-SP800-122.pdf;
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html

FISMA 
http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf

OMB 06-16:

Issued in June of 2006, this memorandum encouraged the completion of a checklist for the protection of remote information, and provided additional recommendations for protecting PII being stored or transported offsite and accessed remotely. OMB also recommended that all departments and agencies implement protections for remote access to PII by:

 Encrypting all PII (if remote storage is permitted) or removing all PII (if it is not)
 Tracking the download of database extracts to laptops and removable media that contain PII 
 The removal of this data 90 days after it is no longer needed.

These recommendations became mandatory with the subsequent release of M-07-16.

http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/memoranda/fy2006/m06-16.pdf

OMB M-06-19:
Issued in July of 2006, updates a Federal Information and Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 requirement that agencies report security incidents to a Federal Incident Response Center (US CERT) located within the Department of Homeland Security.

http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/memoranda/fy2006/m06-19.pdf

OMB M-07-16:
Issued in May of 2007, makes mandatory the guidelines that were initially outlined in M-06-16 regarding the use of encryption and other security controls. The memorandum also introduces new privacy requirements, calling for agencies to review and reduce the volume of personally identifiable information, in particular the collection and use of social security numbers. In addition, this memorandum modifies certain aspects of the data loss reporting requirements outlined in M-06-19, and requires agencies to develop and implement a breach notification policy within 120 days.

http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf

2.2 Data Loss Prevention Software Requirements:  

Performance
The Department of State has 70,000 global users.  
Performance / Scalability.  List five Data Loss Prevention reference customers with more than 50,000 DLP users.
Full DLP Scalability.  Indicate at least two of the 50,000 user DLP references that are using Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP.  (Sometimes referred to as Large Data Store Discovery; DLP is also referred to as Datacenter or Storage DLP.)

Overall Viability
DLP Market Share.  As part of overall risk mitigation, the Department of State evaluates vendors partially based upon previous success, including market share.  What is your DLP market share as designated by a major industry analyst (i.e. Gartner, Forrester, IDC, Burton Group)?

Government Certifications
FIPS 140-2.  How does your DLP solution meet U.S. Federal Government FIPS 140-2 encryption requirements across all databases and system-to-system communication?
OMB M-06-16/M-07-16.  Database Extracts.  The Department of State has 75 systems listed under the Privacy Act with sensitive information.  How does your solution meet OMB M-06-16 and M-07-16 requirements for finding and protecting sensitive database extracts from all Privacy Act systems?  

Integrated Management
The Department of State seeks a unified DLP system to minimize IT and operational system management and operational costs.  The following questions apply to a full Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discover DLP configuration.
Policy Console.  It is the Department of States requirement that all DLP privacy and security policy definitions across Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP are defined in one console.  
Reporting Console.  It is the Department of States requirement that all DLP privacy and security reporting across Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP be managed from one console.  

Integration with Department of State Infrastructure
Database.  Most enterprise Department of State systems with a database use an Oracle database. 
How many databases are required or incorporated within your system for a customer using Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP?
Are there any non-Oracle databases in your DLP solution?  
If there are any non-Oracle databases, how many and what type? Are all databases provided by DLP vendor?  Is all database support provided by the DLP vendor support?
iPost.  The Department of State is using its own systemiPost--for integrated SCAP and IT system reporting.  How can your DLP system provide reporting information to iPost?
LDAP.  The Department of State seeks to minimize IT integrations.  Does your system require one or two LDAP integrations for full integration across, Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP?
Web Proxies.  The Department of State uses BlueCoat web proxies.  Is your solution a BlueCoat certified solution for Network DLP message blocking?
Remedy.  The Department of State uses Remedy for IT help desk ticket management.  Does your solution have out-of-the box integration with Remedy to generate IT tickets based upon any DLP policy violating incident?  

Integration with Department of State Operations
Federated Model.  The Department of State has multiple bureaus and offices, such as Consular Affairs, Administration, Resource Management, Diplomatic Security, etc.  Explain how your DLP solution provides a federated role based security control with limits for incident access for a role by policy, by department bureau, by country or geography, by severity or remediation status, or by any user-defined custom attribute?  For example, would/could only within Foreign Service Officers be provided access to see DLP incidents attributed to Foreign Service personnel?
Privacy Control.  As per Department of State privacy policy and experience, contractors and other individuals are not to be given access to other DoS employees privacy data.  Explain how your DLP solutions provides privacy control with redaction of certain DLP incident data (such as sender email address, username, and sensitive incident content) from specific users such as contractors who may be first-level incident responders/analysts?
Severity and Escalations.  As per Department of State experience, some DLP incidents may be of higher severity than others due to content (such as classified data, VIP PII data) or amount of data in an incident (hundreds or thousands of records as opposed to a handful of records.)  
Severity Levels.  Does your DLP system provide different incident severity levels?  
Automatic Escalation.  Does your DLP system support automatic initiation of different notifications and remediation tasks based upon varying DLP incident severity level?  
Notifications.  The Department of State is required to automatically notify US-CERT and DS-CIRT for certain Network, Endpoint, or Large Data Store Discovery DLP incidents as per OMB M-06-19.  The questions below apply to Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP incidents, i.e. an employee writes policy violating data to a CD/DVD or emails policy violating data to ones personal email account.
US-CERT & State-CERT.  Does your DLP system support simultaneous notification of US-CERT and DS-CIRT for a particular type of DLP incident?
Simultaneous Notifications.  Does your DLP system support simultaneous notification of US-CERT, DS-CIRT, the Department of State Privacy Office, the employees manager, and system owner for a particular type of DLP incident?  

DLP Product / Service
Remediation.  The Department of State plans to incorporate automatic remediation of DLP incidents.
Network DLP Remediation.  The Department of State requires Network DLP component to automatically remediate network policy violations via blocking, forwarding to third- party encryption gateways, etc.  
Large Data Discovery DLP Remediation.  What automatic remediation actions (quarantine, encryption, etc.) does your solution provide for policy violating files found in Large Data Store Discover DLP?  Does your Large Data Store Discovery DLP remediation solution support more one certified encryption vendor today?  
Endpoint DLP.  The Department of State has over 60,000 endpoint laptops or desktops.   The DLP requirements below are for its Endpoint DLP use.
Content Aware.  The Department of State requires that Endpoint DLP detection be based solely based upon real-time file content data analysis, and not based upon previous tags or human tagging definitions.  
Audit & Control.  The Department of State requires the Endpoint DLP component to provide logging/audit as well as blocking capabilities for policy violating USB copies, CD/DVD copies, HTTP (such as webmail) transactions, IM, and FTP transactions.  
Pop-Up Notifications.  To reduce calls to helpdesk and other operations, the Department of State requires the Endpoint DLP component to provide pop-up information notifications for policy violating actions when in logging/audit mode and pop-up notifications for blocking actions.  
Endpoint Agent.  Does your DLP solution use more than one DLP agent for Endpoint Data Discovery, Audit, and Control? 
Endpoint Agent Deployment.  Does your solution support the use of SMS/SCCM to install agents?

Employee / User Notification.  The Department of State requires a Network DLP component to automatically notify employees of policy violating actions.  
Large Data Discovery DLP.  The Department of State has hundreds of terabytes of stored data and requires the DLP system to identify stored sensitive data as per the requirements below.
Identify Dormant Data.  The Department of State requires that Large Data Discovery DLP find sensitive stored data in forgotten files and systems on file servers.  Does your Large Data Discovery DLP natively mount each file server to scan for sensitive data?  Provide detail.  Additionally, does your Large Data Store Discovery DLP modify any of the file access or file modified dates?
File Information.  The Department of State plans to prioritize findings from Large Data Discovery DLP based upon such items as file Access Control Lists (ACL).  Does your solution display full Microsoft ACLs for policy violating files?
Enterprise Management.  So as not to impact Department of State network usage and operations, scheduling of Large Data Discovery scans is imperative.  Does your solution have the ability to schedule (including automatic pausing of scans) so that all scanning is during non-production hours?  
Undocumented Systems.  The Department of State is very concerned with undocumented systems with large amounts of sensitive data.  Does your solution scan Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM db2 databases for sensitive data?  

2.3 Additional Requirements for DLP:
Provide the required hardware pieces needed for the Data Loss Prevention Software in the capabilities statement.

<SUBJECT>Global Hawk Radar Quick-Look Study
<SOLNBR>10-RFI-ASC
<RESPDATE>050310
<CONTACT>Capt David Jones, Email David.Jones@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center, 659th Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS) has been tasked with conducting a quick-look study for airborne air-to-ground radar systems for the RQ-4 Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) by 1 Jun 10. The 659 AESS seeks white-papers from industry to support the study by 3 May 2010.
<p><br />The Air Force has been working on the new radar system for 8 years where the primary improvements are in resolution and an ability to collect ground moving target indicator (GMTI) imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images simultaneously. The radar system currently under development and flight testing will significantly improve the Air Force's ability to track slow-moving ground vehicles and low-flying cruise missiles. Prior to committing to a full- scale production, the Air Force is doing due diligence to ensure new technologies or techniques have not been developed that could significantly reduce the cost or improve system trade space.</p>
<p>This effort looks across industry, academia, and service/government programs for candidate programs/technology efforts with projected capabilities to be on-par with the new RQ-4 radar system. Candidate solutions may need to project modifications or upgrades, forecast improvements (i.e., expand the size of the radar antenna, increase power, etc.) or apply a new technology process in order to meet operational goals. We are not looking to duplicate our existing program - but are rather looking for evolutionary or revolutionary technologies or approaches that could meet/exceed performance and lower cost. We are also interested in understanding possible technologies that could support the next generation of SAR/GMTI systems.</p>
<p>The new RQ-4 radar system will provide near real-time, all weather, and day/night high resolution SAR imagery and MTI across the full spectrum of operations: Major Combat Operations including Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack; Military Support to Stabilization, Security, Transition and Reconstruction Operations; Homeland Security; Deterrence Operations; or other ad hoc national surveillance and reconnaissance requirements. Because this is a quick-look study, the 659th will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> host an industry day but will provide additional background data up request. The operational requirements for the new radar systems are sensitive and classified. Copies of operational requirements, potential concepts of operation, plus additional background capabilities of the radar can be obtained by contacting the study lead, Capt David Jones.&nbsp;Classified background data will be provided only to those with verified clearances.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following ground rules/assumptions apply:</p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 6pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Milstar is a joint service satellite communications system that provides secure, jam resistant, worldwide communications to meet essential wartime requirements for high priority military users. The multi-satellite constellation links command authorities with a wide variety of resources, including ships, submarines, aircraft and ground stations, providing interoperable encrypted voice, data, teletype or facsimile communications among the users of Army, Navy, and Air Force Milstar terminals. These links are used for a multitude of operations, from calling in Theater Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and air strikes from forward deployed fire teams, to national command and control messaging, through missile defense and Presidential communications links. Continued operation of these requirements <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>is critical to national security and vital to our national economic interests. Immediate execution of these requirements is therefore crucial - any delay or degradation of service would immediately and directly result in serious loss of military capabilities, assets, intelligence and personnel, and recovery time for tactical and strategic nets would suffer extended outages. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Contractor support must demonstrate a thorough understanding of Milstar systems, and the missions of both 4 SOPS and the 614 SCS. The majority of contractor resources will be employed within a Restricted Area at both the Secret and Top Secret/SCI levels. The contractor must have on staff, or have the ability to hire and retain, personnel to perform the work with the required clearances. The core support personnel will be required to work with day-staff on-site primarily at Schriever AFB, Colorado.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice and not a request for quotations. The purpose of this announcement is to seek qualified contractors with the capability to provide an Electronic Health Record System.
<p><br />Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>Safety &amp; Occupational Health is conducting market research for a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Electronic Health Record System in order to streamline our work processes, recordkeeping, and assist the Health Unit staff in daily work operations. Our staff consists of two (2) Health Units, three (3) nurses, and two (2) office assistants. Our Health Units serve approximately 2,000 employees total. The system needs to be "occupational health" based, and must be able to be used in an occupational health unit setting (i.e., we don't need a large scale system like a doctor's office or hospital may have). Our needs include accurate recordkeeping for medical documentation, wellness programs, storage of medical documentation, and research capabilities.</p>
<p>The system must be able to "build-in" some of the current forms we use such as the following: emergency medical information, physical exam information, nurses notes, progress notes, pre-employment physicals, vision and hearing information, pulmonary information, vaccine releases, and urine and glucose information. The system must be able to be tailored to meet all Safety &amp; Occupational Health's needs.</p>
<p>The system must be Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant.</p>
<p>The system must be Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 140-2 compliant.</p>
<p>RFI Specifics</p>
<p>An adequate response to this RFI would include the following items:</p>
<p>&bull; A proposed product to provide the capabilities described above; and<br />&bull; A general cost associated with the product or service.</p>
<p>Additionally please provide the name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.) based on NAICS Code 519190, size standard $7.0m. Contact information shall include the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.</p>

<DESC>The VA Network 22 Logistic Office intends to enter into sole source procurement with Applied Biosystems Div.  This proposed contract action is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, incorporates provisions and clauses as those in effect. This procurement is for a kit that isolates leukocytes from whole blood using a filter-based technology, store the captured leukocytes for several days at room temperature (or longer at lower temperatures), then isolate the leukocyte RNA. The resulting RNA is depleted of globin mRNA due to the absence of red blood cells, thereby improving sample utility for expression profiling and other applications.  This kit contains only the materials and reagents for WBC fractionation and leukocyte stabilization. Stabilized leukocytes can then be stored or shipped to another location. RNA isolation requires purchase of the LeukoLOCK Total RNA Isolation Kit. These kits (modules of the Total RNA Isolation System) are offered separately to accommodate blood sample collection at one location and sample processing at a different location.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely by the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Inquires will only be accepted by email at rosetta.quintons@va.gov .

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE - SOLE SOURCE under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as promulgated by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The U.S. General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Rocky Mountain Region (R8) intends to procure, from its incumbent contractor, by negotiation (contract modification) on a non-competitive basis, Database Management System and Services, to include the migration and management of a Database Management System (DBMS) from a contractor owned and operated Information Technology System (ITS) to a Government owned and operated ITS network. This Notice of Intent is neither a pre-solicitation announcement, request for proposals, nor request for quotes; nor does it obligate the Government to award a contract. Requests for a solicitation package will not receive a response; however, see "Notice to Interested Vendors" below.<br /><br />Background and Purpose:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) The General Services Administration (GSA) is the owner of a Federal Government property known as the Denver Federal Center (DFC), located within the public health and environmental jurisdiction of Colorado Department of Public Health &amp; Environment (CDPHE) - Hazardous Materials &amp; Waste Management Division.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) GSA, as DFC's property owner, has been found to have potential public health and/or environmental hazards that may be in violation of certain Colorado public health statutes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Pursuant to the authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Section 25-15-308(2), C.R.S. of the Colorado Hazardous Waste Act , the GSA Administrator and the CDPHE have entered into a Compliance Order on Consent (Order on Consent) - a settlement agreement or express terms, mutually agreed upon in writing, between GSA and CDPHE for GSA's voluntary efforts to assess and remediate hazardous contaminants found in the soil and groundwater on the DFC proper in addition to any contaminants found to have originated on the DFC and currently have migrated beyond the present boundaries of DFC.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) A records management and archive system have been determined to be necessary for loading, storing, evaluating, and reporting environmental data collected as part of GSA's compliance with the terms of the Order on Consent.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) GSA, in collaboration with CDPHE, has entered into a contract with URS Corporation (URS) to develop a DBMS to capture, evaluate, analyze, and archive data collected in GSA's activities in its compliance with the terms of the Order on Consent.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) By contract (Federal Supply Schedule - Multiple Award Schedule Delivery Order) with URS, the DBMS hardware, software, programs, and applications are currently housed and hosted on URS' owned and controlled ITS network.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) Part of the computer software for the DBMS is the intellectual and proprietary property of URS, modified in part to accommodate GSA's Order on Consent data storage and retrieval needs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) GSA's Chief Communications and Chief Information Officer (CCIO) has directed that information systems and programs related to GSA programs be stored and managed on ITS owned and operated by GSA personnel. GSA's current ITS operating environment consists of the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A virtual environment based on VMware&reg; technology.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Standard&reg; on a Windows 2003 Standard Edition Server&reg; with appropriate memory and disk space.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Software Technologies LTD, Check Point&reg; VPN-1 Secure Client R60 HFA02 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Microsoft&reg; Remote Desktop Connection&reg; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Citrix&reg; MetaFrame Server&reg; application server<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. All remote access shall be through the GSA VPN, which requires Department of Homeland Security HSPD-12 (Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12) clearance.<br /><br />Proposed Contract Action:<br /><br />This Notice of Intent to negotiate a non-competitive contract modification is to provide public notice of GSA's need for uninterrupted database management services by transferring an existing DBMS from a contractor owned and controlled ITS to GSA's owned and controlled ITS. The proposed negotiations will include the costs of all plant, labor, materials and equipment deemed necessary to transfer the DBMS from URS' owned ITS to GSA's ITS. Further, the negotiations will entail (1) modifying the existing contract to include a base period (the remainder of the current contract performance period) plus option years (a maximum of four (4) years); (2) the acquisition of certain rights in data and computer software; (3) database administration support services; and (4) contract transition services, to include training and assistance, to a successor contractor, to ensure uninterrupted continuity of service to GSA in DBMS services support in the event of a competitive contracting opportunity determination. As currently hosted on a contractor-owned and controlled ITS network, GSA's current annual estimated contract expenditure is between $50,000.00 to $70,000.00. <br /><br />GSA's Contract Requirements:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Deliver computer application software for the installation of the DBMS onto GSA's ITS to insure continuity of service on the date of contract award. At a minimum, the application software and client access must be able to operate within the GSA ITS operating environment with the following features:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A Microsoft SQL Server 2008-based DBMS and database, with the same functionalities as the contract DBMS/database. This DBMS shall be accessible through remote connection (i.e.,&nbsp;Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection&nbsp;and Citrix MetaFrame Server). A desktop version of the DBMS shall be provided for accessing the database through Virtual Private Network (VPN).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A Microsoft Access-based desktop version of the DBMS equivalent to the existing Microsoft SQL Server 2008-based DBMS/database, with the same functionalities, and using for data uploads the current Access database format.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. A document management database (DMDB) for storage and retrieval of laboratory reports (in PDF), laboratory electronic data deliverables (EDD), and contractor uploads. This database shall have a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to retrieve these files or open them in a new window.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Insure the DBMS maintains its current form, fit, and functionality. If the database is modified from the existing database, the new database structure must conform to the existing structure and all tables within the database. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Provide a Database Administrator; a Key Personnel position.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Manage, maintain, administer, update, and coordinate the hosting of the DBMS and associated database(s). This includes coordinating with and assisting GSA with migrating the DBMS and database to the GSA ITS.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Provide business-hours technical support. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) Provide DBMS training.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) Adhere to all GSA IT standards, policies and procedures, in addition to the Department of Homeland Security guidance and procedures for IT security.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) Provide all property, equipment, materials, resources, and developmental tools for DBMS enhancements.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9) Provide licenses and/or appropriate access to the DBMS to GSA's authorized users (e.g., GSA personnel, CDPHE personnel, GSA's third-party contractors, and GSA's prospective contractors.)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10) Update, as needed, GSA Quality Assurance Plan Standard Operating Procedure for Data Management 15 (SOP 15).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11) Provide all documentation required for use and/or understanding of the DBMS and the database (e.g., associated tables and/or peripheral software). This shall include data and logic flow charts of how and where the sources of the data originates, how the data flows through the various modules of the DBMS program, any controls, and how it is output.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12) Upgrade the existing remote desktop version of the DBMS/database to include all functionalities not currently available to the end user. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13) Provide a fully functional DBMS/database to be accessed, via VPN, through GSA's Citrix&reg; MetaFrame Server&reg; application portal and through Microsoft&reg; Remote Desktop Connection&reg;.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14) Upgrade the Remote Desktop Connection&reg; and Citrix&reg; MetaFrame Server&reg; DBMS to prevent simultaneous users access.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15) Correct and/or modify historical data to conform to field constraints in the DBMS tables and modules. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16) The contractor should possess a working knowledge and understanding of the relationship of RCRA and associated ARARs (Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements) to the data evaluated by GSA, CDPHE, and GSA RFI (RCRA Facility Investigation) contractors through the DBMS.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source cost plus fixed fee type Research and Development contract to Infoscitex Corporation as a follow-on to contract W912HQ-07-P-0026.  The description of the requirement is as follows:<BR><BR>Polymeric composite materials are used extensively throughout the military.  Their lightweight, high strength and low corrosion properties make them the materials of choice for aircraft, electronics, structures, personnel protective armors, and components on weapon, vessel, and vehicle systems.  The Army, Navy and Air Force have concluded that composites are a critical technology in meeting many weapon systems performance requirements.  This is also true for Army helicopters, Navy ships and tactical, and amphibious vehicles.  <BR><BR>The composite systems used most widely in military systems are graphite, glass and aramid fibers in a thermosetting resin.  What distinguishes military composites from commercial composites is the requirement for high performance composite parts that have a battle-hardened design to withstand high loadings, heavy impacts, environmental extremes and service temperatures ranging from -60F to 250F (up to 500F for aircraft exhaust, etc.). <BR><BR>Many of these composite materials are repaired using conventional repair techniques, including autoclave repair using repair resins, and field repair using reinforced resins such as Bond-OTM.  Current repair procedures require the purchase of large amounts of hazardous materials, much of which have limited shelf lives.  Many military users anticipate that new technologies can replace hand layup operations and patch/autoclave repairs and have the potential to be economically and technically viable, with focused and successful development and demonstration efforts.<BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) legacy systems including aircraft, helicopter rotor blades, and ground vehicles, all have extensive composite materials and pose environmental concerns that have been under investigation by DoD and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a number of years.  <BR><BR>Air Force, Army, Navy, and DOE have technology development programs to explore new composites processing methods, including advanced fiber placement, resin transfer molding, reaction injection molding, and electron beam (e-beam) curing for cleaner composites manufacturing.  <BR><BR>The objective of this the proposed work is to develop environmentally benign repair processes for the composites used in military applications that eliminate or significantly reduce the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and hazardous waste generated by the current repair processes.  Possible areas to be addressed include but are not limited to: the development of repair resins, repair adhesives with longer shelf lives, and alternative repair techniques.  Proposed solutions must be able to meet or exceed current performance requirements for composite repairs and offer significantly reduced environmental impact.<BR><BR><BR>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a cost plus fixed fee contract to Infoscitex Corporation.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">DODEA-ONTARIO STANDARDS ALIGNMENT</p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br /><br />1.1. The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 85,000 students in seven states, twelve foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The number of students varies based on the deployment of military troops worldwide. DoDEA's curriculum, resources, and student achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools. <br />1.2 DoDEA is divided into three administrative areas. DDESS (Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools) covers the schools in seven states and Puerto Rico, and for administrative purposes, Cuba. DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependent Schools) is divided into DoDDS-Europe and DoDDS-Pacific. The former administers the schools in England, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and Bahrain. The latter covers the schools in Korea, Japan, and for administrative purposes, Guam. <br /><br />2.0 BACKGROUND<br /><br />2.1 Military students matriculate between Ontario, Canada and DoDEA schools. However, the content standards of these two school systems are not easy to align for counselors and teachers. <br /><br />2.2 The Ontario content standards may be found at the following two URLs: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/subjects.html</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/secondary/grades.html</span>. The DoDEA curriculum content standards may be found at the following URL: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.dodea.edu/curriculum/</span>. <br /><br />3.0 SCOPE<br /><br />3.1 DoDEA requires a crosswalk or alignment of standards between the Ontario (Canada) and DoDEA content standards for grades 6-12 mathematics, social studies, science, and English language arts. This alignment will allow users to identify the knowledge and skills that both systems are expected their students to master at each grade. For students entering DoDEA schools from Ontario schools or transferring to Ontario schools, it will allow administrators from either school system to determine their placement.<br /><br />4.0 REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />4.1 The Contractor shall perform an alignment study, providing a crosswalk that shows the depth and breadth of content coverage between the Ontario (Canada) and DoDEA content standards for grades 6-12 mathematics, social studies, science, and English language arts. <br /><br />4.2 The methodology shall include the cognitive expectations set out by the standards, that is, the degree to which the level of expected knowledge and skills is consistent across DoDEA and Ontario standards. <br /><br />4.3 The alignment study and report shall provide information on the alignment between the DoDEA and Ontario standards which includes (1) content significance/relevance of each standard, (2) cognitive expectation level of each standard, and (3) specificity and clarity of each standard.<br /><br />4.4 The final report shall consist of an executive summary and a matrix. The executive summary shall include a description of the methodology including definitions of the terms, the findings of the study with conclusions, and a summary of the alignment study results including recommendations. The matrix shall be a user-friendly crosswalk for school administrators and guidance counselors, which summarizes the findings.<br /><br />4.5 Option Year: If exercised, the requirement would be the same as the base year's except that grades 4 and 5 would be aligned. There would only be one option year.<br /><br />5.0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />5.1 Not applicable.<br /><br />6.0 DELIVERABLES<br /><br />6.1 Post-Award Conference: The Contractor shall participate in a teleconference or videoconference to discuss the requirements in greater detail.<br /><br />6.2 Draft Report: The Contractor shall provide a draft of the DoDEA-Ontario Standards Alignment in an electronic document that can be reviewed and revised. <br /><br />6.2.1 Final Report: Written feedback from DoDEA shall be incorporated into the final report, which shall consist of an electronic document.<br /><br />7.0 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND TIMELINE<br /><br />7.1 The Contractor shall provide all services to be performed and all items to be delivered in accordance with the following delivery schedule:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deliverable</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ref</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delivery Date</span><br /><br />BASE YEAR:<br /><br />Post-Award Conference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLT five days after award<br />Draft Report&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NLT 60 days after post-award videoconference<br />Final Report&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLT 10 days after receipt of written feedback from DoDEA<br /><br />OPTION YEAR ONE:<br /><br />Conference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be determined<br />Draft Report&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLT 60 days after conference<br />Final Report&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLT 10 days after receipt of written feedback from DoDEA<br /><br />8.0 DATA RIGHTS<br /><br />8.1 All alignment study information/materials produced or data obtained under this contract will belong solely to DoDEA and shall not be used or produced by any other party, without prior written permission from the DoDEA.</p>

Failure to comply with these requirements may result in termination of vehicle access privileges. <br />(ii) Contractors filling water trucks on the installation are only authorized to fill trucks from the non-potable hydrant outside Bldg 8034 and non-potable reservoir #3. The approved potable location is from the hydrant south of Bldg 8124, Snow Barn. Exceptions to these locations can be approved by 10 CES after coordination with 10 SFS. Any location where contractors are filling water trucks will have a back-flow preventor installed.<br />(4) Added: Security Requirements. The contractor shall adhere to the installation security requirements as provided for in AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management, USAFA supplement Chapter 2,Para 2.3 and 2.4; Chapter 7, Para 7.3; and Chapter 8) AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards (Paragraphs 2.22, Atch 3), DoDI 2000.16, Department of Defense Antiterrorism Standards, Paragraphs E3.18 and E3.25). <br />(i) Antiterrorism (AT). During increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs), entry requirements to the installation may change with little to no notice. During FPCON Charlie, contractors without a "C" on their CAB may be denied access. Depending on the incident or threat, all personnel to include contractors may be denied access to the installation for safety/security reasons.<br />(I) Contractors are subject to spot checks or inspections of their vehicles and personal items at entry control points or facility access points during higher threats or during random antiterrorism measure checks. Failure to comply with these added security measures may result in denial of access to the installation.<br />(II) Contractors are encouraged to receive Antiterrorism Awareness Training annually available at no cost, but it is not required in CONUS. Installation, Mission Element or the Unit Antiterrorism Representative (ATR) can provide this training when requested. Contractors can play an important role in protecting the installation and are encouraged to report suspicious activity to Security Forces by either calling 911 during emergencies or 333-2000.<br />(ii) Operations Security (OPSEC): As applicable based on the scope and nature of the contract, the contractor shall comply with Government OPSEC guidance and training as prescribed in AFI 10-701, Operations Security, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1 and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act, for handling of For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and HQ 10 ABW/CC Memorandum, USAFA Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy. Government provided OPSEC training is offered at no charge to the contractor. The contractor shall notify the applicable Unit OPSEC representative of the using activity receiving the contracted support, within one business day upon the discovery of any OPSEC violations<br />(iii) Communications Security (COMSEC): The contractor shall comply with Government COMSEC requirements as contained in AFI 33-201V2, Communications Security, user requirements and USAFA COMSEC Manager guidance/directives. <br />(5) Added: Prior to contractor employees providing services on the installation under this contract, the contractor shall validate that all contractor employees performing services on the installation are United States citizen or hold a valid resident alien status providing proof of alien registration with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service.<br />(i) Background Checks. Prior to contractor personnel working on USAFA installation properties, the contractor shall agree that USAFA Security Forces may conduct a criminal history check, as applicable, on any or all employees performing on this contract. Criminal history checks may include accessing the appropriate state crime information center and national crime information center database to include, but not limited to, any state listed by the employee as current and past addresses. If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract. The letter shall contain the names(s) of the individuals(s) with their social security numbers. The CO will endorse the letter and forward it to PRC. The contractors shall collect CABs and return them to the PRC within 5 days.<br />(3) Added: At the end of each performance period (i.e. options) and at the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall submit a letter to the CO containing the number of badges issued on each contract, the names of the individuals with their social security numbers, and identify those badges being returned. The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is issued as Request for Quotes (RFQ) # 246-09-Q-0037 and is unrestricted. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34, effective July 1, 2009. The associated NAICS code is 512110, with a standard business size of $25.0M. <br />Contractor shall provide a firm, fixed-price (all inclusive to include travel and per diem) for requirements described below. The Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm, fixed-priced contract. <br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:
<p>Educational Video for Consumers on<br />the Maintenance of Water Wells and Septic Tank Facilities</p>
<p><br />I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Division of Sanitation Facilities Construction (DSFC) of the Indian Health Service (HIS) provides for construction of water, wastewater and solid waste facilities for Indian people and tribes within the authority of Public Law 86-121. The purpose for the work the DSFC accomplishes is to raise the health level of Native Americans within the field office service area by improving the sanitary facilities.</p>
<p>To this end, once facilities are installed, it is necessary to educate the water well or septic tank owners on the proper care and maintenance of their new facilities. Reading levels differ from household to household and therefore, written communication may not be the best method to convey important instructions. Because the training is visual in nature, it is optimal to "show and tell" the owners by using a video approach for those who have DVD players. Written instructions will still be available in the case an owner does not have access to a DVD player.</p>
<p>The DVD would be given to the owners after the construction of water and/or sewer facilities are installed.</p>
<p>The contractor will - under the counsel of the subject matter experts from DSFC - develop a script, define the visuals that will be needed, determine the locations for shooting video, schedule and coordinate the on-location video shooting sessions, shoot the video and accompanying audio (with equipment the contractor provides), edit the video, and provide a finalized digital DVD master. Duplications of the DVD (copies) will be priced separately. The contractor will also provide a master survey card to be included with video, which can provide an evaluation mechanism for homeowners to provide feedback.</p>
<p>The performance time is six (6) months from the date the contract is issued.</p>
<p>The Government shall have full rights to copying the DVD as it deems necessary.</p>
<p><br />II. REQUIREMENTS <br />A. Develop an easy-to-understand comprehensive training video that addresses the care and maintenance of water and sewer systems installed by the IHS for homeowners. <br />B. Use existing program information and information gained from discussion with pertinent DSFC subject matter experts, along with interviews from various previous clients to develop a video script that tells the story of how to care for and maintain a water well or septic tank system installed by DSFC.<br />C. Determine from DSFC subject matter experts any cultural or environmental sensitivities to be considered while working with Native Americans or wildlife while shooting on location. <br />D. Accompany a construction crew at a site prior to videotaping to understand the systems, the installation process and the logistical and physical surrounding limitations for a future shooting.<br />E. Write a script that conveys the information necessary to provide easy-to-understand directions on the care and maintenance of water wells and septic systems.<br />F. Work with DFSC employees to identify key homeowners who would allow shooting on location and possible on-camera interviews.<br />G. Work with DFSC as appropriate to schedule and coordinate all on-location shooting.<br />H. Develop a 30-minute video that includes two (2) segments that are 15 minutes each. One segment will focus on water wells; the other will focus on septic tank systems. The DVD will have "chapters" so viewers can either watch the video in its entirety or skip forward to the portion they simply want to review again. This functionality will encourage more frequent viewing and reference - and will ultimately promote better care and upkeep of DSFC installed facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III. WORK ASSIGNMENT AND DIRECTION<br />A. The producer-contractor will manage the day-to-day work and communicate regularly with the IHS project leader. The contractor producer has responsibility for arranging, scheduling and monitoring the work. Technical guidance will be provided by the IHS project leader.</p>
<p>B. The Contract will ensure that the project activities are completed in accordance with the following regulations and guidance:<br />1. IHS policies, procedures and guidance, including among others, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Criteria for the Sanitation Facilities Construction Program, OSHA (as applicable), all ethical practices according to the Public Relations Society of America, Better Business Bureau and Tulsa Chamber of Commerce.<br />2. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services must be identified as the producer. Include the HHS and Indian Health logos at the end of the video. The HHS logo must be larger that the agency / program logo.<br />3. Video must meet HHS Web standards and be 508 compliant, including captioning. For additional information, visit http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/index.html .</p>

Solicitation Number:  AG-0436-S-10-006
Posted Date: April 8, 2010
Response Date:  April 16, 2010
Set Aside: Total Small Business

Contracting Office:

USDA/NRCS Oregon State Office
1201 NE Lloyd Blvd Suite 900
Portland, OR 97232

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the   FAR Subpart 12.6 and FAR 5.203 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation number AG-0436-S-10-006 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

USDA/NRCS Oregon intends to award a firm fixed price contract with 1 option year and will utilize procedures under FAR part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. 

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36.  The clauses and provisions referenced in this solicitation can be found in full text format at http://www.arnet.gov/far and http://www.da.usda.gov/procurement/policy/agar_x/agar04.pdf

This acquisition is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325998.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.

Description:

This purchase will have a guaranteed minimum of 2,000 gallons with a maximum of 3,000 gallons in up to three deliveries per year.  On the first order NRCS will want 200 gallons of solution delivered in 5 gallon square pails (40 each), provided by vendor. 
 NRCS Oregon owns 2  ea 275 Gallon totes and about 10 ea 55 Gallon Drums, which will be empty and need to be picked up at our warehouse, 463 Perimeter Way, Door 7, Troutdale, OR 97060 (This warehouse also has an alternative address of 202 NW Graham Rd.), filled with the solution and returned.   

The successful bidder may choose to deliver the product in new or used containers (totes, drums or pails) without picking the empty containers up at our warehouse beforehand, but the containers that USDA/NRCS currently owns will be accepted in trade for the new containers, and the vendor will be responsible for removing the old containers from our warehouse.  Any purchase of additional totes, drums or pails (except for the 40 pails mentioned above) must be pre-approved by the contracting officer and be billed separately, since payment will not be handled under this contract.  Because the warehouse is unmanned, prior coordination will need to be made before each pickup and/or delivery to ensure there are employees on site.  Prior notice of 48 hours is required for each pickup and/or delivery.  The quote for the contract year will include the cost of the above listed solution, the pickup/delivery charges, and the 40 each 5 gallon pails mentioned above, and will be priced per gallon.  The quote for the option year will include the above listed solution, the pickup/delivery charges and will be priced per gallon. Purchases of the product delivered in the rectangular pails may or may not be required in the option year, at NRCS Oregon discretion. Both current year and option year prices must be quoted for quote to be considered.  Current year and option year pricing will be added together to determine the best price (Evaluation of Options Clause, 52.217-5).  The Option Year funding is dependant on funds availability (Availability of Funds Clause, 52.232-18).  The government has the right to exercise the options.  

The principle place of delivery is FOB Destination to the following address:

USDA/NRCS Snow Surveys
463 Perimeter Way, Portland, OR 97060

The first delivery will be scheduled on or around May 5, 2010.

Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint (see "Evaluation" below).<br />(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of a quote, unless the vendor qualifies the quote by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotes may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the vendor specifies otherwise in the quote. (TO BE USED AT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER'S DISCRESTION, RESERVE OTHERWISE)<br />(i) Reserved.<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />Contracting Officer shall insert the significant evaluation factors, such as:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br />(ii) price<br />Basis for award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award.<br />(b) A purchase order, mailed or otherwise furnished to the vendor shall result in a binding contract upon receipt of written acknowlegement by the vendor or commencement of performance.<br />________________________________________________________________________<br />NOTE: In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided:<br />Legal Effect of Quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing<br />(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY<br />No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED INSURANCE<br />The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract. In accordance with HSAR 3052.217-95, Liability and Insurance (USCG) (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including: <br />1.

<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>

The COR will comment on the contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the contractor, SFLC (APM), the NESU and Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will make the final response to the contractor in writing.<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation.<br />Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:<br />Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)<br />2100 Second Street, SW<br />Washington, D.C. 20593<br />Telephone (202)267-2285<br />FAX: (202)267-4011<br />Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued. It is incumbent upon contractors to monitor the FEDBIZOPS web page for any/all subsequent amendments. FEDBIZOPS also contains an option for automatic notification service. <br />
<p><br />This combined synopsis/solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses it contains are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.

The Assistance to Firefighters Program Office has a requirement for Hotel Accommodations, Conference Space, and Hotel Services for conduct of a panel review of grants submitted in response to the Assistance to Firefighters grant (AFG) panel review process. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services or 3rd Party Event Planning Services. FEMA will not consider a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel or conference center. An offer that requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a 3rd party shall be deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the conference is June&nbsp;12 - 18, 2010. No other dates will be considered.</p>
<p>The location for the conference is Baltimore, Maryland. No other locations will be considered. Hotel/conference center location must be within 30 miles of the Baltimore Washington International Airport (BWI). No other facilities will be considered.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation (HSFEEM-10-Q-0060) and is supplemented with additional information included herein. Offeror shall provide the following:<br />A. Lodging for the panelists and staff <br />B. Transportation to and from the servicing airport<br />C. Conference/ballroom space for the conduct of the panels<br />D.

The contract shall pay for the room and associated taxes. All attendees will be responsible for paying any incidental room charges such as phone, pay per view video, room service, etc. Reservations shall be made with the hotel either by the participants or the AFG support contractor within 7 days of the event. (Completion date: Ongoing throughout contract performance period.)</p>
<p>Task A-2. Contractor shall provide adequate shuttle service to transport attendees between the local servicing airport and the hotel. It may be necessary to enhance any existing shuttle service during the surge of the arrivals on Sunday afternoon and for departures on Friday. (Completion date: Ongoing throughout contract performance period.)</p>
<p>B. Tasks associated with conference space for AFG:</p>
<p>Task B-1. Contractor shall provide one large conference room with approximately 7000 - 8000 square feet of space. The room will accommodate 37 large (6 foot rounds) tables spaced throughout. The intent is to have 37 groups of six people at each table. Eight 5-foot tables will be placed in the room to accommodate eight panel chairs and eight quality control reviewers. Room shall also have a podium with microphone, screen, and computer projection. (Completion date: Ongoing throughout contract performance period.)</p>
<p>Task B-2. Contractor shall provide, adjacent or within close proximity of the large conference space, one large breakout room for eating (approx. 1,200 square feet) and four additional breakout rooms (approx. 400 to 500 square feet) for file storage (approx. 650 square feet), data entry (approx. 500 square feet), technical review (approx. 400 square feet), and command center (approx. 400 square feet). Alternatively, contractor could provide two larger breakout rooms of no less than 1,200 square feet (one for banquet and one for data entry and file storage) and two smaller breakout rooms of approx. 400 to 500 square feet (for tech review and command). Each breakout room will be set up with 5-foot tables and workstations. The banquet breakout room should be equipped with computers (see Task B-6) and internet connectivity so the panelists can check email. All rooms should be within as close a proximity to each other as possible. (Completion date: Ongoing throughout contract performance period.)</p>
<p>Task B-3. All space provided by contractor will be securable 24-hours-a-day with the exception of the dinning space; with access keys provided to government and or contract staff. Offer shall state this clearly. (Completion date: Ongoing throughout contract performance period.)</p>

The government can not put down a credit card for line activation). IT support shall be provided to respond in a timely fashion to any system, equipment, and internet connection failures. Computers should be securable so as to limit access to the participants. (Completion date: Ongoing throughout the contract performance period.)</p>
<p>C. Tasks associated with the meals for AFG:</p>
<p>Since the location of the panels will be unknown until this contract is awarded, we cannot assume that there will be adequate eating facilities to accommodate 250 people within a reasonable distance from the conference facility. Due to the strict scheduling that needs to be adhered to for this event we cannot allow participants to be left to their own means for food procurement. Therefore, it is imperative that meals be provided to the participants in order to guarantee their availability during the core hours of the panel.</p>
<p>Task C-1. The contractor shall provide buffet-style meals (three per day, Monday through Thursday; breakfast and lunch only on Friday) throughout the panel process.</p>
<p>Task C-2. The contractor shall provide healthy, light snacks as well as juice, water, and a variety of sodas for morning and afternoon breaks for the participants. Coffee shall be continuously available during the conference hours each day, Monday-Friday.</p>
<p>Task C-3. The contractor shall provide banquet space for the meals (in addition to the space designated above for breakout rooms) within close proximity of the conference room.</p>
<p><br />Technical and/or administrative questions must be submitted in writing to chance.caione@dhs.gov no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, Wednesday, April 7, 2010. Individual responses will not be given. Responses to all inquiries will be published by amendment to the solicitation on the FedBizOps site.</p>

Award will be made to the Offeror demonstrating that it provides the best value to the Government based on technical and price considerations.<br /><br />Offerors shall complete the Schedule of Services and Prices provided as Attachment 2, and shall submit this schedule with their proposals.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

Technical Approach<br />2. Staffing<br />3. Past Performance<br /><br />These criteria are weighted in descending order of importance.

In detail, the technical criteria are:<br />1. Technical Approach. The purpose of this criterion is to assess the&nbsp;Offeror's approach to the tasks described in the Statement of Work, including technical understanding. <br />2. Staffing. The purpose of this criterion is to evaluate the qualifications of the proposed staffing. The Offeror will identify the Program Manager and a Task Area Expert for each of the five task areas of the SOW as Key Personnel, and the submitted r&eacute;sum&eacute;s will be evaluated to assess (1) the qualifications of the Program Manager, and (2) the qualifications of each proposed Task Area Expert, in terms of experience, qualifications, and education relevant to the SOW. These two subcriteria are of equal importance.<br />3. Past Performance. The purpose of the criterion is to assess the ability of the Offeror to perform successfully based upon an evaluation of its relevant past performance history on work of the type and complexity described in the SOW.<br /><br />Solicitation Provisions:<br />All Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (AUG 2009) must be submitted with the offer.

<DESC><p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE EXTENDED TO 28 APR 10<br />AS OF 7 APR, THREE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED<br /><br />SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE:&nbsp;4 March 2010. The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a cost plus award fee, non-personal services contract under full and open competition for Joint Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Management and Planning System (JSMPS)/Joint Integrated SATCOM Tool (JIST) Support. This is a follow-on contract to FA4600-05-F-0212. Performance will be for a five-year period. This will include a base period and four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>Services required within the scope of this requirement include technical support; hardware and software installation and integration; database and software development; continued development and deployment of existing JSMPS/JIST tools and capabilities; continued updating and employment of key SATCOM management and planning data; data manipulation and presentation; testing, demonstration, and fielding of developed software systems; and requisite hardware and software sustainment and support activities. JSMPS/JIST will be matured into a fully net-centric, web-enabled database and application suite with a hardware, software, and support architecture to meet the needs of DoD SATCOM stakeholders. The resulting tools and capabilities will provide a robust and secure environment for collaborative Electro-magnetic and Radio Frequency Interference (EMI/RFI) detection, tracking, analysis and mitigation. To accomplish this, JSMPS/JIST would expand existing capabilities encompassing assignment and execution data for all remaining DOD SATCOM systems, acquire needed data from existing and programmed SATCOM system management and planning applications and databases, and make this data readily available as an integrated and user-defined operational picture. To support better Intelligence Community (IC) participation in EMI resolution, JSMPS would be deployed on the JWICS network enclave with a cross-domain solution allowing for near-real time data refreshing from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) JSMPS/JIST. JSMPS will connect to existing databases to provide data and products for Telemetry Tracking &amp; Control (TT&amp;C) data for all space systems to effectively support EMI resolution. Finally, JSMPS/JIST shall be available and sustainable while data is appropriately protected and secure.</p>
<p>On-site work may be performed at either of the following Government installations:</p>
<p>USSTRATCOM<br />Building 500<br />Offutt AFB, NE 68113-6600</p>
<p>AFSPC <br />Buildings 1470 &amp; 1471 <br />Peterson AFB, CO 80914-3050</p>
<p>All contractor personnel working any direct tasking on the project shall hold a minimum current SECRET security clearance (an interim SECRET clearance is acceptable for newly assigned personnel whose final clearance is still being completed). To work on-site within USSTRATCOM/J661 or within the GSSC, contractor personnel shall have a minimum TOP SECRET clearance and be eligible for Special Compartmented Information (SCI) indoctrination.</p>
<p>The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government-wide point of entry. No solicitation is available at this time. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizops.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner. All associated documents will be released electronically. The NAICS code is 541512. Anticipated award date is Fall 2010.</p>
<p>Address questions via email to the contract specialist or contracting officer only. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

You will be taken to PIXS site, then scroll down to bottom of page and under current attachment table, open up pdf file. 

INTRODUCTION The Air Force is planning to acquire a Personnel Recovery Recapitalization aircraft to replace the current HH-60G fleet. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent perm! itted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government will determine that their contractor team members have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government may conduct follow-on discussions with responders through individual one-on-one and/or collective "industry day" sessions.
It is anticipated the United States Air Force will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G air vehicles. The first lot is anticipated to be awarded beginning in FY12. To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), 303rd AESW, 669th AESS/SYKA, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing eight (8) aircraft (excluding any RDT&E aircraft) with sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, technical data) to operate those aircraft.  The Air Force requires Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 September 2015.
Meeting IOC at an affordable cost is critical. If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a contract award is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. &#8195;PURPOSE 
The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to engage industry early in the effort, (2) to identify sources that can provide capability if a contract award is made in FY12, and (3) to assist the Air Force in ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap capability. The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. RESPONSE GUIDANCE 
Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that 'publicly-releasable' and 'proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. 
SSS/CRFI responses should include a: 
1. Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB),  8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone) designation for NAICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company). 
2. Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 12:00 Eastern Time 13 April 2010. Responses must be submitted via e-mail with a CD copy by regular mail in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf). 
3. Responses should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Jim Dinwoody, 669th AESS/SYKA, james.dinwoody@wpafb.af.mil, 1895 Fifth Street, Building 46, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7233.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award as a sole source requirement to Keyence Corporation of America.&nbsp; This procurement will include the Keyence VHX-600 Digital Microscope system.&nbsp; This proposed contract action is for a supply for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.&nbsp; Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.&nbsp; This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received by the closing date and time will be considered.&nbsp; A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.&nbsp; Any company who believes that they can provide the required supply should e-mail their company's capability information to the attention of Barbara Wilson no later than 11:00a.m. EST, April 9, 2010 at <a href="mailto:barbara.b.wilson@dhs.gov">barbara.b.wilson@dhs.gov</a>.&nbsp; Only e-mail responses will be accepted.<br /><br />The following sole source justification is provided:<br /><br />The Keyence VHX-600 series Digital Microscope is fully self-contained, weighs 29 lbs complete, and can be carried by 1 person to do on-site microscopic examination and image analysis. The use of vibration proof material provides stable images of highly magnified objects. The magnification range of up to 5000X and superior depth of field of the VHX allows for SEM quality images without the lengthy sample prep and start-up time. The CCD camera can be handheld which allows for imaging in hard-to-see areas without disassembling the target. Illumination equipment is incorporated in the controller and the light emitted from the camera via optical fiber to enable hand-held use at any angle. The unit's portability allows for added support to our field offices and non-destructive testing for some materials. The 15-inch monitor enables multiple users to observe acquired images.
<p>Extremely small features are best resolved using pixel shift/RGB splitting (54 mega pixel mode) technology only provided by Keyence. This provides 2000TV line resolution. Also, the VH-Z500R lens has .82NA with 4.4mm working distance which is optimized for this purpose.</p>
<p>Z20 lens provides 34mm depth of field. Fractures often are highly reflective and Keyence is the only supplier that can provide 3d models while using live halation removal to eliminate glare.</p>
<p>RGB 3 CCD mode is required to optimize color reproducibility because the CCD is mechanically passed in front of three separate color filters. Halogen lamps do not overpower the sample's color which provide more true sample color to the CCD.</p>
<p>The VHX can achieve about 1um Z-axis repeatability at 1000x. This is the only system on the market that can use halation (glare) removal during image acquisition which is required for complex, reflective surfaces.</p>

<SUBJECT>Draft Request for Proposal Ground-based Midcourse Defense Development and Sustainment Contract (GMD DSC)
<SOLNBR>HQ147-10-R-0016
<CONTACT>Timothy J. Cole, Contract Specialist, Phone 256-450-1781, Email Timothy.Cole@mda.mil - Michele Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-450-1427, Email michele.williams@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is pursuing a competitive Development and Sustainment Contract (DSC) for future development; fielding; test; systems engineering, integration and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and refurbishment; training; and operations and sustainment support for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system and associated support facilities.  Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.205(c), this is a pre-solicitation notice MDA is pursuing a competitive strategy for the effort described herein.

This notice advises Industry, MDA plans to release an amendment to the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) end of April 2010 and to release the formal RFP the end of June 2010.  This notice also includes the current GMD DSC acquisition schedule.  Updates to the schedule will be posted to the GMD DSC Acquisition Web site at:  http://www.mda.mil/business/gmd_dsc.html.  Additionally, the Contractor Acquired Property (CAP) and the GMD Asset lists are included in this notice.  Please be advised the information contained in the CAP and Asset lists are considered as-is; availability is on a noninterference basis with ongoing GMD activities.  The Government is continuing to finalize the work scope and Government property transitions and will provide further detail prior to release of the formal RFP.    

The Government intends to award, on a best value basis, a contract based on the quality and content of proposals received.  An offeror should formulate its proposal using, to the greatest extent practicable, any technical data, computer software or computer software documentation (as defined in DFARS 252.227-7013 and DFARS 252.227-7014) generated in the performance of a Government contract.  Therefore, all offerors are given express Government permission to use technical data or computer software or computer software documentation for which the Government has a royalty free, world-wide, nonexclusive, irrevocable unlimited or government purpose license as established and defined in DFARS 252.227-7013 and DFARS 252.227-7014.  Such clauses as those referenced herein can be found in the existing GMD contracts HQ0006-01-C-0001, HQ0147-09-C-0007 and HQ0147-09-C-0008.  Determinations as to the Government's rights for any technical data or computer software generated in the performance of the referenced contracts or any subcontracts should be made in reliance upon contractor or subcontractor records established in accordance with section (g) of DFARS 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014.  Additionally, offerors are directed to the provisions of section (k) of DFARS 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014 for matters concerning existing subcontractors, under the referenced contracts.  For the purposes of any existing DD 254 conditions the term "need to know encompasses participation under this competition. The proposal must encompass and be compliant with stated requirements.  Open teaming between offerors and the incumbent OEMs is encouraged; see FAR 3.301 (Reports of Suspected Antitrust Violations).

Offerors who intend to propose as a DSC prime contractor which has an interest in visiting GMD facilities are requested to email Mr. Tim Cole at GMDD&SCompetition@mda.mil, no later than April 14, 2010.  The request must include the facility name and GMD equipment you have an interest in viewing.  The potential site visits will be limited to five individuals per prime offeror team.  Due to Government resource and time constraints, these site visits will be conducted with all interested prime offeror teams in attendance.  In order to be considered for a site visit, offeror personnel must possess and maintain at least a SECRET security clearance and proposing prime contractor facilities must be cleared at the TOP SECRET level.

Release of the amended DRFP is NOT a commitment by the Government to award a contract and the Government will NOT pay any costs incurred as a result of this release. 

Please be advised that all communications concerning this acquisition including, but not limited to, management/technical issues, pricing issues, administration issues, and proposal issues must be coordinated through the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Michele Williams or the Contract Specialist, Mr. Tim Cole at GMDD&SCompetition@mda.mil.

<AWARDEE>UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS CENTER FOR RESEARCH, INC.  2385 Irving Hill Road	Lawrence,KS 66045
<DESC>University of Kansas, Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) will provideNASA with a unique, custom built and designed cryospheric radar suite which includesthree radars necessary for mapping the bed topography of ice sheets, determining snowthickness on sea ice and monitoring the near surface firn layers on ice sheets. Theseradars are necessary to meet Operation IceBridge science objectives and is the only radarsuite that is adapted to fly on the NASA P-3 (a propeller airplane) and DC-8 (a jetairplane). This procurement action will require CReSIS to deploy, operate and maintaintheir custom built suite of three radars for the Operation Ice Bridge Greenland 2010aircraft campaign which will begin in March2010. The Greenland campaign is a series offlights designed to monitor the dynamic areas of the arctic sea ice and Greenland icesheet during the data gap between ICESat-1 andICESat-2, which will not launch until the2014 timeframe. The Cryosphere, including land ice and sea ice are essential areas tomonitor in a warming climate. This requirement also includes the processing of the radardata by CReSIS with their custom processing algorithms and the release of Level 1-B(geolocated radar echograms)data to the IceBridge Science Team three months after thecompletion of the campaign. CReSIS has already gathered data for Operation IceBridge inthe Antarctic 2009 Campaign. No other University or Company has the unique custom builtthree radar suite of instruments developed by CReSIS which includes the capabilities ofimaging fast flowing, rapidly changing glaciers, snow thickness on sea ice and nearsurface firn over the ice sheets. CReSIS has unique UHF (Ultrahigh-frequency)and VHF(Very high-frequency) airborne radars for imaging the near surface firn and snow depth onsea ice at a very high vertical resolution (5 cm). Because CReSIS has designed, developedand built these one of a kind instruments for cryospheric applications and adapted themto the NASA planes, they are the only qualified personnel to operate the instruments inthe field and are the only qualified personnel to repair the instruments.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification and ApprovalForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.  CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Puget Sound Healthcare System (VAPSHCS), VISN 20 Contracting Office, American Lake Division 1600 Veterans Drive, Tacoma, WA.    2.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:  This document sets the justification and approval for award of a purchase order to Datacom Wireall, a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concern, using other than full and open competition in accordance with the Department of Veterans Affairs IL 049-07-08.  The Department of Veterans Affairs IL 049-07-08 changes the priorities for contracting preferences within VA, placing SDVOSB and VOSB first and second, respectively in satisfying VAs acquisitions requirements.  3.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCYS NEEDS: This request is for the procurement of moves, adds, and changes of data lines, telephones, and telecom projects.  Also the contractor will be responsible for trouble-shooting of data, telephone, and miscellaneous telecom equipment at the American Lake and Seattle facility.   The work to be performed by the contractor will support the IT telecom section with mission essential telecom projects at our major campuses.  Awarding the purchase order to Datacom Wireall will enable the VA to have a contract in place with a firm that has the technical knowledge and experience working with various special systems and wiring structures at both sites.     A purchase order for this service was issued to Datacom Wireall on 1 December 2009, purchase order # VA663-C00174.  Short before the expiration of the contract the requesting activity realized that many projects needed to be completed.  At this point, it was too late to put a requirements package together and solicit a new contract. Using noncompetitive procedures at this time is the most advantageous method of acquisition for the Governments requirements based on the following factors: 	Datacom Wireall has performed in a satisfactory manner, has all the equipment and manpower available to perform the required service.  	Datacom Wireall prices reflect the contractors original bid prices.	Awarding a contract to Datacom using noncompetitive procedures will reduce the disruption of services that could occur during a transition of contractors.  	The time and effort involved in preparing a new solicitation and awarding a contract involves a minimum of 45 days, re-soliciting the services would create a break in continuity of services.   4.  AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:   The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement isFAR Part 6-302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute, under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127 &8128 and the Department of Veterans Affairs IL 049-07-08.  5.  ACTIONS TO PROMOTE COMPETITION:  No actions are taken at this time to seek sources outside of statutory requirements. Market research was not conducted due to time constraints and urgency of the services.  6.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE:  The proposed price, when compared with previous acquisition for the same services, it appears to be fair and reasonable.   7.  LISTING OF SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: No sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.8.  STATEMENT OF ACTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: For future requirements for same or similar services, this office will, as appropriate, seek opportunities to increase competition through use of competitive procedures best suited to the circumstances of the contract action.  9.  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  __________________________________	________________________Name:      Theodore D.

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition 1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 5000 W. National Avenue, Bldg. 5, Milwaukee, WI 53295.2.  Nature/Description of Action being Approved:  Justification for other than full and open competition for Teleradiology Services on a sole source basis to CAMRIS International, Inc., a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).        3.  Description of the Services Required:  This contract is for the purchase of Teleradiology Services, to be provided by CAMRIS International, Inc., a SDVOSB, for the period April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011.  Contractor is required to provide all space, supplies, equipment, and labor, to include board certified radiologists, necessary to provide remote after-hours and back-up professional radiology services for six facilities within VISN 12.  Services are required 24/7, 365 days per year.  STAT and Routine interpretations are required by the contractor of Plain Films, Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound (US), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies.  4.  Statutory Authority Permitting other than Full and Open Competition:    This service is being procured through sole-source authority at FAR 6.302-5, under Public Law 109-461, U.S.C. Section 8127 (c) wherein, Contracting Officers may use other than competitive procedures (including sole source contract awards) for contracts to a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), whereas the anticipated price will exceed the Simplified Acquisition Procedures Threshold, but not exceed $5,000,000. 5.  Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisitions:  CAMRIS International, Inc. is the only company that can meet our current time requirement for the commencement of services in support of care to our veterans.  If CAMRIS is not awarded the contract, there will be a lapse in services to patients at six VA facilities within VISN 12.  The current contract, awarded to CAMRIS International, Inc., took approximately two years for the contractor to be able to provide uninterrupted Teleradiology services.  A majority of this time delay was due to information technology and information security requirements and approvals.  Research has shown that it will take at least 6 months for any company other than CAMRIS International, Inc. to receive approval and access into the VA computer systems.  In addition, the credentialing and privileging process for new radiologists to the VA system would take at least 90 days to complete.  VISN 12 is familiar with the radiologists provided by CAMRIS and has a process in place for streamlining the process for re-credentialing of CAMRIS' radiologists at all six facilities.   By using the current contractor, there will be no set-up fees or monthly service charges.  The cost to the government would only be for requested services.  Most importantly, there will be no interruption of services provided to America's veterans.  6.  Efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical:Intent to sole source notice will be posted to FBO for informational purposes only.  7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable Price:  Price reasonableness will be determined based on current contract pricing and current pricing of other VA contracts for Teleradiology Services.  8.  Market Research Conducted:  A search of the VET-Biz Information pages (VIP) listed 18 SDVOSB firms for Teleradiology, only which four have been CVE verified.   CVE verification will be a pre-requisite to sole-source awards after January 1, 2012.  CAMRIS International has already been CVE verified.9.  Any other facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.10.  Actions agency may take to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent actions for the services required:  Market research will again be conducted.  If any future requirement is procured by the GLAC, a SDVOSB competitive solicitation process will most likely be utilized.  11.  Other Sources Expressing an Interest in Writing:  None. 12.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  I hereby determine that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  BECKY CINCOTTAContracting Officer
