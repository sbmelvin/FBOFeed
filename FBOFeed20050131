<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) plans to acquire an enterprise-wide, state-of-the-art Telecommunications Operations Support System (TOSS) to ensure that the new telecommunications infrastructure supports established business needs. This project will build on the environment established by the VA Telecommunications Modernization Project (TMP) to optimize the existing VA Wide Area Network (WAN) into a national integrated services platform.  The TOSS project will focus on the acquisition and development of a single, integrated system that will improve VA’s telecommunications asset and services management.  At a minimum, the system must provide the following components:  service request/order handling; hierarchy code management; invoice tracking and billing reconciliation; telecommunications asset inventory management; and funding allocation.  Furthermore, the VA believes that accountability for telecommunications costs is needed to meet the requirements of the VA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the National Performance Review (NPR), and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB).  RFP # 101-51-04 replaces RFP # 101-38-04 (which was cancelled) and will be available on or October 15, 2004.  This will only be available for download from (BOS) http://www.bos.oamm.va.gov/cgi-bin/WebObjects/BosPublic.woa and/or (Fedbizopps) http://fedbizopps.gov .

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in full and open competition to implement the program described below. The BAOJ has been a joint effort between the Bolivian and U.S. governments since 1992. That year USAID/Bolivia (USAID/B) authorized an eight year BAOJ project to support democratic development in Bolivia through support for the Rule of Law that included institutional reforms and subsequently the implementation of the Code of Criminal Procedures. The latter effort has brought a full criminal system reform in the country aimed at replacing an inquisitorial system for a modern accusatorial, oral one. The Code of Criminal Procedures reforms introduced in Bolivia result in speedier and more transparent trials, and improved democratic participation because it requires citizens to participate fully as citizen judges in the decisions affecting their lives and rights. The BAOJ project is now at a point where further work is needed to strengthen and sustain accomplishments. Emphasis will be on the passage of further enabling legislation, the strengthening of key justice system institutions, and the training of justice system actors to facilitate consolidation of the criminal system reforms.  At the same time, in the coming period, the program must address new problems with respect to social conflicts (nationwide, but particularly in the western highlands and the coca growing regions) and regarding technical support for urgently needed commercial and administrative law reform. The new, five-year BAOJ project's purpose is to a) assist in drafting and passing complementary legal reforms and regulations related to the CCP; b) create an integrated and sustainable capacity of justice system institutions and operators to successfully adapt to the needs of the new CCP and achieve the consolidation of the reforms introduced by the CCP; and (c) promote and implement commercial and administrative law reform to enhance the transparency, consistency and predictability of judicial decision-making and governmental action in the commercial arena. The contractor will continue to expand the legal reforms in progress as well as to strengthen the justice system institutions involved. The contractor will work with indigenous groups and women to address issues related to protection of the more vulnerable groups of society. The contractor will replicate previously piloted activities to facilitate access of the most disadvantaged groups to justice. This will include technical assistance to Integrated Justice Centers.  An Integrated Justice Center (IJC) is a site or group of sites that concentrates a variety of formal and informal justice services to increase access to justice in neglected areas where there are high levels of social conflict.  Such assistance will include work with the GOB to improve local government financing and to provide institutional, financial and advisory support in an attempt to achieve sustainability of the IJCs. The contractor will work closely with other projects in the democracy sector such as the legislative strengthening project, and the Civil Society for Justice Reforms Netwrok to share information regarding activities to date and to identify issues/problems that may require assistance. The contractor will also work closely with other USAID/B Strategic Objective Teams (SOTs), such as the Alternative Development team to pursue the objectives of the BAOJ. One Performance-based Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract will be awarded for implementation of these activities. Implementation will occur over a five year period. Further information about exact location and time will be forthcoming. We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a February 26, 2004. Contact person is Jose Zenteno: Phone 591-2-2786445, Fax 591-2-278568

<DESC>This requirement is for miscellaneous construction support services for Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), primarily for minor new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, maintenance and repair work, typically for commercial office buildings but may also include some residential treatment facilities.  The government intends on awarding one, or more, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract(s) to eligible 8(a) firm(s) through a competitive source selection process.  The competition will be restricted to eligible 8 (a) firms currently maintaining a bona fide branch office in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Area (DC, VA, MD, WV).  A bona fide branch office is a place where an 8(a) participant regularly maintains a construction management office employing at least one full-time individual within the DC Metropolitan Area geographic boundary.  The successful 8(a) participant(s) will be selected using a best value approach, with past performance (in particular, demonstrated ability to meet performance schedules) being more important than price.  Price will be evaluated based on a real, or simulated, construction project.  (The government reserves the right to independently obtain past performance information after receipt of proposals.)

The task order-specific Scopes of Work for the non-commercial construction services under the IDIQ may be comprised of performance-based, design-build, or a combination thereof.  (Any design work will be incidental in comparison to the construction requirements for all projects.)  Individual task order requirements will be negotiated on a firm-fixed price basis using the R.S. Means “Square Foot Costs book” (for 2005) as the common negotiation tool.  Projects will occur in various physical spaces occupied by CSOSA throughout the District of Columbia.  Task Orders issued after award will consist of a broad range of minor new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, maintenance and repair work, primarily for commercial office buildings but may also include some residential treatment facilities.  Work will include tasks in a variety of trades such as carpentry, painting, installation services, plumbing, painting, masonry, welding, HVAC, electrical distribution, etc.  The contractor shall furnish all materials, labor, plant, tools, transportation, equipment, testing services insurance  and quality control and incidentals necessary to meet the task order-specific Scope of Work (SOW).  All work shall be performed in accordance with the technical standards of the basic IDIQ, and the task-order specific SOW.  The typical range of required construction services includes mechanical, electrical, and plumbing skills as well as experience with commercial painting and flooring treatments.  

The estimated period of performance shall be a base year, with four one-year option periods.  The anticipated dollar value is an estimated $250,000 for the base year and for each of the one-year option periods, with a total estimated contract value of $1,250,000.  This amount may be reduced if multiple (not more than two (2)) contracts are awarded.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the amount of work to be ordered, however, a minimum amount of $25,000 is guaranteed for each performance year, for each contract awarded.  The minimum guaranteed funding amount will be reduced by the issuance of task orders during the period of performance.  Individual task orders will typically range from $2,500 to $25,000.  Contract award(s) will not preclude CSOSA from acquiring construction services through other acquisition methods during the life of the contract(s).  The primary NAICS code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $28.5MIL.

It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 14 January  2005 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http:// www. eps. gov    The solicitation will contain the mandatory response time and submittal requirements.  Paper copies will not be made available.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon interested parties to review this web site frequently for any updates / amendments to any and all documents.  No telephone requests for this solicitation will be accepted.  Firms are reminded registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http:// www. ccr. gov is mandatory.  This acquisition is set-aside for firms certified for participation in the 8(a) Program serviced by the Washington Metropolitan Area District of the 8 (a) Business Development Program.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.

(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.

       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractor’s receipt of an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.  A Contractor’s request for, and participation in, ADR will not toll the 90 day time limit within which to appeal an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision to the Chief, Procurement Branch.  
       (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment.

<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice.  Proposals are not requested at this time. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance, has a requirement for: Specialized Technical, Analytical, and Administrative Services for the Office of Classification and Information Control.  This requirement will replace two (2) existing contract numbers: DE-AC01-03SO20138 with Systems Management and Research Technologies Corporation (SMARTECH) Inc. and DE-AC01-04SO20188 with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).   These two contracts have historically been conducted as separate procurements to support different program managers in the Office of Security.  In April 2004, the Office of Security (SO) and the Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance (OA) were merged into a single organization entitled the Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA). As part of the organization of SSA, the two (2) offices which held these contracts, the Office of Information Classification and Control Policy (ICCP), SO-12, and the Office of Classified and Controlled Information Review (CCIR), SO-70, were merged into the Office of Classification and Information Control, SO-10.2. The support required under these contracts is to develop, manage, and implement policies and procedures to identify highly-classified nuclear technology in support of non-proliferation objectives.   Both contracts: (1) require similar personnel qualifications, training, and certification to perform highly-technical document reviews; (2) provide guidance support in (a) DOE nuclear guide development and writing, and (b) historical electronic library development and provision; and, (3) provide administrative support to conduct technically complex studies, analyses, and reporting.  The integration of these activities is integral to the Departmentâ€™s mission and the achievement of National Security A five (5) year contract consisting of a one year base period and four one-year option periods is contemplated.  The estimated Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLHs) are anticipated to be 185,000 hour per year.  This will be an unrestricted procurement.  The solicitation will be issued electronically via the Department of Energy Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS).

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration/Office of Acquisition Management (DEA/FAC), Arlington, VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements for hazardous waste removal and disposal services.  The contractor is not responsible for the remedial cleanup and disposal of residual waste, which may remain after the removal of gross contamination.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 562112; the average annual receipt is $10.5 million dollars.  It is anticipated that services will be needed in the contract areas listed below with the corresponding contract centers in parentheses.  Contract Area 1-03 Washington State & Northern Idaho (Seattle and Spokane, WA); Contract Area 2-03 Oregon (Portland); Contract Area 4-03 Northern California (Sacramento & Fresno); Contract Area 5-03 Central California (Los Angeles); Contract Area 6-03 Southern California (San Diego); Contract Area 7-03 Southern Idaho (Boise); Contract Area 11-03 Montana (Billings); Contract Area 12-03 Wyoming (Cheyenne); Contract Area 16-03 New Mexico (Albuquerque); Contract Area 17-03 West Texas (Odessa); Contract Area 43-03 New York (Syracuse); Contract Area 44-03 New England (Boston): This area includes the entire states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The objective of the BPAs is to secure the services of contractors who are qualified by federal, state, and local laws to perform the duties of a “generator” of hazardous waste on behalf of law enforcement agencies and to properly manage the hazardous waste seized by those in law enforcement at clandestine drug laboratories, generated by DEA’s forensic laboratories, mobile laboratories, training exercises, or by other waste-generating activities authorized by DEA.    The period of performance is from the effective date of the BPA, until cancelled by either party, however, not to exceed a maximum of sixty months from the effective date.  Interested sources must submit the following information:  Name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, and Primary Residences (City and State) for the past ten (10) years for all owners and officers of the company.  This will be used to conduct criminal record checks. Offerors with a felony committed by one of these persons will not receive a BPA.  Interested sources must also list the contract areas of interest and fill out an information sheet for each contract area of interest.  Interested sources must provide pricing lists for each contract area of interest.  Price lists that are reasonable and comparable to industry standards for the applicable contract areas will receive more favorable consideration during the evaluation process.  A quick response time is essential, so those offerors with response facilities located within the Government designated contract center will receive more favorable consideration during the evaluation process.     The Request for Quote information will be posted through the DEA Acquisitions web page at www.dea.gov on or about February 7, 2005. See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>This is a synopsis/solicitation for commercial services for design and transitional  support prepared in accordance with (IAW) the format in FAR Part 8, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This Request for Quotation (RFQ) is limited to current GSA Federal Supply Schedule Holders as defined under FAR Part 8.  

Request for Quotation NumberRFQ HQ0422-05-T-0001 is attached to this notice.  As FAR Part 8 requirement, all the clauses incorporated in the offeror’s GSA Schedule shall be applicable and any additional clauses that are in the RFQ.

This RFQ is for providing design, development and transitional support services to the Defense Finance & Accounting Service, MilPay System Transition Program Office (MSTPO), Cleveland Center.  Please review the RFQ carefully and ensure your response is compliant with all requirements cited in the RFQ.  

The MilPay System Transition Program Office (MSTPO) is responsible for transitioning legacy military pay functionality to the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) Personnel/Pay (Pers/Pay), the objective integrated military personnel and pay system for the Department of Defense (DoD). The pay component of DIMHRS (Pers/Pay) will replace all military pay systems existing at the time of deployment and serve as the single integrated payroll capability for Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard members around the world. DIMHRS (Pers/Pay) is an Acquisition Category I (ACAT I) Program.  DoD Directives relating to the development and acquisition of Major Automated Information Systems (AIS) will be used throughout the DIMHRS (Pers/Pay) life cycle.

Another MSTPO responsibility is the design and development of the Forward Compatible Payroll (FCP) system, the near-term replacement of the Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS).  DJMS is the DFAS system that provides pay support to the Active Duty, Reserve and Guard components of the Army, Navy and Air Force.  The new payroll capability, and all associated design documents and materials, will be made available to the DIMHRS (Pers/Pay) program for potential reuse as, or in support of, the payroll component of DIMHRS (Pers/Pay). DoD Directives that apply to an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) program are being followed during the development and deployment of FCP. 

It is anticipated that the resulting order will be a base (first) period with four (4) option years.  A time and material/labor hour price quotation is requested for the effort.  

The anticipated award will be a “best value” award and all quotations will be evaluated according to the factors for selection outlined in the RFQ.  Replies may be made by mail, fax or e-mail to the Contracting Point of Contact (POC) listed and comply with the attached RFQ information and instructions.

Special Note:  This is currently an unfunded requirement,  we anticipate that funding will be provided in the near future.  However, this procurement may be delayed until this requirement is fully funded and offeror’s are to take this notice into account when they bid on this requirement.

Questions concerning this RFQ will be accepted through 3:00 PM EDT, February 14, 2005 via e-mail only.  All questions and answers shall be posted by amendment to the RFQ.

Quotations will be due 3:00 PM EDT, March 1, 2005.  Quotations received after the above date and time may not be considered for award.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, NC intends to procure 1 each, hydraulic tube bending machine, P/N CNC-040.  The government intends to procure this bending machine on a sole source basis from Pines Manufacturing, Inc., 30505 Clemens Road, Westlake, OH, cage code 028Q7.  This is the manufacturer.  The database of this machine must be compatible with the smaller units being produced by Pines for mobile facilities in support of the V-22 Osprey.  This will allow all of the stored dimensions of the hydraulic lines that have been loaded to be transferred from the CNC-040 to the smaller hydraulic tube bender or from the smaller unit to the CNC-040 if either one of the units break down.  In addition, the memory cards must be compatible so that they can be taken to any of the other MALS units that have a Pines machine and utilized to manufacture the required hydraulic lines.  No other source can provide equipment that meets the above requirements.  Delivery will be made to:  MALS 29 Supply, MCAS New River, Jacksonville, NC.  See numbered note 22.

<CONTACT>Carol Brown 202-781-4875
<DESC>Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will be procuring a Shipboard Protection System (SPS) to support Shipboard and Expeditionary Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) initiatives. An RFI for this system was issued 29 September 2004 under Solicitation # N00024-04-R-6234. The revised Solicitation # is N00024-05-R-6304. NAVSEA intends to issue the solicitation on approximately 23 December 2004 for a period of 45 days. In order to accommodate questions, the Performance Specification and SOW will be released prior to the solicitation for review and comments. The Performance Specification is attached to this announcement.  The SOW will be posted on approximately 29 November 2004. SPS DESCRIPTION: SPS consists of shipboard installed mission specific hardware, software, and firmware components that will enable a “Navy combatant vessel” to perform anti-terrorism / force protection (AT/FP) functions.  SPS will enhance the ability for Naval vessels to accomplish self-protection while moored to a pier, at anchor, or during restricted maneuvering.  SPS will provide the Navy with a fully integrated and seamless sensor, analysis, and response system that will provide the means for 360o situational awareness and engagement capability to counter asymmetric AT/FP threats around-the-clock with no increase in manning.  The operational concept for the initial and objective systems is to provide a flexible layered defense with situational awareness, deterrence, and engagement zones being defined by the system operator.  This system should be modular and expandable and should support installation / operation on multiple ship classes / platforms within the Navy.  The ! initial increment of this system must immediately provide the ability to support stand-alone operations for a single vessel and must be designed to be ultimately integrated within multi-ship and/or shore side AT/FP envelopes.  This capability must be available, operable, and supportable in both overseas and continental U.S. ports and waterways.  This capability will provide surveillance, detection, identification, tracking, deterrence, engagement, and command & control functions for both own-ship and own-ship deployable assets that can be applied to appropriately counter surface, subsurface, and airborne threats.  SPS Increment I will be designed to counter multiple asymmetric surface waterborne threats.  This increment will use, but not limited to, existing organic shipboard capabilities plus the following capabilities: 1)	Enhanced detection and tracking of surface targets 2)	A capability to hail and warn small boat crews and surfaced swimmers 3)	A basic situational awareness capability to aid in Force Protection (FP) 4)	Enhanced control of shipboard lethal weapon systems and enhance the display and availability of information to decision makers for the employment of small arms 5)	A basic open architecture Force Protection (FP) command and control (C2) system. Please review the Performance Specification and the forthcoming SOW and provide comments and questions to brownca@navsea.navy.mil. All comments and questions must be received electronically.  Do not phone-in any questions or comments, they will not be answered or considered.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, , Panama City, Florida (NSWC PC), intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price contract to Intermed Video Technologies, Inc. of Newtown CT for eleven (11) each 17” and thirty-three (33) each 10.4” video monitors to accomplish Craft Alterations on the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC). This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The Intermed Video Technology monitors were uniquely and independently developed for the LCAC as drop-in replacements for the existing LCAC monitors under Craft Alteration 506K but were developed with additional capabilities over and above the existing monitors. These unique characteristics include: (a) The upgraded graphics engine enables the old Alarm and Monitoring System (AMS) & Navigation Data Integrator (NDI) 945 video standards and the Litton radar signals to be displayed on the same unit, as well as the hi-resolution Furuno RADAR (1280 x 1024) format that can be directly displayed on the 10.4" unit that has a native resolution of 1024 x 768. (b) The design package for CRAFTALT 506K as approved by NAVSEA requires the use of the Intermed Video monitors. (c) Resolution is SXGA, 1280 x 1024 for 17 inch display, and 1024 x 768 for 10.4 inch display (d) Sunlight readable, High Brightness up to 1500 nits, Integrated night vision capability (e) Multi-standard video inputs (f) Military Specification qualified switches on front panel (g) Auto switchable signal input (h) Dual input (i) The Unique power supplies operate from 28V DC or 85V AC to 285V AC / 47Hz to 440Hz. The power connectors mate with existing craft harness and require no manual switching to operate from 28V DC or AC operation. (j) Drop in replacement for existing LCAC Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays. No craft alteration required for installation of the monitors. (k) The viewing surface is hardened and is shatterproof laminated glass (not plastic). This eliminates scratches that always occur with plastic surfaces and protects the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) surface from casual impact damage. Additionally, as the sole developer of these monitors, only Intermed Video Technologies has the in-depth knowledge of the design required to deliver the required equipment.   Numbered Note 22 applies.

NSWC PC is tasked with conducting a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program to identify improved skirt materials for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC).  The requirement to identify potential foreign-made alternative LCAC skirt materials was advertised previously in a Sources Sought Announcement. Under a phase 1 effort, near-term type 1 test materials from the identified FCT vendors were previously procured and delivered, and are now being evaluated in on-craft installations and laboratory evaluation of the material.  A phase 2 effort is now planned, to obtain and test more advanced skirt materials, with the goal of increased performance over the phase 1 materials.  This procurement is to procure the phase 2 material from Reeves, one of the approved FCT vendors.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for ! the following reason:  This material procurement is a continuation of the FCT effort, so should be limited to the previously approved FCT vendors that are currently participating in the program.  The inclusion of new vendors at this point would adversely impact the program schedule and budget.  NAICS Code 313320 Applies. SBA Size Standard is 1000 Employees. FSC 9320.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 Commercial and Simplified procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MTS Systems Corporation of Ann Arbor, Michigan to update test automation software that is used in a Heavy Duty Test Cell at the US EPA NVFEL facility. The software updates will provide the data communication link from the test cell automation system to a Horiba Particulate Sampler Unit (PSU).  The software update is needed because the PSU is being updated to a new model.  The new PSU has three separate heated sample systems which are designed to take three PM samples concurrently.  Each heated sample system has four filter holders to collect PM samples from up to four sequential test phases.  The updated software will control the collection of the PM sample under both automated test sequences and manual operation.  The proper controls and response data will be handled by this software update including revisions to the data processing software component, in order to process the data and calculate mass emissions.   The software to be updated and the driver that interfaces with the PSUs is proprietary to MTS Systems and is password protected.  The contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, including all quality assurance, installation, design, calibration, commissioning and acceptance testing.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO 9000 standards. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by February 14, 2005 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract.

The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Integrated Program Office (IPO) (www.npoess.noaa.gov) has prepared an Announcement of Opportunity for the NPOESS P3I initiative. This document is available at the following NPOESS FTP website: ftp://ftp.ipo.noaa.gov. Please call Mr. Sjoberg or Mr. Naegeli for ftp site password. The file folder is called P3I Announcement of Opportunity. All parties are invited to review this document and respond with their proposals not later than 5pm Eastern Time on 18 MAR 2005. Proposals should be written in Microsoft Word format and should be uploaded into the AO Proposals folder of the ftp site. Please password-protect your file.  An additional copy of your proposal should be emailed along with the password for your proposal to Mr. Sjoberg or Mr. Naegeli to ensure redundancy.  The NPOESS IPO will not pay for any party's efforts in responding to this request.  In addition to interested academic, science, and industry parties, representatives of government programs from DoD, NASA, and NOAA that have already selected payloads through a competitive, peer-reviewed process, are invited to respond to this Announcement of Opportunity.  BACKGROUND: The purpose of P3I is to make unused space on NPOESS satellites available to Government, academic, science, and industry parties on a non-interference basis (the NPOESS mission is of paramount importance, and a P3I payload must not interfere with the NPOESS mission) when potential P3I payloads help meet NPOESS needs, help meet other Government needs, or provide benefit to science. The P3I initiative provides the potential for testing advanced technology in earth orbit and validating advanced instruments in space and cross-calibrating them with existing instruments. The NPOESS IPO anticipates that any P3I payload provider will bear all costs of designing and building its payload, as well as all costs of integrating its payload onto a NPOESS satellite and data routing or distribution beyond the NPOESS portal, with the NPOESS IPO providing only satellite space, power, and data transfer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

CSOSA anticipates awarding a contract for a one-year base period of performance and four (4) one-year options. CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in, and on behalf of, the District of Columbia. Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities. In executing this mission, CSOSA operates from a variety of leased spaces  in the District of Columbia. Prospective offerors must currently maintain a bona fide office in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Area (DC, VA, MD). A bona fide office is a place where the firm regularly maintains a management office providing full service business support. Typical leasing services may include, but are not limited to, (1) developing lease acquisition strategy in support of CSOSA, (2) conducting preliminary market surveys / analysis and zoning research for buildings / sites that might satisfy CSOSA’s requirements, (3) providing negotiation support for leases (4) preparing lease forms and negotiation documentation, (5) performing follow-up on lease terms and deadlines as negotiated in the leases. Firms must be familiar with GSA leasing standards, procedures and forms, as well as Federal Acquisition Regulations, applicable DC codes and commercial real estate / development industry practices. The successful firm will be selected using a best value approach, with technical criteria (Demonstrated Corporate Capability, Personnel Qualifications, Past Performance) being equal in importance to price / cost. The primary NAICS code is 531390, Other Activities Related to Real Estate, with a small business size standard of $1.5 MIL. This announcement is open to all businesses,  regardless of size.

Response:  Two or more business entities can form a joint venture for  purposes of competing for  a government procurement.  If the two entities have  a formal mentor-protégé relationship one of them may be a large business.  The  mentor-protégé joint venture may compete as a small business so long as the  protégé qualifies as small under the applicable NAICS code.   The small  business must perform a significant portion of the work.  SBA must evaluate  and  approve the joint venture on a case by case basis.  The joint venture also  must  comply with SBA rules and reporting requirements designed to demonstrate an  expanding role for the small business involved in the joint venture.      b.  “02_RDD_CAPS_Schedule_08Dec2004_Amend08”:    Consolidated  Acquisition  of  Professional  Services  (CAPS) Schedule (As of 08 Dec 2004) 1.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
     (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
     (iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor”.
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
       (e) For the Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.

       (f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals to the Chief, Procurement Branch, UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries within 90 days of the date of the Contractor’s receipt of the adverse decision.  The decision of the Chief, Procurement Branch on a Contractor’s appeal will be final.
       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractor’s receipt of an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.  A Contractor’s request for, and participation in, ADR will not toll the 90 day time limit within which to appeal an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision to the Chief, Procurement Branch.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer contractor questions regarding the Swept Frequency Test Set Synopsis No. N68335-05-R-0001.

The following is provided for informational purposes.

1.	Contractor Question:  Will this unit be stationary or portable?

Government Response:  Portable (size and weight guidelines included in the RFP)

2.	Contractor Question:  Can we arrange a site visit to see the legacy equipment and meet the engineers?
Government Response:  We do not believe that sharing any information on the Legacy unit would be beneficial.  The unit design for this new unit should differ significantly from the legacy unit and the performance characteristics are also expected to be  different.  In short, we believe providing any data pictures etc regarding the AN/USM-482A would misguide any potential offerors away from the requirements and specification soon to be released.

3.	Contractor Question: If not, do you have pictures of the legacy unit for our evaluation?

 	Government Response:  See Government response for question 2.

4.	Contractor Question: Is their a Technical Data Package available for the legacy unit?

Government Response: No. 

5.	Contractor Question:  Who was the original manufacture of the legacy unit?

Government Response:  U.S. Navy, NAC Indiannapolis

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above by 4:00 p.m. on Monday January 31, 2004. The DOI - National Business Center (NBC), Denver has a requirement for reporting software.  The NBC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Softec Solutions, Inc. for the purchase of Optio Software.  Based on previous market research, the Government believes that Optio Software possesses the necessary capabilities that will satisfy agency requirements, and work in conjunction with certain Oracle applications already in place at the NBC.   Based on the information available at this time and the proprietary nature of the software, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the item specified to be available from Softec Solutions, Inc.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  All interested firms must be certified as authorized re-sellers of Optio Software.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if a competitive opportunity exists. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is seeking small businesses that have the capablity of providing formation pertaining to the feasibility of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Rear Ground Handling Wheel (RGHW).  The RGHW is planned to be used on the following H-1 Model aircraft (AH-1Z and UH-1Y).  A pair (two) RGHW units are required to lift the aircraft from attachment points located on the rear of the 4 inch diameter aircraft skids.  Skid lugs provide the interface for attachment.  The dimensions, constraints and sketches for the skid lug and each aircraft will be provide upon request.  RGHW installation and removal from the aircraft should not require any special tooling, disassembly or assembly.  Rapid installation and removal by one person is required.  Maximum safe working limits for the RGHW are required to meet a maximum aircraft weight of 20,000 lbs.  The RGHW should allow for easy transport, by one person in a standing/walking position, to and from the aircraft.  It is desired that overall weight of the RGHW be keep to a minimum.  The target weight for a RGHW unit is 90 lbs or less.  RGHW should feature non-castering pneumatic wheels, which are suitable for towing speeds up to 10 MPH on pavement, shipboard non-skid decking and unmade surfaces such as gravel, dirt and stone.  The RGHW is required to lift the aircraft to a minimum height of 3.5 inches measured from the ground to the bottom of the skid at a point between the attachment skid lugs.  The RGHW lifting mechanism should not require external power (such as electric or pneumatic).  Actuation of the lifting mechanism, by one person, per RGHW unit, is a requirement. The RGHW is required to have a mechanism to allow the rapid lowering of the skids to the ground.  The target time to completely lower the skids is 3 seconds.  The RGHW requires a method for remote activation of the rapid lowing mechanism, which can be reached by one person during aircraft towing or spotting.  The remote activation device should be designed to fit the smallest RGHW envelope dimensions for stowage.  The remote activation device should not require any tooling to install on, or remove from, the RGHW.  When installed, the remote actuation device should be accessible at a target distance of 36 inches from the RGHW center and at a target height of 24 inches from the ground.  Location of the remote actuation device is limited due to aircraft configurations.  Access to the remote actuation device should be in line with the skid tube and either forward or aft of the RGHW.  A design goal is to have a remote activation device that can be positioned either forward or aft of the RGHW.  The envelope dimensions for the RGHW unit, not including the remote activation device is available upon request.  Note that there are multiple aircraft configurations that will limit the envelope dimensions.  NAICS 336413 applies.  Please provide information that would demostrate your company’s manufacturing capabilties and any other documentation that would describe the ability to produce, manufacture and delivery the above requirement.  It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 2/15/05 to Ms. Nancy Delaney, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25221B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at: Nancy.Delaney@navy.mil.  Ms. Delaney may be reached at (732) 323-4478.  Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from the RFI.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent with costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>SEEKING VENDOR (S) WITH EXTENSIVE HOTEL PROPERTIES DATABASE, ABILITY TO CONDUCT MEALS STUDY, PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER SERVICES AND INDUSTRY EXPERTISE.

Purpose:

The Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP), Office of Transportation and Personal Property, Travel Management Policy Division (MTT) seeks information from vendors with qualifications and past experience: 
(1)	Developing, maintaining and producing industry data reports based on verified and updated historical database of a minimum of 40,000 hotel properties within CONUS.  Capable of producing standard and customized reports of hotel industry data including cost, demand/supply, day of week analysis; identification of lodging properties that are approved by the FEMA as being fire-safe and in compliance with the Hotel-Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (PL 101-391), and daily rate information by hotel industry segment.  Experience graphically depicting properties within the CONUS.  Industry and investors rely on the database reports for financial performance and business decisions;
(2)	Conducting meals surveys and statistical analyses;
(3)	Developing subscriber services that allow MTT to select variables that impact outputs; and 
(4)	Providing travel consulting when requested by MTT.

The intent of the RFI response is to:  
·	Provide the Government information on the capabilities of the vendor community in providing the aforementioned services.

RFI Questionnaire:

1.	Do you have a database of at least 40,000 hotel properties reporting information to you that is updated on a monthly basis and verified for accuracy?
2.	What past experience does your firm posses related to the four items listed under purpose that would be relevant to per diem study?
3.	What capability and qualifications does your firm possess that would be beneficial to the government to establish the annual CONUS per diem rates for the Federal government?
4.	What past experience do you posses in this field with other firms or Federal Agencies?

BACKGROUND:

The General Services Administration (GSA), OGP, MTT is required by law to annually establish the CONUS maximum per diem rates which Federal employees are reimbursed for expenses incurred while on official business travel at a temporary duty location (TDY) within the Continental United States (CONUS).  MTT’s mission under the CONUS per diem program is to ensure that Federal travelers are fairly and equitably compensated for their travel expenses while protecting the Government’s financial interest.

Most of the 8,000-plus CONUS locations to which Federal employees travel on an annual basis are covered by the standard CONUS per diem rate, which is currently $91 ($60 for lodging and $31 for M&IE).  In addition to the standard CONUS rate, there are approximately 420 non-standard locations (previously referred to as designated locations) within CONUS that have a maximum per diem rate that is higher than the standard CONUS rate based on higher travel costs within these locations.

The maximum per diem established for a location is comprised of three components: a lodging, meal and incidental expense (M&IE) allowances.  While combined to create one maximum per diem rate, the lodging portion of a per diem rate is established separately from the M&IE portion.  The lodging portions of per diem rates for the 420 non-standard locations are reviewed annually; while the lodging portion of the standard CONUS per diem rate is reviewed every three years.  The standard CONUS rate was last adjusted for Fiscal Year (FY) 2005.  It will not be reviewed again until FY 2008.  The incidental expense allowance is reviewed and changed as needed.

MTT bases CONUS lodging per diem rates in non-standard locations upon their Average Daily Rate (ADR), a lodging industry metric calculated from the economic factors of rental revenue of properties in each non-standard location divided by number of rooms rented by those properties over a specific period of time.  To accomplish the review of per diem lodging locations, MTT contracts with a travel industry data research firm that collects and provides an ADR for each location.  MTT sets the appropriate lodging rate for each location after an extensive analysis and review of this contractor-provided data.
 
For meals, MTT contracts with a data research firm to conduct a survey of appropriate restaurants that result in data for the meals portion of the per diem rates.  The last comprehensive meals study was conducted in 1997, effective in FY98.  In FY97, approximately 3,500-2 or 3 star/diamond (as rated by AAA or Mobil or comparable where there are an insufficient number of 2 or 3 star properties) restaurants were surveyed in both standard CONUS and about 400 non-standard locations.  MTT will conduct a meals survey in FY05 and in FY08 to update the meals portion of the per diem rates.  In non-survey years, the meals rate is adjusted by applying meals away from home Consumer Price Index to the prior year’s meal rate.  MTT is also requesting the vendor to present alternative approaches to a meal survey, which are more cost effective.

As the establishment of the CONUS per diem rates is a resource intensive process, MTT is seeking appropriate solutions to lesson the human resources burden.  Another task will be for the vendor to develop a subscriber services to establish per diem rates.  This service will produce reports with current data, backup documentation and allow MTT to easily change variables and produce reports based on these changes. This service will produce all reports and supporting documentation for per diem rates deemed necessary by MTT.

Vendors’ responses to the RFI must be submitted via email to kisha.emmanuel@gsa.gov no later than 1.00 pm EST, February 7, 2005. 
Questions regarding any aspect of this RFI should be emailed to kisha.emmanuel@gsa.gov.  RFI responses must conform to the below format and provide the following information: No questions will be accepted by phone.

I. Cover Letter

The cover letter must include the following information:
§	Company name.
§	Company point of contact and telephone number.
§	Date submitted.
§	Any applicable GSA FSS schedule contracts or any other existing Federal government contract vehicles.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission under the Living With a Star program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA’s understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years and three months, and is scheduled for launch in April 2008. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the SDO Solar Array.  The present requirements are specified in the attached, Draft 1, documents, as follows: 1) Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work (SOW) for Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project Solar Array Panels and Qualification Panel (464-PWR-LEGL-0061), 2) Exhibit 2 –Specification for the Solar Array Panels and Qualification Panel for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project (464-PWR-SPEC-0110), and 3) Exhibit 3- Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project Solar Array Panels and Qualification Panel Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS) (464-PWR-LEGL-0062).  Please note that NASA GSFC Interface Control Drawing No. GE 2062592, “Cells, Substrate Interface Solar Array”, will be made available upon request to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Lorrie L. Eakin.  Ms. Eakin may be contacted via telephone at (301) 286-9403 or by email at Lorrie.L.Eakin@nasa.gov. This notice is issued by the NASA GSFC to post a draft SOW, Specification, and DILS via the Internet, and to solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA GSFC’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  NASA GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project. This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of the sessions is to provide dialog in which participants can provide feedback on NASA GSFC requirements and its acquisition approach.  The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1), Specification (Exhibit 2) and DILS (Exhibit 3). NASA GSFC is particularly interested in comments on the SDO project’s contemplated increase in the power required from the array (by as much as 6% over that specified in the attached documents) without increasing the substrate size (over that currently specified in the attached documents).  Also, the SDO project solicits your feedback on the size of the qualification panel(s) needed to meet the requirements. Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: 1) Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the SOW, Specification, and DILS. Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comment(s) that either describe how a potential offeror’s solar array could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror’s position on such requirement.  This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions.  It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable. 2) Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule, and 3) Summary of past relevant experience in developing spacecraft solar arrays.  Please advise if this requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in Internet “Note A”.

<SUBJECT>B--AERONAUTICAL MOBILE COMMUNICATION NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (MCNA) SIMULATION, EMULATION AND DEMONSTRATION CAPABILITIES
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICIATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. In responding to this notice, please refer to “Aeronautical Mobile Communication Network Architecture (MCNA) Simulation, Emulation and Demonstration Capabilities.” Send information/literature/qualification statement no later than February 17, 2005 to the e-mail or postal address as provided herein.  NASA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to provide information relative to the goals set forth below. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about existing and near-future, high fidelity simulation, emulation and demonstration capabilities to support the validation of proposed concepts and enabling technologies for an aeronautical Mobile Communication Network Architecture (MCNA).  The MCNA encompasses the mobile digital voice and data communication capabilities required to support communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) services for future Air Traffic Management (ATM) operations.  A clearly defined MCNA is a key element for transformation of the National Airspace System (NAS) towards Network Enabled Operations (NEO). The MCNA extends voice and data information services defined in the NAS System Wide Information Management (SWIM) concept to all mobile elements of the NAS, including aircraft during all phases of flight.  Transition to this future MCNA would begin in the 2009 – 2015 time period, and the useful life of the system should be at least 20 to 30 years.   The information received in response to this RFI will be used by NASA GRC in support of a collaborative MCNA Study with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (as part of the Global Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance System (GCNSS) Phase II contract with the Air Traffic Management Division of Boeing Corporation).  The FAA/NASA GRC MCNA Study will help to define MCNA requirements and evaluate them against existing and planned communications capabilities in the NAS to identify gaps and/or inconsistencies that must be addressed either through the enhancement of current systems and capabilities or the development of new MCNA systems. The study includes the evaluation of the requirements, architecture and associated transition plans.   NASA GRC responsibilities include the identification of U.S. national capabilities needed to validate the 2015 mobile communications network architecture for use in NEO and SWIM.  This RFI is intended to provide input for conducting Task 2.5: Simulation, Emulations, Demonstrations, where candidate simulation models and tools and emulation environments are required to validate proposed MCNA concepts, strategies and enabling technologies.  This includes identification of unique facilities and capabilities that exist or are planned within the U.S. at NASA Centers, FAA Facilities, federally-funded organizations, and companies.	The Boeing Corporation is under contract with the FAA to assist NASA GRC in the identification of simulation, emulation, and demonstration capabilities.  They and other direct contractors of NASA and the FAA for this effort (including but not limited to ITT Industries, Honeywell, Avaliant LLC, and Tectura Corp.) will have access to the information submitted, but only for the specific purpose of helping NASA to develop plans for validating the performance and operational scenarios of integrated communications infrastructure architecture and identification of concepts for demonstrations (in the relevant environment) of the capabilities enabled by the MCNA.	 It is desirable that information provided to describe relevant simulation, emulation and demonstration capabilities relevant to aeronautical mobile communications include: •	A technical description of the simulation, emulation, and demonstration capability including but not limited to: tool name, vendor, capability description, hardware supported, and operating system. •	Description of existing application(s) of the tool to support simulation, emulation, and demonstration for the purposes of validating concepts, strategies, and/or technologies in the context of an air traffic management (ATM) environment (in particular the National Airspace System – NAS) and/or aeronautical network enabled environment.  This would include descriptions of specific ATM/NAS related models, some discussion/details of how they have been used, and a brief history of the process and for what purpose they were developed.  Sample outputs, screenshots, and other graphical samples would be useful. •	A description of the level of fidelity of the tool/capability with regards to the actual ATM/NAS and/or NEO related system(s) it simulates, emulates, or demonstrates, and whether or not and how the tool/capability has been validated by the FAA, NASA, or other recognized authority.  •	Availability of the tool to support future aeronautical MCNA design and development. •	Technical maturity of the simulation, emulation and demonstration capability and areas/timeframe for planned upgrades and improvements.  For the purposes of providing clarity in the scope of responses desired, the following list of examples is included.

<SUBJECT>B--AERONAUTICAL MOBILE COMMUNICATION NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (MCNA) SIMULATION, EMULATION AND DEMONSTRATION CAPABILITIES
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICIATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. In responding to this notice, please refer to “Aeronautical Mobile Communication Network Architecture (MCNA) Simulation, Emulation and Demonstration Capabilities.” Send information/literature/qualification statement no later than February 17, 2005 to the e-mail or postal address as provided herein.  NASA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to provide information relative to the goals set forth below. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about existing and near-future, high fidelity simulation, emulation and demonstration capabilities to support the validation of proposed concepts and enabling technologies for an aeronautical Mobile Communication Network Architecture (MCNA).  The MCNA encompasses the mobile digital voice and data communication capabilities required to support communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) services for future Air Traffic Management (ATM) operations.  A clearly defined MCNA is a key element for transformation of the National Airspace System (NAS) towards Network Enabled Operations (NEO). The MCNA extends voice and data information services defined in the NAS System Wide Information Management (SWIM) concept to all mobile elements of the NAS, including aircraft during all phases of flight.  Transition to this future MCNA would begin in the 2009 – 2015 time period, and the useful life of the system should be at least 20 to 30 years.   The information received in response to this RFI will be used by NASA GRC in support of a collaborative MCNA Study with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (as part of the Global Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance System (GCNSS) Phase II contract with the Air Traffic Management Division of Boeing Corporation).  The FAA/NASA GRC MCNA Study will help to define MCNA requirements and evaluate them against existing and planned communications capabilities in the NAS to identify gaps and/or inconsistencies that must be addressed either through the enhancement of current systems and capabilities or the development of new MCNA systems. The study includes the evaluation of the requirements, architecture and associated transition plans.   NASA GRC responsibilities include the identification of U.S. national capabilities needed to validate the 2015 mobile communications network architecture for use in NEO and SWIM.  This RFI is intended to provide input for conducting Task 2.5: Simulation, Emulations, Demonstrations, where candidate simulation models and tools and emulation environments are required to validate proposed MCNA concepts, strategies and enabling technologies.  This includes identification of unique facilities and capabilities that exist or are planned within the U.S. at NASA Centers, FAA Facilities, federally-funded organizations, and companies.	The Boeing Corporation is under contract with the FAA to assist NASA GRC in the identification of simulation, emulation, and demonstration capabilities.  They and other direct contractors of NASA and the FAA for this effort (including but not limited to ITT Industries, Honeywell, Avaliant LLC, and Tectura Corp.) will have access to the information submitted, but only for the specific purpose of helping NASA to develop plans for validating the performance and operational scenarios of integrated communications infrastructure architecture and identification of concepts for demonstrations (in the relevant environment) of the capabilities enabled by the MCNA.	 It is desirable that information provided to describe relevant simulation, emulation and demonstration capabilities relevant to aeronautical mobile communications include: •	A technical description of the simulation, emulation, and demonstration capability including but not limited to: tool name, vendor, capability description, hardware supported, and operating system. •	Description of existing application(s) of the tool to support simulation, emulation, and demonstration for the purposes of validating concepts, strategies, and/or technologies in the context of an air traffic management (ATM) environment (in particular the National Airspace System – NAS) and/or aeronautical network enabled environment.  This would include descriptions of specific ATM/NAS related models, some discussion/details of how they have been used, and a brief history of the process and for what purpose they were developed.  Sample outputs, screenshots, and other graphical samples would be useful. •	A description of the level of fidelity of the tool/capability with regards to the actual ATM/NAS and/or NEO related system(s) it simulates, emulates, or demonstrates, and whether or not and how the tool/capability has been validated by the FAA, NASA, or other recognized authority.  •	Availability of the tool to support future aeronautical MCNA design and development. •	Technical maturity of the simulation, emulation and demonstration capability and areas/timeframe for planned upgrades and improvements.  For the purposes of providing clarity in the scope of responses desired, the following list of examples is included.  These examples are intended to be representative of the types of capabilities solicited in the RFI and are not fully inclusive. o	Modeling (software simulation and representation of MCNA or various aspects) o	Modeling tools for evaluating:  &#61607;	Network and datalink protocol performance and interactions &#61607;	PHY performance in multipath, mobile environment &#61607;	Communication system capacity estimation &#61607;	Spectrum utilization and optimization … o	Models previously developed to represent aeronautical communications such as:  &#61607;	VDLm(A,2,3,4,E), UAT, Inmarsat Aero-H, Swift-64, Swift-BGAN, 802.X, P25, P34, 3G, 1090ES, HFDL, VDL-B, B-VHF, ADL &#61607;	Network protocols applicable to MCNA such as (ATN, CPDLC, MIPv6, NeMo, SCTP…)  &#61607;	Datalink message sets and applications such as (CPDLC, CM, ADS, FIS…) o	Emulation & Demonstration (Laboratory experiments including hardware in the loop testing eventually leading to flight demonstrations) o	Wireless and SatCom link emulation o	Avionics system emulation (CMU, FMC, VHF, HF, SatCom, MCDU …) o	Ground system emulation (DSP functions, FANS/ATN gateways …) o	Ground ATM application emulation (ATOP, URET, STARS, CTAS …)  o	Existing testbeds o	Aviation platforms designed for test and experimentation Submittal Instructions: 1.

<SUBJECT>B--AERONAUTICAL MOBILE COMMUNICATION NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (MCNA) SIMULATION, EMULATION AND DEMONSTRATION CAPABILITIES
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICIATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. In responding to this notice, please refer to “Aeronautical Mobile Communication Network Architecture (MCNA) Simulation, Emulation and Demonstration Capabilities.” Send information/literature/qualification statement no later than February 17, 2005 to the e-mail or postal address as provided herein.  NASA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to provide information relative to the goals set forth below. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about existing and near-future, high fidelity simulation, emulation and demonstration capabilities to support the validation of proposed concepts and enabling technologies for an aeronautical Mobile Communication Network Architecture (MCNA).  The MCNA encompasses the mobile digital voice and data communication capabilities required to support communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) services for future Air Traffic Management (ATM) operations.  A clearly defined MCNA is a key element for transformation of the National Airspace System (NAS) towards Network Enabled Operations (NEO). The MCNA extends voice and data information services defined in the NAS System Wide Information Management (SWIM) concept to all mobile elements of the NAS, including aircraft during all phases of flight.  Transition to this future MCNA would begin in the 2009 – 2015 time period, and the useful life of the system should be at least 20 to 30 years.   The information received in response to this RFI will be used by NASA GRC in support of a collaborative MCNA Study with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (as part of the Global Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance System (GCNSS) Phase II contract with the Air Traffic Management Division of Boeing Corporation).  The FAA/NASA GRC MCNA Study will help to define MCNA requirements and evaluate them against existing and planned communications capabilities in the NAS to identify gaps and/or inconsistencies that must be addressed either through the enhancement of current systems and capabilities or the development of new MCNA systems. The study includes the evaluation of the requirements, architecture and associated transition plans.   NASA GRC responsibilities include the identification of U.S. national capabilities needed to validate the 2015 mobile communications network architecture for use in NEO and SWIM.  This RFI is intended to provide input for conducting Task 2.5: Simulation, Emulations, Demonstrations, where candidate simulation models and tools and emulation environments are required to validate proposed MCNA concepts, strategies and enabling technologies.  This includes identification of unique facilities and capabilities that exist or are planned within the U.S. at NASA Centers, FAA Facilities, federally-funded organizations, and companies.	The Boeing Corporation is under contract with the FAA to assist NASA GRC in the identification of simulation, emulation, and demonstration capabilities.  They and other direct contractors of NASA and the FAA for this effort (including but not limited to ITT Industries, Honeywell, Avaliant LLC, and Tectura Corp.) will have access to the information submitted, but only for the specific purpose of helping NASA to develop plans for validating the performance and operational scenarios of integrated communications infrastructure architecture and identification of concepts for demonstrations (in the relevant environment) of the capabilities enabled by the MCNA.	 It is desirable that information provided to describe relevant simulation, emulation and demonstration capabilities relevant to aeronautical mobile communications include: •	A technical description of the simulation, emulation, and demonstration capability including but not limited to: tool name, vendor, capability description, hardware supported, and operating system. •	Description of existing application(s) of the tool to support simulation, emulation, and demonstration for the purposes of validating concepts, strategies, and/or technologies in the context of an air traffic management (ATM) environment (in particular the National Airspace System – NAS) and/or aeronautical network enabled environment.  This would include descriptions of specific ATM/NAS related models, some discussion/details of how they have been used, and a brief history of the process and for what purpose they were developed.  Sample outputs, screenshots, and other graphical samples would be useful. •	A description of the level of fidelity of the tool/capability with regards to the actual ATM/NAS and/or NEO related system(s) it simulates, emulates, or demonstrates, and whether or not and how the tool/capability has been validated by the FAA, NASA, or other recognized authority.  •	Availability of the tool to support future aeronautical MCNA design and development. •	Technical maturity of the simulation, emulation and demonstration capability and areas/timeframe for planned upgrades and improvements.  For the purposes of providing clarity in the scope of responses desired, the following list of examples is included.  These examples are intended to be representative of the types of capabilities solicited in the RFI and are not fully inclusive. o	Modeling (software simulation and representation of MCNA or various aspects) o	Modeling tools for evaluating:  &#61607;	Network and datalink protocol performance and interactions &#61607;	PHY performance in multipath, mobile environment &#61607;	Communication system capacity estimation &#61607;	Spectrum utilization and optimization … o	Models previously developed to represent aeronautical communications such as:  &#61607;	VDLm(A,2,3,4,E), UAT, Inmarsat Aero-H, Swift-64, Swift-BGAN, 802.X, P25, P34, 3G, 1090ES, HFDL, VDL-B, B-VHF, ADL &#61607;	Network protocols applicable to MCNA such as (ATN, CPDLC, MIPv6, NeMo, SCTP…)  &#61607;	Datalink message sets and applications such as (CPDLC, CM, ADS, FIS…) o	Emulation & Demonstration (Laboratory experiments including hardware in the loop testing eventually leading to flight demonstrations) o	Wireless and SatCom link emulation o	Avionics system emulation (CMU, FMC, VHF, HF, SatCom, MCDU …) o	Ground system emulation (DSP functions, FANS/ATN gateways …) o	Ground ATM application emulation (ATOP, URET, STARS, CTAS …)  o	Existing testbeds o	Aviation platforms designed for test and experimentation Submittal Instructions: 1.

<SUBJECT>D -- Streamlined Public-Private Competition for Information Technology Technical Services by the Administration Office, Office of Management and Budget
<DESC>This notice constitutes OMB’s formal announcement of a streamlined public-private competition involving information technology (IT) technical services performed by its Administration Office (AO).  Through this competition, OMB will determine whether it is more cost-effective to continue having these services performed by government personnel or to instead have the work provided by the private sector.  The activities to be studied include desktop and network printer services, server support, and other technical services to assist OMB’s IT Manager.  These activities fall within function code W826 (systems design, development and programming services) on OMB’s Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act inventory.  (OMB’s inventory of commercial activities is small – i.e., under 20 FTEs according to the 2003 inventory.) The manpower currently used to provide these activities is approximately 1.4 FTEs.  The work is performed by employees at the GS-14 grade level in the 2210 Computer Specialist job series.

In accordance with OMB Circular A-76, the cost of performance with government personnel will be compared to the cost of performance by the private sector to determine which sector is more cost-effective.  The cost of government performance will be evaluated based on the AO’s current organizational structure.  The cost of private sector performance will be determined based on market research conducted by the Federal Technology Service (FTS) of the General Services Administration on OMB’s behalf.  Costs will be documented on the streamlined competition form (SLCF) prescribed by the Circular.  This form ensures that federal agencies compare the cost of public and private sector performance using a standardized costing methodology.  

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract and a formal request for quotes or solicitation will not be issued as part of this competition.  However, if the analysis reveals that the private sector is the more cost-effective source, OMB intends to acquire the services from the private sector. 

A performance decision will be publicly announced not later than 90 days after the date of this announcement.  This will be the only notice prior to the announcement of the performance decision.  The SLCF will be posted on FedBizOpps.
 
OMB’s Competitive Sourcing Official is Mr. Robert A. Burton.  The Agency Tender Official is Ms. Lauren Wright.  The Contracting Officer is Ms. Lesa Scott, FTS.  Questions should be directed to the point of contact.

<DESC>Privatization of Gas Distribution, Water and Wastewater Utility Systems at Fort Bragg, NC

Description

The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of Gas Distribution, Water and Wastewater Utility Systems at Fort Bragg, NC.
Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement. As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement. The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale. The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

OVERVIEW
The Fort Bragg/Pope Air Force Base complex is not a typical DoD installation. First it is a very large complex, encompassing over 160,000 acres. It is true that much of this area consists of range area with minimal utilities, but it still remains an exceptionally large installation. Perhaps the most important distinguishing characteristic is the dynamic nature of the complex, particularly on Fort Bragg and satellite Camp MacKall. The missions of this Installation, described in subsequent paragraphs, have been receiving priority funding for the past several years and that trend is projected to continue for the foreseeable future. Robust MILCON and OMA funding have transformed and will continue to radically change the real property facilities and infrastructure of Fort Bragg. This ongoing massive construction program obviously drives changes to Fort Bragg’s utility infrastructure. Generally, the new system owner must be flexible and willing to make necessary adjustments to keep pace with Fort Bragg changes. Another important general requirement is that the new owner must be able to “spin up” very quickly; a slow-paced transition will not be possible.

Fort Bragg is located in the Sandhills Region of the south-central portion of North Carolina, 10 miles northwest of downtown Fayetteville and 90 miles northwest of the Atlantic Ocean. The nearest neighboring major cities include Raleigh, 50 miles to the northeast; Charlotte, 100 miles to the west; and Columbia, South Carolina, 142 miles to the southwest. The Cape Fear River is six miles to the east and Interstate 95 is approximately 12 miles southeast of the Cantonment. The northern boundary of the Cantonment borders Pope Air Force Base. Fort Bragg’s reservation extends across portions of four North Carolina counties: Cumberland, Hoke, Moore and Harnett. The Cantonment is located in Cumberland County, while the Range and Training Area is located primarily in Hoke, Moore and Harnett counties. Camp MacKall, consisting of an airfield and training areas on 7,917 acres, is located approximately 6.6 miles (30 miles from the Cantonment area) west of Fort Bragg in Moore, Richmond and Scotland counties.
The Cantonment is the urbanized portion of Fort Bragg. The primary routes to Fort Bragg from Fayetteville include the All American Freeway, Bragg Boulevard (Route 24/87) and Murchison Road (Route 210/87). Bordering the Cantonment to the west and south is the crescent-shaped Greenbelt, a forested area that supplies habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker, a federally-listed endangered species. Fort Bragg has 13 named family housing neighborhoods consisting of more than 4,700 homes located throughout the Cantonment. In the center of the Cantonment is the Old Post Historic District, a planned environment of buildings, roads and open spaces characterized by the formal geometry of the Beaux Arts style of urban design. Fort Bragg’s real property inventory reflects more than 4,900 buildings that provide more than 29 million square feet of space.
Pope Air Force Base, located on the north side of Fort Bragg, is integrally associated with Fort Bragg. Pope AFB has 580 buildings encompassing approximately 3.3 million square feet of space. Though Pope covers 2,157 acres, only 263 acres are fee-owned by the Air Force. The remaining 1,894 acres are actually owned by Fort Bragg and permitted to the Air Force. Pertinent planning criteria associated with Pope AFB will be discussed in subsequent paragraphs. There will be no effort to segregate or separately identify these Pope AFB utility components from Fort Bragg’s. All utility components included in the package should be considered Fort Bragg assets.
Satellite Locations:
Extraterritorial Lands
Although its land area encompasses more than 250 square miles, Fort Bragg cannot accommodate within its boundaries all of the training required by its assigned units. As a result, training frequently is conducted on extraterritorial lands, which are public and private lands located off the Installation proper. These lands total approximately 1.3 million acres. There are no utility components to be considered for privatization on these extraterritorial lands.
Fort Bragg Housing
In May 2002, the Army selected Picerne Military Housing, LLC (Picerne) to privatize the family housing estate at Fort Bragg. As Fort Bragg’s selected partner, Picerne manages all family housing neighborhoods for the duration of a 50-year lease. Prior to commencing the partnership, Picerne and Fort Bragg staff prepared the Post’s Community Development and Management Plan (CDMP). Picerne has projected that all construction in the initial phase of reconstruction will be completed by 2013. The second and third phases of reconstruction will take place during the ensuing 40 years of the lease. 
The Army/Picerne Partnership was formally established through the corporate entity, “Bragg Communities, LLC.” Bragg Communities, LLC took over the housing estate on 1 August 2003. The initiative privatized 4,746 family housing units. The project includes the demolition of 1,568 existing homes and construction of 2,652 new homes. The remaining inventory of 2,928 dwelling units, which includes 209 historic homes, will be renovated and maintained as needed. At the end of the 10-year development period (Phase I), the inventory will be 5,578 units. The privatization eliminates 1,526 inadequate units and a deficit of 834 four-bedroom units.
Three new neighborhoods will be developed in the northern portion of Northern Training Area IV (NTA IV). The RCI parcel consists of approximately 1,064 acres of mostly wooded land located adjacent to North Carolina Highway 24/87. A total of 1,538 new homes will be constructed. 
The housing privatization contractor, Bragg Communities, LLC will construct the natural gas distribution system which will serve new family housing construction on the Installation. Bragg Communities, LLC will connect this new natural gas distribution system to the existing Fort Bragg natural gas system. All of this construction and tie-in to the existing Fort Bragg distribution system will be at the expense of Bragg Communities, LLC. Bragg Communities, LLC will construct this distribution system to accepted utility standards. At the completion of construction, Bragg Communities, LLC, will convey the newly constructed distribution system to the appropriate natural gas system privatization contractor for ownership, operation and maintenance, and repair consistent with points of demarcation described in RFP.
Army family housing utility mains and service laterals generally have been retained by the Government and are, therefore, part of the UP package. Points of demarcation are covered in subsequent paragraphs for both utility components privatized under the RCI process and those retained by the Government which are included in the privatization package
Pope AFB Housing
Pope AFB has its own family housing complex with a total of 627 dwelling units. Unlike Fort Bragg, Pope AFB has no current plans to privatize the housing complex which is currently under a contractor-performed maintenance contract. Utility mains and laterals are included in the overall UP package and points of demarcation will be as described in RFP

Gas Distribution System Description
The system may include, but is not limited to, regulating stations, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be conveyed to the Contractor using the Bill of Sale (sample shown in RFP) at the time the system is transferred. 
System Description
Natural gas is delivered by NCNG to Fort Bragg via a 12-inch main at a location behind the Knox Street warehouses. Pope AFB obtains its natural gas through Fort Bragg. The 12-inch main operates at 150 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). This pressure is regulated down to 25 psi at 32 separate delivery points that serve various areas.
The majority of the distribution system components located within Fort Bragg are owned by the Government and operated by Fort Bragg personnel. There are sections of pipe owned and operated by NCNG and Honeywell. NCNG owns, operates and maintains the gas line from the delivery point (behind the Knox Street warehouses) north to Longstreet Road, as well as the majority of gas line along Longstreet Road and Reilly Street. Honeywell owns, operates and maintains gas lines that serve the following: Simmons AAF, the Soldier Support Center, Ardennes Street, buildings along 775TH SFG Way, and the H-Area (i.e., Smoke Bomb Hill). Fort Bragg and Honeywell have an existing contract under which Honeywell installs, owns, operates and maintains gas lines and meters for a fixed period (14 years) from the date of installation. Honeywell-owned lines will not transfer to the new owner via privatization until September 2015 or until completion of the contractual period for each portion of the line.

Potable Water System Description

The Fort Bragg potable water system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to on-base wells, pumping stations, water treatment and distribution components and, for off-base sources, the distribution system. The system includes, but is not limited to, pumps, water treatment components, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, post indicating valves, storage facilities, backflow prevention devices, and meters. This water treatment and distribution system privatization package also includes the Pope AFB water system and the water system at Camp MacKall.
All water rights (pumping or purchased) will remain with the Government.
Specifically excluded from the water treatment and distribution system privatization package:
&#61656;	Non-potable fire protection system, including deluge tanks, pipe, pumps, altitude valves, etc.
&#61656;	Irrigation systems
&#61656;	Swimming pool facilities
&#61656;	Range water wells and small system-dedicated wells
&#61656;	Wash Rack Facility
System Description
This section describes the water systems at Fort Bragg, Pope AFB and Camp MacKall. Fort Bragg has a standby potable water purchase agreement with the City of Fayetteville and is connected to the City’s 16-inch water main at the intersection of Gruber and Murchison Roads.
FORT BRAGG WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM
Raw Water
Fort Bragg is located within the boundaries of the Cape Fear River Basin. Raw water is withdrawn from the Little River, which flows eastward along the northern boundary of the Installation. The state of North Carolina classifies the water source as surface water. The Little River is a tributary of the Cape Fear River and has an estimated safe yield of 16 million gallons per day (MGD). Flow in the Little River primarily originates from Crystal Lake and the James River. Fort Bragg owns 25 miles upstream of its withdrawal point and owns nearly the entire watershed except a few tributaries. The watershed consists of approximately 326,000 acres of sandy long-leaf pine forests.
Two raw water intakes can be utilized to withdraw water from the Little River. The primary intake is located adjacent to the raw water pumping station. A secondary intake is located one mile upstream from which water flows by gravity through a 30-inch pipeline to the raw water pumping station (when the 30-inch valve is open). A small dam diverts flow from the river through a traveling mesh screen and then into the wet well located underneath the pump house. The raw water pumping station located on Little River’s south bank houses a traveling screen assembly and raw water pumps.
There are 10 pumps which move water from the wet well to the facility headworks through two 16-inch transmission lines which combine into one 20-inch pipeline. The pump types and rated capacities are listed in the following table. The pumps are of varying capacity ranging from 1,000 to 4,900 gallons per minute (GPM) with a total rated capacity of 30,400 GPM or 43.8 MGD. A diesel-powered backup pump is also available which is rated at 5,600 GPM (8.1 MGD). The electric raw water pumps withdraw water through intake lines submerged into the wet well at a depth of one foot from the bottom. Damage has occurred to these pumps in the past due to inoperable travel screen and the accumulation of sand and debris in the wet well, and also from drought conditions experienced in the Summer of 2002.
The Fort Bragg Water Treatment Plant has a rated treatment capacity of 10.6 MGD. Calculated on a monthly basis between Jan 2002 and Dec 2002, actual daily production varied from a low of 3.34 MGD during the winter to a high of 13.27 MGD during the summer. Instantaneous operating flow (i.e., not sustained over an entire day) was 16.0 MGD. Average daily consumption, again calculated on a monthly basis, ranged from 5 MGD during the winter to 9 MGD during the summer.
Distribution System 
The high service pumps move water from the treatment facility into the treated water distribution system. The distribution system was originally constructed in 1918. The current system is comprised of approximately 370 miles of pipe and associated appurtenances serving about 5,200 service connections. The water service mains range in size from 2-inch to 24-inch diameter pipe. Distribution system pipe material includes asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic. There are no known lead lines. The system operates on two pressure zones with pressure reducing valves on the four interconnections between the high and low service areas. Distribution system pressures are adequate ranging from 50-110 psi with most of the installation at a pressure of about 75-psi. There is no cathodic protection system for the metal water pipes. A Drinking Water Study in progress at Pope AFB has identified pressures as high as 150 psi in hydrants on the industrial side of the Base (the closest points to the FBWTP); normal pressures recorded in the industrial side during this study were in the range of 95 to 130 psi. In the housing areas, the hydrant pressures ranged from 75 to 103 psi.
The distribution system has six potable water storage facilities not considering the clearwells. The combined water storage volume is 4.75 million gallons. There are two tanks at Simmons AAF for fire suppression tanks (total storage volume of 0.376 million gallons), excluded from the water system privatization package. The Old and New Division tanks, SOCOM tank, and Tank Hill standpipe all serve the high-pressure zone of the distribution system. Level transmission signals from Main Post, New Division, Old Division, COSCOM, Tank Hill, and SOCOM are transmitted via radio signal to a chart recorder and SCADA in the control room at the water treatment facility. 
Booster Pumping Stations
There are seven booster pumping stations within the water system.. Each pump has a rated capacity of 1,750 gpm for a combined capacity of 5,250 gpm. 
Supplemental Source of Potable Water
The Fort Bragg potable water system was connected to a 16-inch Fayetteville municipal water main at Murchison Road and Gruber Road in 1982.
CAMP MACKALL
Camp MacKall water system is an independent system and is supplied with metered potable water by the City of Southern Pines. Potable water is supplied through an 8-inch water main from the water treatment plant in Southern Pines. The Southern Pines water treatment plant is located near the intersection of Route 1 and Thunder Road, approximately two miles north of the Rowe Training Facility. Potable water from the water treatment plant is supplied through an 8-inch water main along Route 1, which then connects to an 8-inch water main along Special Forces Way. The Army owns the 8-inch water line that is approximately 3 miles long. The point of demarcation between the City of Southern Pines and the U.S. Army is where the 8-inch water line connects with the 8-inch water main that leaves the water plant. A network of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cast iron and galvanized steel mains distribute potable water around the RTF. According to Fire Department personnel, the water distribution network has adequate water pressure for fire protection, but does not produce the required fire flow of 1,000 gallons per minute. The Camp MacKall water system consists of approximately 26,000 feet of water mains ranging from less than 4” to 8”, five main valves, and 3 fire hydrants. 
Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Description

The Fort Bragg wastewater system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system as defined by the points of demarcation beginning at the connection to the treatment provider and ending at each end use facility. The system may include, but is not limited to, sewage mains, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be conveyed to the Contractor using the Bill of Sale shown in RFP at the time the system is transferred. 
If the Contractor proposes to use an alternative source of wastewater treatment, the proposal shall include provisions for demolition of the existing plant.
System Description
The wastewater system consists of pumping stations, mains, laterals, valves, ejector pumps, and a treatment plant. Specifically excluded from privatization of the wastewater collection and treatment system are:
&#61656;	Storm water systems
&#61656;	Oil/water separators, except those integral to the lift stations
&#61656;	Grease traps
&#61656;	Septic tank systems
&#61656;	Centralized vehicle wash facility and the associated pond
&#61656;	Camp MacKall: The lift station and force main that is owned and operated by Moore Water and Sewer Authority.
FORT BRAGG WASTEWATER SYSTEM
The wastewater system at Fort Bragg includes service laterals, manholes, collection mains, lift stations, force mains, and a treatment plant. The wastewater collection system located inside the fence of Pope AFB is included in this privatization action. Most of Fort Bragg’s existing wastewater collection pipes are constructed of vitrified clay, concrete, or reinforced concrete. Minor quantities of PVC and acrylonitrile butadine styrene plastic pipe also are used. The force mains are constructed primarily of ductile iron, cast iron or asbestos cement. Minor quantities of PVC and ABS also are used in the force mains. There are various small lift stations or ejector pumps, and eleven major lift stations. All the major lift stations have emergency power and are monitored at the wastewater treatment plant, Utilities Distribution, Environment Compliance Branch, and Pope AFB Operations by telemetry SCADA.
The collection system handles domestic and some minimal non-domestic wastewater. Non-domestic wastewater is generated in fabrication shops, repair shops, overhaul shops, depot facilities, printing shops, food services and medical services. Industrial wastewater is discharged to the sanitary sewer system. Vehicle maintenance and refueling areas are equipped with oil/water separators, which are the only means used to pre-treat industrial wastewater. The current treatment facilities are able to adequately treat industrial wastewater with respect to NPDES permit limits. Wastewater flows generally in a northerly direction to Fort Bragg Wastewater Treatment Plant, including 11 major lift stations
FORT BRAGG WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
Fort Bragg Wastewater Treatment Plant (FBWWTP) treats domestic and a portion of non-domestic wastewater. Industrial flows (motor pools, replate shop, hospital, medical clinics, dental clinics, on-post laundry, wash racks) are estimated by post personnel as accounting for five to ten percent of the average daily flow recorded at the wastewater treatment plant. The FBWWTP is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Wastewater is treated in an activated sludge, extended aeration and secondary treatment system (clarifiers only). The wastewater treatment plant was constructed in 1941, upgraded in 1981, and rebuilt in 1991. The current plant was designed with a capacity of 8 million gallons per day (mgd) with a maximum hydraulic capacity of 13 mgd. The average daily flow is 5 mgd during dry weather; however, during wet weather flows near its maximum hydraulic capacity have been recorded. The North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources conducted a study in 2000 that concluded the plant was at 68 percent capacity. The plant’s NPDES permit (No. NC0003964, Outfall 001), limits the daily maximum and monthly average concentrations of specified pollutants.
WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT OPERATION
GENERAL DESCRIPTION/CONSIDERATIONS
The WWTP receives mostly domestic sewage and some non-domestic flow from vehicle and aircraft maintenance and washing facilities, and photography, x-ray, medical, and dining facilities.
The following permits are in existence at this time:
•	NPDES at WWTP (NC2300647)
•	Sludge Production and Disposal (WQ001965)
•	WW Collection System and Lift Stations (WQS00029)
Influent entering the WWTP receives preliminary treatment consisting of a mechanically cleaned bar screen, followed by a vortex grit chamber. The flow from this chamber is split and sent to two parallel, semi-circular oxidation ditches for extended aeration. Secondary treatment is continued in clarifiers, which provide sludge-liquid separation. Secondary effluent disinfection by chlorine gas is provided in secondary clarifiers (Solid Waste Management Unit (SWMU) 42, FTBR-042) and inoperable ultraviolet disinfection tanks (Chlorine Contact Tank (SWMU 44, FTBR-044). De-chlorination of final effluent is enhanced by stepped cascade (SWMU 46, FTBR-046) aeration prior to discharge into the Lower Little River.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address potential offerors questions.

Question 1:	What is the apparent temperature difference between the background and the plume?

Answer to Question 1: The exhaust plumes are typically 2000-3000K, i.e. an order of magnitude above the background.

Question 2:	Do you need to see the background imagery around the plume or is it satisfactory to present an image of the plume against a dark background?  

Answer to Question 2:	Resolution of the background imagery around the plume is required, since the purpose of the camera is to get an "eyes on" view of the point of origin (POO).
