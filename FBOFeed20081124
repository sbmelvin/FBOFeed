To register in CCR, you may use one of the following methods: (a) call telephone number 1-888-CCR-2423 for further information. (b) Input directly to CCR through the interactive World Wide Web at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/scripts/index.html. Contractors shall be registered in CCR in order to be considered eligiblefor any Federal award.</p>

<DESC><p>The Global Systems Positioning (GPS) Wing will release Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 for the Advanced GPS Control Segment (OCX) on 19 January 2009. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time. GPS is an Acquisition Category 1D program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1 and 2. Block 1 will replace existing legacy GPS command and control system and allow for use of the modernized capabilities (L2C, L5, M-Code) currently on or planned to be on orbit. In addition to Block 1 capabilities, Block 2 will integrate GPS IIIA capabilities into the baseline and ensure availability of OCX to be synchronized to support launch, TT&amp;C, on-orbit checkout and operations of the first GPS IIIA satellite.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001. Offerors will be given 37 days from release of RFP to deliver their proposals. Potential Offerors who believe they are technically capable but were not awarded a Phase A contract shall submit a statement of capability within 10 days of the posting of this announcement. Potential Offerors shall indicate whether they are a large or small business and their interest as a prime or subcontractor.</p>
<p>No further notices for this solicitation will be posted. The GPSW will communicate directly with responsible prime contractors deemed capable to provide responsive proposals.</p>

<SUBJECT>Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center Traffic Management Solutions
<SOLNBR>AG-0109-S-09-0002
<CONTACT>Della K. Koelling, Phone 907-586-8852, Email dkoelling@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The Tongass National Forest (TNF) contemplates releasing a request for firm-fixed-price proposals on or after December 9, 2008, via this FedBizOpps website for a traffic management solution for the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center (MGVC) in Juneau, Alaska, with proposals due on or after January 12, 2008.  Specifically, the TNF is seeking a real-time intelligent transportation or traffic system (ITS) to let tour bus drivers know in advance if there is a space for their vehicle in the bus loading zone or if they need to queue in a nearby uncongested interceptor lot, and then provide instructions to the drivers when to approach the loading zone.

The original traffic design at the MGVC provides space for up to 5 buses to occupy the bus loading zone in the teardrop shaped cul-de-sac near the Visitor Center entrance (see Attachment 1, Project Site Map).  The current and projected volume of bus traffic is too great for unregulated use of this area.  One contributor to congestion is the queue formed by buses waiting for a curbside slot to load or unload their passengers.  More permanent improvements are needed to actively and efficiently manage vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  Such improvements should carry the needs of the Visitor Center for approximately fifteen to twenty year time period.  As mentioned above, the TNFs goal is an ITS to let bus drivers know well in advance if there is a space for their vehicle or if they need to queue in an uncongested interceptor lot.  Alternative Transportation in Parks and Public Lands (ATPPL) funds have been awarded to the TNF to install a real-time ITS to regulate the arrivals of buses to drop-off or pick up passengers, depending on available slots and improve way-finding for pedestrians.

The US Department of Transportations Volpe Center provided an analysis and published the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center Congestion Study.  This study is the foundation on which the funds from the ATPPL program and the contemplated request for proposals, and will be an attachment to the request for proposals.  Traffic counts for the area will also be provided.  No specific ITS approach has been decided upon, and offerors will be invited to propose any feasible technology solution which will satisfy the TNFs need for a traffic management solution.  

The ATPPL funds available are $500,000.  The request for proposals will seek firm-fixed-priced proposals not exceeding this amount.  The TNF shares this figure to help offerors properly scope their proposals for the installation of an ITS at the MGVC, including any necessary planning or design work.

A pre-solicitation conference is scheduled for Monday, December 8, 2008 at 2:00pm Alaska Standard Time.  This is planned as a call-in conference only; the conference call number is 907-586-8720.  

This acquisition is contemplated as full and open competition.  Prospective offerors are invited to identify themselves to the contracting officer with information on their size status, capabilities, and interest in this project, by Thursday, December 4, 2008.  Prospective offerors are also invited to prepare brief white papers by Thursday, December 4, 2008, describing factors that the TNF should consider as it formalizes its request for proposals, including suggestions on the method of the acquisition, evaluation criteria, scope of the project, timelines, the appropriateness of the above classification and NAICS codes, and so forth.  The TNF may use this information to validate or modify its acquisition approach.

In order to receive any contract award, vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  To register in the CCR system, go to: http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.  To register in the ORCA system, go to: http://www.bpn.gov.

<SUBJECT>Islet Cell Distribution coordination Center
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIDDK-08-99SB
<RESPDATE>012809
<CONTACT>Sally Boakye, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email boakyes@mail.nih.gov - Ed Kostolansky, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-594-4758, Fax 301-480-4226, Email Edward.Kostolansky@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) will solicit proposals for a coordinating center for the distribution of human cadaveric islets for laboratory research. This procurement will support a single coordinating center that subcontracts to qualified islet isolation facilities to prepare and distribute human islets for investigational research. The coordinating center will maintain a roster of investigators approved to receive islets and will assume responsibility to notify investigators and distribute islets when they are available. Contract funds will provide partial cost recovery to islet isolation facilities for islets distributed and investigators that receive them will have cost sharing charges for the islets received.
<p>The resultant contract will be a Cost- Reimbursement Contract under Full and Open Competitive Procedures.</p>
<p>Currently, the National Institutes of Health and NIDDK support a multi-facetted research program to further the development of islet transplantation as a viable therapy including clinical trials, preclinical studies in animal models, fundamental research, and provision of resources to supplement these efforts. This support includes investigator initiated research projects and consortia funded through cooperative agreements and contracts. Of relevance to this notice, the Islet Cell Resource (ICR) program is currently comprised of an interactive consortium of academic clinical islet isolation facilities and a coordinating center (for more information, visit http://icr.coh.org ). These islet isolation facilities have responsibilities for the procurement of human pancreata, purification and quality control of islet cell preparations, and distribution of viable islets for approved research or clinical protocols. They also perform research and development to improve isolation techniques, cellular viability and function, and shipping conditions. To receive research islets from the ICR, investigators must apply to the Administrative and Bioinformatics Coordinating Center (ABCC). Eligibility requires that investigators either have ongoing, peer reviewed grant funding or have obtained protocol approval by an ICR scientific subcommittee. The ABCC maintains a web-based data collection system that archives detailed information about all phases of islet procurement and a sophisticated algorithm that electronically selects prioritized investigator users to receive islets. In the past five years the ICR has distributed more than 100 million islet equivalents for research studies, and growing needs from the research community are projected. The information gained from fundamental islet research should greatly enhance the current understanding of human islet function and enable transplantation and other therapies for treating diabetes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective of this forthcoming procurement is to establish a successor coordinating center to the ICR in order to continue providing human islet availability following the conclusion of the ICR project period on July 31, 2009. The NIDDK plans to support a contract for islet distribution for laboratory research to accomplish the following objectives in an efficient and cost effective manner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Receive requests for islet applications, qualify investigator recipients, and process these data to maintain a complete and continuously updated electronic roster of approved investigator users and their projected needs. For purposes of this solicitation, the 2008 roster lists 147 investigators who estimate their annual research needs to exceed 30 million IEQ per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Solicit and qualify potential islet production centers with respect to cGMP certification, assure quality performance standards of prepared islets, provide training for standardized distribution protocols, subcontract to appropriate facilities to provide islets for laboratory research, and adjust these subcontracts as warranted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solicitation and Qualification of Islet Production Centers: Islets will be sourced from islet production facilities in two ways. The first method of sourcing will utilize NIH-sponsored clinical islet transplantation trials in North America that include the University of Miami, University of Minnesota, University of Edmonton, University of Pennsylvania, Emory University, University of California at San Francisco, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Northwestern University. These institutions comprise the NIH-funded Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium (CITR) and are in the midst of initiating a series of clinical islet transplantation protocols. Due to the complexities of the islet production process, it is anticipated that only 50% of the isolations attempted will have suitable yield and quality required for clinical use. Islets purified with the intent of clinical use but not used for clinical transplantation, if sufficiently viable, will be salvaged and shipped for research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second source will be from one or more subcontract site. Because the timing and quantity of clinical islet transplantation activity is unpredictable, NIDDK anticipates that islet production will also be solicited from one or more specific site to assure an availability continuum. The process by which subcontracted facilities are selected will be open, subject to independent peer review, and will follow a general announcement. The Contractor, in conjunction with the approval of the NIDDK Project Officer and an External Evaluation Committee, shall design and distribute the announcement and organize the review of candidate facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Develop and maintain an electronic communication system that will monitor and match islet availability from production sites with user requirements and will notify production sites of need for islets and users of availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Develop and maintain financial records of reimbursements to the islet production facilities and receivables, and house the consolidated database of approved islet production facilities and investigators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Maintain accurate records of islet shipments from production sites to islet recipients including quantities and batch release characteristics of islets shipped as assessed by production sites and recipients. Establish subcontracts with commercial carriers for overnight shipping of islets between multiple sites, domestic or international, in accordance with Standard Industry Practice, FDA Requirements, approved Standard Operating Procedures, city, state, and/or Federal regulations, and any special instructions given. Analyze trends in demand for islets and project future requirements for islets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Collect information on performance site islet quality and investigator user satisfaction and analyze these respective data so that processes and quality can be improved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Compile evidence of scientific progress attributable to human islet distribution as shown by publications and other tangible results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Maintain an External Evaluation Committee (EEC) of advisors to guide development and improvement of the resource and support the technical and administrative functions including subcontracts as determined by the Project Officer and External Evaluation Committee. It is anticipated that the EEC will have membership of four to six non-Federal members and will conduct direct meetings at least annually.</p>
<p><br />The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 15- Contract by Negotiation. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html<br />The expected release date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be on or about December 17, 2008 with proposals due January 28, 2009.<br />Organizations interested in responding to the RFP may find the complete RFP posted on the FedBizOpps website. RFP responses must be in writing and must be received by 12:00 EST on February 1, 2009. Email or faxed proposals will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Sally Boakye, Contract Specialist, NLM on 301-496-6546 or Ed Kostolansky, Branch Chief, NLM on 301-594-4758.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to purchase a Fourier Transforming Infra Red (FTIR) spectrophotometer system for the Office of Research and Development/National Health & Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), in RTP, NC.
NHEERL requires a system that will perform simultaneous measurements of two inhalation exposure chambers (a dual system) concentrations of volatile organic compounds, standard emissions from vehicle engines, stack effluents, and standard gases.A.  MINIMUM GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS:  
1.  The system must be able to measure temperature and pressure and transmit that data to allow the operational software to compensate for the effects of both.  The system should have multiple analog inputs/outputs, digital inputs/outputs to allow interfacing between it and other computers or sensors to allow simple communications between each other.  The system should have a digital input to receive a signal from our data acquisition system allowing the spectrophotometer to know which chamber it is sampling.
2.  The system must be designed as an industrial grade system (process type/use) for use in harsh environments.  The interferometers (2) must be of 90 degree Michelson design or modified Michelson design with 0.5 cm(-1) resolution.  The interferometers optics should be in the Mid-IR rang [7000 ? 400 cm(-1)] and may be coated for protection.  The instrument is required to have two (2) ADC?s (analog to digital converters) 20 bit data collection which increases sensitivity.  The interface between the control PC9s) and instrument ADC?s resolution.  The units should run on 110/120 volt 60 Hz power, single phase.
3.   The system control and data acquisition software must allow for unattended operations.  The software should allow the control PC?s to calculate the concentration of the selected compound, selection of various gases and should allow custom calibrations to be done by the operator, as well as Quality Control/Assurance testing. The software should allow batch re-process previously collected data. The data files (spectra) should be compatible with GRAMS/AI software (industry standard) for visualization, quantifying and reporting data from various spectroscopic instruments.   4.  The sampling compartment of each instrument needs to be a gas cell of the ?White Design?, a non-reactive casing, mirrors should be gold coated to allow maximum light throughput and non reactive, a fixed path length of 6 meters to allow the concentration determination of assorted gaseous compounds from ppm to percent (%) levels, be of a volume (approximately 285 milliliters) that will allow the rapid (2 minutes) exchange of compounds at a flow rate of 1.5 liters per minute, the, and be able to withstand temperatures from room temperature (15?C) to 240?C.
5.  The detector module needs to be a ?DGTS? detector to operate at room temperature (12 ? 25 Deg C?) without liquid nitrogen cooling with a minimal spectral range of 400 - 5000 cm-1 wavenumbers. 
6.  Performance criteria lowest detectable limit with 5 minute measurement: NH3 = 0.1 ppm, CO2 = 0.05 ppm, NO2 = 0.05 ppm, SO2 = 1 ppm, Xylene = 0.1 ppm
7.  The data acquisition and instrument control system can be a PC or Laptop.  If a PC it must minimally be:  Intel Pentium 4, 2.5 GHz, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB hard drive, CD-RW drive, integrated graphics controller, keyboard, mouse, 17? SVGA Flat panel monitor.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS). The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group, Brooks City-Base TX is seeking sources for a requirement to acquire coherent, technically consistent, engineering and manufacturing development support that will enhance the survivability of aircrew members through improved performance, maintainability, and availability of the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) family of ejection seat aircraft (A-10, B-1, B-2, F-15, F-16 and F-22) without aircraft modification.
<p>The principal goals of this effort are to develop and qualify modification improvements that will keep pace with aircraft operational mission requirements, and address aircrew safety issues associated with high-speed/high altitude operating environments. Additionally, this effort will allow for an increase in ejection seat capability to support an expanded anthropometric aircrew range, extended ejection envelope for altitude and speed, and an improved maintainability capability that significantly reduces ejection seat maintenance downtime, resulting in increased aircraft operational availability. The respondent will develop, design, and build prototypes test articles that will demonstrate that a field-level modification can be retrofitted to existing ACES ejection seat aircraft without aircraft modification. The respondent shall furnish all plant facilities, labor, equipment, special tools, test equipment, and materials. Government drawings, tooling, and facilities to manufacture these kits are not available.</p>
<p>The resulting contract will cover all engineering, manufacturing, qualification testing on applicable sub-systems, integration, and any necessary development testing associated with improving the operation and maintenance of the ACES ejection seat. This will be accomplished by incorporating controllable propulsion subsystems to optimize terrain clearance during the ejection sequence, upgrading ejection seat sequencing and sensing subsystems for safer/faster/more reliable operation, and allowing the ejection seat to be removed from its crew station without the requirement to remove the aircraft canopy/hatch, which will significantly increase aircraft availability. Additionally, this contract will address improving the ability to eliminate/mitigate limb flailing during high-speed ejection, and optimizing aircrew accommodation improvements for better access to aircraft controls and improved body position for aircraft operation and ejection. This contract will cover all engineering and manufacturing efforts required in support of trade studies, preliminary designs, final designs, and design verification to determine the merits of the services described above.</p>
<p>Formal responses to this SSS should also detail the experience, capabilities, and rights to proprietary drawings, as briefly outlined above, to the Government. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR ANY ITEMS/SERVICES FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. PLEASE NOTE THAT TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.</p>

<DESC>DRAFT RFINASA DFRC, in support of the Agencys human spaceflight programs would like to increasethe Agencys non-critical measurement data per pound and, based on previous programexperiences, improve the flexibility to upgrade, add to or modify instrumentationsystems. NASA intends to become better aware of emerging technologies and architecturesfor human space vehicle flight test and instrumentation for non-critical purposes.  This RFI is intended to identify Low Mass Modular Development Flight InstrumentationSystems (LMMDS) that can provide the capability to optimize the number and quality ofmeasurements made per flight at a reduced life cycle cost as compared to conventionaldata gathering systems.The LMMDS RFI intends to collect information (public and proprietary) on low mass, highlymodular, non-critical flight data gathering and processing technology that could beintegrated into upcoming development tests as well as the operations of future spacevehicles.Development Flight Instrumentation Systems (DFI), as referred to in this RFI, are systemsintended to collect data which is primarily intended for validation of vehicle systems,environments and operations and models/assessments of them.  DFI data may be relied onfor critical analyses/decisions for future flight tests and missions but will not be useddirectly for critical decisions on the mission they fly on.  DFI systems may also bethought of as precursor/prototype systems and their mission performance a validation ortechnology readiness level step towards the system use in more critical applications. Top-level goals, constraints, assumptions and needs:System Performance Goals:-	Maximize total useable data return for validation of vehicle, environment & ops.       -	Minimize total mass and size required to make non-critical measurements. -	Minimize need for power, active cooling, comm or other vehicle resources.-	Minimize integration and operations, unique mods. installation and checkout.. -	Minimize ground installation/servicing and mission operations required. -	Minimize life-cycle costs compared to conventional measurement systems. -	Maximize measurement system responsiveness, modularity, interoperability.-	Minimize effort to establish RF, EMI and EMC certification for flight. -	Minimize reliance on single vendors by the use of common standards. -	Minimize need for data transfer and vehicle data storage provisions. -	Maximize reliability/probability of obtaining the desired data. -	Minimize impact to vehicle/crew safety, reliability and mission success.Constraints:-	System/components have very wide scope of capability and application, but mustmeet the functional and environmental requirements uniquely specified for the installedlocation and ground/mission operations period of measurement.  For example, missionduration can be of up to 210 days on orbit.-	Systems must accommodate launch date/window changes. As a target, use up to 4delays over a 3 month period without servicing.-	Launch pad operations must be limited to off-vehicle RF communications atscheduled points.-	Installation/checkout must be performed in parallel with critical path vehicleflow.-	System components, elements and sensors must be located where access is availablefor installation/ground turnaround-	Sensors/measurement systems must meet or exceed data user requirements forcalibration, accuracy, resolution, data rates, etc.-	System/measurements restricted to Criticality 3 uses for mission in flow.-	Systems will not require active cooling or cold plate.Assumptions:-	Vehicle will provide a secondary, non-critical bus that provides:-	Standard interfaces for vehicle power (if needed by LMMDS subsystem/components)-	Two-way data/file transfer/interface (as needed for particularmeasurements/operations)-	Interfaces for ground operations/testing-	Physical access to the bus access points for attachment -	Standard physical interfaces will be provided for attachment of severalindependent systems/subsystems at the bus interface points-	Limited opportunity for data storage on the central instrumentation system-     Wireless LAN exists for non-critical applications on vehicle pressurized cabin-     Vehicle will provide necessary data link from expendable to recoverable vehicle sections or else there will be a tie to a down-link on the expendable-	LMMDS will be certified to be Criticality 3-	Safety Approvals will follow the CSERP (Cx Safety & Engineering Review Panel)process.-	Real time Uplink-Downlink is possible, but not without significant justification-	For most applications, nominal operation will not involve real time uplink ordownlink-	Sensors must be approved by the stake-holder organization(s) as adequate,reliable and comparable to standard calibrated sensors-	Measured data may be stored minimize data transfer is optimal to reducecomplexity and error.Satisfying a Wide Range of Needs:The following section is included to convey that NASA is not looking for a one size fitsall system, but rather a suite of compatible systems that range from the very simplestarchitecture to the very sophisticated smart sensors.  It should be noted that we are notlimiting the investigation to those systems containing wireless communications, butrather those that accomplish as many of the Goals within the Constraints and Assumptionslisted. -	Sensor Applications: -	Vehicle systems/structure-	Environments-	Crew/Ops-	Flight Tests/Payloads/possibly experiments -	System Growth:-	Capability to increase the number of sensors or system applications-	Sensor installation interfaces:-	From Non/Velcro to Bond-on/Imbedded-	Sample Rates:-	From very high to very low-	Mission Data transmit needs:-	None to very high (short bursts) -	DAQ Complexity:-	Continuous sample-store to Triggered/Scheduled/Commanded-	Data will have to be recorded either by LMMDS or through interface with vehiclerecording capability -	DAQ Types Supported:-	Passive Tag interrogators to multi-channel systems with synchronization providedby the network of DAQ/Loggers themselves  integrated with or separate from the vehicle-	Sensor type:-	From sensors that could be matured for use in safety critical applications (likeMMOD) to sensors that could support science experiments-	Data Processing/Reduction:-	From none to summary data files to answers at the DAQ-	Data Synchronization:-	Data from LMMDS will be time synchronized as needed-	System life:  -	Ranges from short (e.g. prelaunch/launch events) to long (e.g. contaminationsensing over the life of the vehicle)Technology ObjectivesThis RFI intends to collect information on a variety of applicable technologies, thefollowing list shows some examples of these technologies, but is by no means intended tobe an exhaustive list.	(1)	Micro-size and minimum weight, including connectivity. (2)	Very low power, low maintenance, long-life between servicing.  (3)	Least number of wires/connectors required, including wireless or no connectivity.(4)	Minimum integration and operations to achieve for modularity.(5)	Smart DAQs with User Specifiable calibration, scheduled and even-triggered modes. (6)	Smart DAQs with Processing/Storage allowing reduction of total data transfer. (7)	Robust/Secure Wireless networking and synchronization between DAQs and evenbetween sensor and DAQ.(8)	Plug-and-play wireless interoperability.(9)	Plug-and-play DAQ to avionics integration.(10)	Open architecture standards to promote multiple vendors with competitivesolutions.(11)	Wide variety of data acquisition rates  1 sample per hour to 1 megasample/sec(12)	Robustness with respect to projected environments. (13)	Wide variety of sensor types, including: temperature, dynamic and quasi-staticacceleration, dynamic and static strain, absolute and dynamic pressure, high rateacoustic pressure, calorimeters, dosimeters, radiometers, shock, air flow, varioushand-held sensors etc.	Clarifications:Criticality 3 systems [as defined in CxP 70043, Constellation Program Hardware FailureModes and Effects Analysis and Critical Items List (FMEA/CIL) Methodology]o	System nominal installation/operations do not impact the vehicle, flight crew orground operations safety.o	System failure modes and hazards do not impact the vehicle, flight crew or groundoperations safety, or adequate verifiable controls are in place. o	System sensors and components are designed for nominal operational andnon-operational environments as assessed for their installed locations according to userneeds.o	Systems/sensors do not necessarily need to operate through all flight regimes(e.g., some sensors may only need to operate on ascent, while others may only need tooperate on orbit; etc.)o	Systems do not have to survive off-nominal natural or induced environments suchas hard landings, condensation or lightning strike. o	System/sensor reliability, redundancy and end-to-end quality of service isconsistent with comparable Criticality 3 systems.o	Systems are certified to workmanship standards and parts evaluation results inwarnings and recommendations, not mandated changes unless safety is a concern. Life Cycle Costs include expenses incurred from system connectivity as well as thequantity and complexity of the system.	For example, the cost of cabling must address thedesign and installation costs, as well as the maintenance and operation (mass to space)costs; and the costs associated with limited flexibility to grow (the cost of thecomplexity or difficulty of adding, removing or replacing measurements). Costs to theprogram from not obtaining data are real as well, many of these costs are minimized bymeeting the Goals and Constraints of the system as specified above. This RFI is for information, acquisition and development planning purposes only and isnot to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractualagreement, nor will the Government pay for the information requested. This is NOT a request for proposals or notice of solicitation - no solicitation relatedto this RFI currently exists.

The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. BACKGROUND.  The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain potential solutions to provide a warning system for civilians (particularly in the OIF and OEF theaters) that a military convoy has stopped on the road; and to indicate to civilian drivers that they should immediately stop and take directions from Soldiers on how and when to proceed.  All solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will be considered. <BR><BR>Military convoys are prone to stopping with little or no warning to drivers of other vehicles on the road, particularly in situations where convoys must halt in order for Soldiers to investigate and/or clear hazards such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).  Additionally military vehicles stopped on the road are sometimes less noticeable especially during times of reduced visibility such as during the hours of darkness, during adverse weather conditions (fog, sandstorms, rain, snow); or in areas where a drivers ability to readily see a stopped convoy is hampered by the physical characteristics of the terrain (rounding a blind curve, cresting a hill, etc.).<BR><BR>When convoys are stopped on the road both Soldiers and the civilian population are placed at an increased risk.  While Soldiers are concerned with clearing whatever is impeding their movement they are also concerned with protecting themselves from attack from any number of sources, not the least of which could be in the form of a Vehicle Borne IED (VBIED) traveling toward them from the front or rear of their convoy.  Civilians who are approaching the stopped convoy may mistakenly be seen as a threat and need to be warned to stop and take direction from Soldiers.<BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF and the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem<BR><BR>2. REQUIREMENTS.  The REF is looking for a vehicular-mounted light system that will act as a warning to civilians that a military convoy has stopped on the road; and to indicate to civilian drivers that they should immediately stop and take directions from Soldiers on how and when to proceed.  Key characteristics of the system include the following:<BR><BR>2.1 Use of the system must not place Soldiers in additional harms way; and must be able to be turned on and turned off without the Soldier having to leave his or her vehicle.<BR><BR>2.2 The system must be able to provide warning from at least 300 meters away, day and night.<BR><BR>2.3 The system must not mask or otherwise hinder friendly observation.<BR><BR>2.4 The system must not silhouette friendly positions.<BR><BR>2.5 The system must not negatively impact the effectiveness of friendly communications, or other electronic capabilities.<BR><BR>2.6 The system must be vehicle-powered with an internal battery back-up.  System must be able to operate for a minimum of two (2) hours on internal battery power and optimally for four (4) hours.<BR><BR>2.7 The light signal from the system must not be confused with the muzzle flash from a weapon.<BR><BR>2.8 Optimally the light system should be distinguishable from those used by local law enforcement and emergency services (Police, Fire, Ambulance, etc.).<BR><BR>3. DELIVERABLES.  Specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified in paragraph 2 above.<BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys ability to develop and or provide existing technologies which meet the above requirements and should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed.<BR><BR>The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the contracting officer at gregory.wagenknecht@us.army.mil.  The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.  All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  The government will review RFI submissions as they are received.  The government reserves the right to close this RFI once they have received adequate response(s) to this RFI.<BR><BR>

Defense Supply Center Columbus 

FSCs 5961 and 5962 Qualified Suppliers List of Distributors (QSLD)

This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The proposed Criteria and Provisions for Qualified Suppliers List of Distributors (QSLD) document is applicable to selected Federal Stock Class (FSC) 5961 and 5962 items, where a streamlined acquisition process is desired to improve the quality and services provided to our military customers.  The document has been developed to outline the elements needed to successfully qualify for listing on a Qualified Suppliers List of Distributors (QSLD).  The purpose of the QSLD Program is to establish and maintain a list of pre-qualified distributors that may be used to procure both QML standard parts and/or commercial parts in addition to procuring from the original device manufacturer.  This proposed QSLD listing will pertain only to products that are purchased and managed by the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC).  QSLD products are provided by suppliers that combine accepted commercial practices, quality assurance procedures that are consistent with industry and international quality standards, and tailored when necessary to product unique requirements that can take the place of provisions traditionally stated in DSCC solicitations.


The proposed Criteria and Provisions for Qualified Suppliers List of Distributors (QSLD) document can be found on the following DSCC website with a questionnaire for your input/suggestions/comments:  www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/QSLD.html 

The website will be available on or about November 25, 2008.  Please email the completed questionnaire and any additional questions or comments regarding the proposed program to the following e-mail address:   DSCC.QSLD@dla.mil.


         DISCLAIMER 
     In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis  of  this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.  

            All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.

Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process.
 
Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

           Additional Information:  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by industry responses to this RFI.  If solicitations are released, they will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and posted to the DLA DIBBS website.

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR PURCHASE OF RUN OF MINE SALT FROM THEWASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT NEAR CARLSBAD, NEW MEXICO
<SOLNBR>

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:art.welton@wipp.ws">ARTHUR L WELTON, Contract Officer</a>
<DESC>Washington TRU Solutions LLC (WTS), on behalf of the United StatesDepartmentof Energy (DOE), is seeking expressions of interest from those who wouldwantto purchase salt pursuant to the Materials Act of 1947 in the run of mine(ROM)condition. ROM salt is dry and ranges in size from small boulders to dust.ROMsalt contains about 2.2 percent insoluble material, mainly gypsum, calciteanhydrite and clays. No grading, sizing, or separation is performed and nofacilities currently exist to perform any conventional preparationprocesses.The total ROM salt that will be available over a period of seven years isapproximately 700,000 tons, of which 400,000 tons are available now in anuncovered pile.  When mining is active approximately 8,000 tons would beavailable each month.  There is no contact between Waste Isolation PilotPlant(WIPP) ROM salt extracted to construct the repository and the wastedisposed inthe repository.The ROM salt will be made available as is, where is at a surface locationatthe WIPP site.  Offers will be evaluated on price, purchase schedule, totalvolume required, and method of operation for the removal and transport ofROMsalt from the WIPP site.WIPP is a geological repository designed to permanently dispose oftransuranicradioactive waste left from the research and production of nuclear weapons.Located in southeastern New Mexico, 32 miles southeast of Carlsbad and isaccessible via highways 62-180 that is approximately 12.5 miles to thenorthand highway 128; this is approximately 4.5 south of the facility.  The WIPPProject facilities include disposal rooms excavated in an ancient, stablesaltformation 2,150 feet underground.  Transuranic waste consists of clothing,tools, rags, and other disposable items contaminated with trace amounts ofradioactive elements, including plutonium.This is a request to determine if your firm is interested in receiving aRequest for Proposal (RFP) to purchase this ROM salt. In responding to thisrequest, interested parties are asked to indicate the following:1)  The term or period for which they would be willing to commitcontractuallyto buy WIPP ROM salt,2)  The frequency with which they would expect to take possession of andremoveWIPP ROM salt tendered for delivery by the U.S. Government over thecontractterm,3)  The volume or tonnage that they estimate they would buy and removeduringthe entire sales contract term.4)  Besides providing the above information, interested parties shouldprovidecomments or suggestions that they believe are pertinent to such sales.In order to facilitate the preparation of responses and to provide athoroughunderstanding of physical layout of the ROM salt pile and WIPP facility, apre-solicitation conference will be held on December 8, 2008, from 9:00 amto12:00 pm MDT at the WIPP site.  A member of Procurement will meetrepresentatives of the interested parties at the Guard and Securitybuildingand direct them as appropriate.The pre-solicitation conference will include a walking tour of the currentROMsalt pile, access routes to the ROM salt pile and the nearby rail spur.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A QUOTE.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTES WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Institutes of Health intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis with: Medicus Research LLC, 18250 Roscoe Blvd. Suite 240, CA 91325.  
No solicitation exists for this requirement.  The products are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.  The total contracted dollar amount will not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold; therefore it will be procured under FAR 13.106.  It is believed that Medicus LLC is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR Parts 13.106-1(b) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1:
 Background:
The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) is a congressionally mandated office within the Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) in the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health. The mission of the ODS is to strengthen the knowledge and understanding of dietary supplements by evaluating scientific information, stimulating and supporting - research, disseminating research results, and educating the public to foster an enhanced quality of life and health for the U.S. population.
One of the strategic goals of the ODS is to inform and educate scientists, health care providers, and the public about the benefits and risks of dietary supplements. The ODS works closely with the NIH Institutes and Centers to co-sponsor and co-develop 4-8 conferences and workshops annually for which the ODS assumes significant oversight responsibility for ones that are most aligned with the ODS mission. This typically involves a thorough literature search and review of the proposed topic, nomination of speakers, and coordination of publication materials resulting from these workshops and conferences.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), in collaboration with the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) and other Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), convened a national workshop on January 13-14, 2005, in Bethesda, MD. The goal of the two-day meeting was to gain greater understanding of the complex issues of dietary supplement use by patients receiving anti-thrombotic therapies. Conference participants identified a series of potential research topics and strategies to address these issues, including the need for a systematic review of the clinical literature on dietary constituents and dietary supplements and their effect on blood coagulation.
Statement of Work:
The ODS requires the services of a clinician with experience in conducting systematic reviews of the literature and analysis of the Complementary and Alternative clinical literature to present an evidence-base report on the role, risks, and benefits of dietary constituents and dietary supplements on hemostasis and blood coagulation.
	Provide a critical literature review, current to July 2008, on dietary constituents and dietary supplements that have been identified or purported to affect blood coagulation parameters.
	This would include:
 
(1)	a review of the nutrition science literature to identify dietary components in the diet that have anticoagulant properties;
(2)	a review of literature on human studies to identify dietary supplements that have been shown to have a beneficial and/or harmful effect on blood coagulation parameters; and
(3)	further identify dietary constituents and/or dietary supplements purported to have anticoagulant activity, but lacking sufficient evidence to preclude formulating a recommendation regarding use.
	Review and update data on previously prepared spreadsheet delivered to ODS to include study effect size and dosage/volume of dietary supplement administered.
	Prepare comprehensive review and deliverable with assistance from ODS staff for publication in a peer-review journal based on findings of the updated and revised literature review.
	Consult with the ODS Senior Staff for additional guidance and evaluation of program objectives.
The ODS will provide to the contractor an NIH Library search of the literature on dietary constituents and dietary supplements and anticoagulation and antithrombotic therapies as complied for the January 2005 Conference and updated search through July 2008.
The ODS will also provide to the contractor, as feasible, PDF versions of the articles deemed appropriate for inclusion in the update.
Publication deliverables specified in this contract will be the property of the Office of Dietary Supplements and will not be subject to copyright restrictions under the guidelines of the Federal government.
Contract Period: December 01, 2008  September 30, 2009 
Location of Work: Contractor's place of business



 Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit capability statements to the Contract Specialist by December 01, 2008 at 1PM EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Address responses to the attention of Lloyd Garnes at National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 529V, MSC 7663, Rockville, MD 20852.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541711 with a business size of 500 employees.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER FOR PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS AT THIS TIME. THE DRAFT PLANS (30% AND 60%) are AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW ON OUR WEBSITE (see instructions below). The Government may consider comments and inquiries while preparing the final plans and specs; however, the Government is not seeking comments and may not provide responses to inquiries. A solicitation will be issued on or about the 21 January 2009 with proposals due on or about 21 March 2009.<BR>The purpose of the L-31 North (L-30) Seepage Management Pilot Project (SMPP) is to identify, test, and determine the relative effectiveness of seepage management technologies in order to recommend features to control groundwater flow and levee seepage from Everglades National Park.  Additionally, the project will help determine the constructability of a seepage management barrier to various depths/lengths within the semi-confining unit of the aquifer and may also yield results beneficial to the implementation of the full-scale Everglades National Park Seepage Management Project.  The proposed project is located in Miami-Dade County, north of Tamiami Trail (U.S. Highway 41) and Krome Ave (Route 997).  The L-30 borrow canal and levee mainly runs north-south but makes roughly a 45-degree southwesterly departure from Krome Avenue until it intersects Tamiami Trail, thereby forming what is commonly known as the L-30 triangle.  This 1.25 mile segment of the L-30 Canal, between S-335 and S-334, has been found to be an extremely thick portion of the Biscayne Aquifer with very high measured transmissivity.  A field drawdown test performed as a part of the L-31N SMPP and a Preliminary Seepage Report based on historical data for the area both found the triangle to have the highest seepage rate per mile between S-335 and S-334.   Conceptual Design - The tentatively selected alternative will include the design, installation, and testing of a subsurface seepage management barrier augmented with collection pipes and seepage recovery wells located within the barrier, adjacent to a sheet pile window in the L-30 levee located north of US Highway 41 (Tamiami Trail) between water control structures S-335 and S-336.  The barrier will have dimensions of approximately 80100 feet in depth and approximately 1,0002,200 feet in length.  The selected alternative proposes the placement of a barrier feature using a soil-cement-bentonite (SCB) mix and sheetpile construction technique.  The seepage barriers exact length and depth will be determined using detailed field data, engineering expertise from technical team members, and the A-E contractor. It is anticipated that installation of the seepage barrier through the geologic layers in the project area will be hard limestone may prove difficult, and will most likely require creative engineering techniques for excavating.  This design proposes a SCB slurry wall with a 6 ft. wide  trench.  A 100-ft long shallow sheet pile wall section is proposed as a gap in the slurry wall that will act as a shallow window to direct any desired seepage flow.  During periods of high water flow in the aquifer, seepage flows passing through the window will be captured by the system of wells and pumps.  Wells and pumps will be installed to capture the desired quantity of flow and pump it into the Water Conservation Area 3B as surface water or into adjacent canals.  The pumping system design will allow for the pumps to be controlled locally as well as from a remote location using telemetry.  Flow measurement devices will be installed at the ends and at the mid-point of the barrier.  An approximate 10-ft by 10-ft control building will be required to house electrical controls and panels at the mid-point of the barrier.  It is anticipated that the sheet pile depth can also be adjusted to create varying window size as needed.  Preliminary design concept places the sheet pile at a depth of approximately 50 ft.  General Construction - The following engineering features are conceptual in nature and may or may not represent the final design of this project.  Soil-Cement Bentonite Slurry Wall - The Soil-Cement-Bentonite (SCB) slurry wall will be placed in a 3-ft wide trench cut out of a 6 ft. wide pre-blasted zone.  By possibly  pre-blasting this zone the properties of the porous limestone will change to a zone containing less permeable materials.  The trench is to be excavated through the pre-blasted zone of limestone down to a pre-established invert elevation with a base in the less permeable Tamiami Sands.  Typically soil-cement-bentonite (SCB) walls are 24 to 30 inches wide and match the width of the equipment.  In this case the blasted zone is anticipated to be approximately six (6) feet wide which allows for ~30 inch trench centered within the blasted lower permeability zone leaving lower permeability material on both sides of the trench.  It is reasoned that the engineered filter will enable the wall to be constructed using conventional excavating equipment (e.g., extended stick backhoe or similar) is probable, while minimizing loss of the bentonite slurry mixture.  After the six feet wide trench has been blasted, the 30-inch trench will be excavated.  As the excavation proceeds, bentonite-water slurry is continuously added to build a filter pack and ensure that the trench remains open.  After the blasted material has been excavated, it is replaced with a backfilled mixture of soil-cement-bentonite.  The preliminary mix design assumes 10 to 15% cement and 2 to 5% bentonite mixed with the excavated rock materials.  Sheet Pile Wall - A sheet pile wall will be constructed at the midsection of the slurry wall. This 100 ft long shallow sheet pile wall will be inserted to bridge the gap between the 2 sections of slurry wall to act as a shallow window directing or funneling any seepage flow.   The pumps could be possibly used to divert excess seepage.  The sheet pile depth of emplacement and size may be varied or later changed to create a window of varying size depending on need.  The method of installation may require a creative exaction technique (ex. Blasting through limestone layers), followed by pile driving to a pre-established invert elevation by hammer or vibratory methods.  There is likely to be some disturbance surrounding the piles so there is possible need for seepage tightening of the wall by grouting or other sealing methods.  This seepage tightening will seal any holes or gaps in between individual piles that remain after installation would be plugged. Disposal - All unsuitable material will be disposed of within the L-31N right-of-way. Cleared, grubbed and excavated materials that are suitable for reuse may be stockpiled on site for grading and erosion control of the embankment.  Staging - It is anticipated that the A-E contractor will need approximately 1 acre for staging construction trailers and 3-4 acres for the staging heavy construction equipment.  Access to the project site could be from State Rd 997 (Krome Ave.) and/or from U.S. Highway 41 (Tamiami Trail) by S-334 or S-356. As a first option, the team would like to the contractor to use the area is within the L-31N right-of way located along L-31N (south bank), beginning 0.5 mile south of the north gate at U.S. Highway 41, then southward about 0.25 mile.  The second option, the staging are would be located on the L-29 (north bank & levee), between S-334 and the south entrance of the L 30 levee.  Testing - After construction is completed, testing of the barrier system will be performed within a period of two years (two wet and two dry seasons) to determine the relative effectiveness of the seepage barrier.  The proposed work is located in Miami-Dade County, North of Tamiami Trail (US Highway 41) and Krome Avenue (Route 997).    The Magnitude of Construction is between $5,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. Proposals will be evaluated on technical, past performance and price. The draft plans (30%) are available on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. REMEMBER: DO NOT REGISTER AS A PLAN HOLDER AT THIS TIME.

The primary purpose of this notice is to comply with mandatory federal statutory acquisition procedures, prior to the award of a contract using other than full and open competition (FAR subpart 6.3). The Government intends to award a contract with one base year and (4) one year option periods, not to exceed five years from date of award.  The anticipated contract value shall not to exceed $4 million dollars. This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for quote.<BR><BR>Acquisition Background:<BR><BR>SBIR Phase 1 contract HQ0006-04-C-7067 awarded by Missile Defense Agency (MDA)<BR>SBIR Phase 2 contract HQ0006-06-C-7302 awarded by Missile Defense Agency (MDA)<BR>Titled:  Technologies to Improve Software Acquisition/Development Process<BR><BR>Description of Services:<BR><BR>The objective of this contract is to continue the development of the Radiation Hardened Catalog (RadCat) technology and demonstrate a web-based, radiation environment design and analysis toolkit by leveraging the Radiation Hardened Catalog (RadCat) technology developed in Phase I and Phase II.  The RadCat information management technology is an innovative way to capture known radiation test data on components as well as automatically interface this data to high fidelity models and radiation transport tools.  Methods and techniques currently employed for design and analysis of hardened electronic, electro-optical, and system level components are not automated and involve time-consuming radiation transport calculations by subject matter experts (SMEs) using crude geometric models. The RadCat technology developed under Phase I and Phase II allows limited manipulation of this data and limited interface to specific Computer Aided Design (CAD) model formats and only the Monte Carlo N-Particle 5 (MCNP5) radiative transport code. Phase III effort will develop the Radiation Hardness Assurance Toolkit (RadHAT) technology which will encompass a variety of 3-D Computer CAD model formats. The contractor will also attempt to develop the ability to interface those models with various radiation hardness analysis tools and the RadCat database. This capability will make it feasible for designers to quickly modify designs and select components based on automated interface with radiation transport and EMP analyses codes. The developed RadHAT technology will allow the designers and systems engineers to consider all radiation environments while utilizing the latest radiation test data available. This project is designed to ensure the timely availability of radiation survivability data to systems designers and analysts in an easily used format. This effort will continue to compliment and leverage survivability test programs performed and funded by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and various services by incorporating radiation test data on state-of-the-art components into the RadCat database.<BR><BR>Parties who object to this contract being awarded using other than full and open competition must provide their written objection to the contracting officer not later than the closing date of this announcement.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation (Request for Proposal). This announcement constitutes the only written solicitation/RFP that will be issued. It's important to note that the assets are being purchased for the material content versus the use of the actual items themselves. MFC 14925, Teledyne Brown Engineering, has agreed to sell the Air Force four Gun Barrel Shields and two Tomb Shields. Contract Line Item Numbers below describe the assets being purchased.
<p>CLIN 0001 Gun Barrel Shield 4 ea (approx 2,800 lbs each)</p>
<p>CLIN 0002 Tomb Shield 2 ea (approx 10,000 lbs each)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-4 and 52.212-5 apply. WAWF procedures apply.<br />FSC 6525 accurately reflects usage of the acquisitioned items.<br />The NAICS code is 331111, the size standard is 1,000. The type contract will be firm-fixed price. Due date/time is 01 Dec 2008, 2:30 p.m. Central Time. <br />POC: Linda McKee email Linda.McKee@brooks.af.mil or FAX 210-536-1918 to Attn of Linda McKee, reference FA8901-09-R-80013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Info Note: This is some very interesting and pertinent information regarding the requisition for Gun Barrel shields and Tomb shields. The items are being purchased specifically for the steel material content, not for use of the assets themselves. Based on my understanding of the information available ...steel produced "post World War II" contains measurable levels of radiation due to fallout contamination from detonation of the atomic bomb. The items identified for purchase are priceless because of the steel they are built with. It does not contain the radiation contamination found in current steel products.</p>

Currently, there are two Solicitations for Offer (SFOs) open for 25,000  30,000 rentable square feet of office space with the same requirements.  The first lease shall commence no later than March 15, 2009; the second lease shall commence approximately October 1, 2009.  Each space will be considered independently.  Offers may be submitted for either or both SFOs; if offers are submitted for both SFOs, they must be submitted separately.

SPACE SPECIFICATIONS: The space must be commercial office space located within one building complex.  The space needed is to satisfy an OPEN FLOOR PLAN; therefore, there must be no unreasonable demolition/reconfiguration restrictions.  It is NRELs intent to utilize systems furniture to the extent practical, minimizing the number of hard-walled enclosures.  NREL expects to house 110 to 130 occupants in the space, dependent upon the amount of space proposed.  Total leased space must have internal cyber connectivity of 1G Quest QMOE service or equivalent.  Cyber connecting equipment and internal cabling will be provided by lessee.  Leased space should be Full Service; meaning that all janitorial and maintenance services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.

The space offered must be within a building of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as modern office-type having fully adequate means of ingress and egress.  If building contains asbestos, it must be managed in accordance with approved local, state and federal regulations.  Buildings must fully meet the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS) and be in compliance with local building codes including seismic requirements.  Building must conform to Fire and Life Safety Codes as adopted by the Authority Having Jurisdiction.  Healthful and comfortable air shall be provided as described in the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning (ASHRAE) Standards 55 and 62.

LEASE TERM:  Commencing no later than March 15, 2009, the initial lease term shall be for a period not to exceed five years with an option to terminate at forty-two (42) months with 180 days written notice.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The space required is listed in approximate BOMA Net Rentable Square Feet (NRSF).  In the event it becomes necessary, any discrepancies identified will be discussed and reconciled by the parties.  NREL requests that Offeror provide an offer for the space listed above on an ANSI/BOMA NET RENTABLE basis.

ANSI/BOMA NET RENTABLE is defined as follows:

For the purposes of this lease, the Lessee and the Lessor recognize and agree to use the American National Standards Institute/Building Owners and Managers Association (ANSI/BOMA) International Standard (Z65.1-1996) definition for office area, which means the area where a tenant normally houses personnel and/or furniture, for which a measurement is to be computed.  ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet shall be computed by measuring the area enclosed by the finished surface of the room side of corridors (corridors in place as well as those required by local codes and ordinance to provide an acceptable level of safety and/or provide access to essential building elements) and other permanent walls, the dominant portion (refer to Z65.1) of building exterior walls, and the center of tenant-separating partitions where alcoves, recessed, entrances or similar deviation are not present.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. Solicitation AG-7217-S-09-0001 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP's). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), North Dakota State Office intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) to small business sources capable of providing abstract, title commitment and filing services for conservation easements. A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs. It is not a contract. The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders. For each work assignment, the Government will request title services through the issuance of a BPA call order from those firms that have been awarded BPA's. Individual call orders shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPA's. Government personnel authorized to place call orders under the BPA will be identified on the BPA by name and telephone number. The contractor will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the Statement of Work that accompanies the order.

Updating of abstracts, issuing title commitment and filing of easement documents will be for conservation easements located throughout the State of North Dakota. The contractor shall furnish all services, including obtaining title insurance from a title company approved by the U.S. Attorney General. The contractor will perform the same services as a commercial transaction, including updating of existing abstracts, creating abstracts (as deemed necessary), preparing preliminary and final title commitments, obtaining deeds and completion of any necessary curative instruments to assure merchantable title to the conservation easement. The Statement of Work is attached to this solicitation. Timely delivery of complete and accurate abstract and title commitments is crucial to the success of NRCS programs. Call order completion dates will vary depending on the phase of services provided. Obtaining abstracts from landowners may take additional time which in turn will affect completion of the updates and issuance of the preliminary title policy. However, the preliminary title policy will be due within 12 business days of abstract updates being finished. Final title policies shall be completed within 10 business days of contractor receipt of a NRCS Office of General Counsel Preliminary Title Opinion. Filed/recorded documents shall be returned to NRCS within 5 business days of contractor receipt from the County Recorders office. Timeframes may fluctuate and therefore will be negotiated with the Contracting Officer as deemed necessary.  

This is a Total Small Business Set Aside. The applicable NAICS Code is 541191, with a business size standard of $6.5M. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Abstract and Title Services are being sought for a period of five years with a contract period anticipated to be December 15, 2008 to September 15, 2013. The BPA will remain in effect until cancelled by either party.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 


(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, Management and Operating Contractor for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is seeking to lease between 25,000  30,000 rentable square feet of office space with associated utilities, within one building complex.  Currently, there are two Solicitations for Offer (SFOs) open for 25,000  30,000 rentable square feet of office space with the same requirements.  The first lease shall commence no later than March 15, 2009; the second lease shall commence approximately October 1, 2009.  Each space will be considered independently.  Offers may be submitted for either or both SFOs; if offers are submitted for both SFOs, they must be submitted separately.

Requirements:
LOCATION: Offers must be for available space within two miles of the NREL South Table Mountain facility located north of I-70 at Denver West Blvd. or the Administrative Offices located at 1617 Cole Blvd., both in Golden, Colorado.  Regularly scheduled public transportation within three (3) blocks and on-site employee and visitor parking sufficient to cover commuting and visitor needs should be available.

SPACE SPECIFICATIONS: The space must be commercial office space located within one building complex.  The space needed is to satisfy an OPEN FLOOR PLAN; therefore, there must be no unreasonable demolition/reconfiguration restrictions.  It is NRELs intent to utilize systems furniture to the extent practical, minimizing the number of hard-walled enclosures.  NREL expects to house 110 to 130 occupants in the space, dependent upon the amount of space proposed.  Total leased space must have internal cyber connectivity of 1G Quest QMOE service or equivalent.  Cyber connecting equipment and internal cabling will be provided by lessee.  Leased space should be Full Service; meaning that all janitorial and maintenance services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.  Space must be ready for occupancy no later than March 15, 2009, however, NREL will consider offers commencing prior to that date.  The space offered must be within a building of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as modern office-type having fully adequate means of ingress and egress.  If building contains asbestos, it must be managed in accordance with approved local, state and federal regulations.  Buildings must fully meet the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS) and be in compliance with local building codes including seismic requirements.  Building must conform to Fire and Life Safety Codes as adopted by the Authority Having Jurisdiction.  Healthful and comfortable air shall be provided as described in the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning (ASHRAE) Standards 55 and 62.

LEASE TERM:  Commencing no later than March 15, 2009, the initial lease term shall be for a period not to exceed five years with an option to terminate at forty-two (42) months with 180 days written notice.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The space required is listed in approximate BOMA Net Rentable Square Feet (NRSF).  In the event it becomes necessary, any discrepancies identified will be discussed and reconciled by the parties.  NREL requests that Offeror provide an offer for the space listed above on an ANSI/BOMA NET RENTABLE basis.

ANSI/BOMA NET RENTABLE is defined as follows:

For the purposes of this lease, the Lessee and the Lessor recognize and agree to use the American National Standards Institute/Building Owners and Managers Association (ANSI/BOMA) International Standard (Z65.1-1996) definition for office area, which means the area where a tenant normally houses personnel and/or furniture, for which a measurement is to be computed.  ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet shall be computed by measuring the area enclosed by the finished surface of the room side of corridors (corridors in place as well as those required by local codes and ordinance to provide an acceptable level of safety and/or provide access to essential building elements) and other permanent walls, the dominant portion (refer to Z65.1) of building exterior walls, and the center of tenant-separating partitions where alcoves, recessed, entrances or similar deviation are not present.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</p>
<p>MacDill AFB is seeking industry feedback regarding an approved cell tower site. This single site is located on the Southeast part of MacDill AFB near Bayshore Blvd. (see attached map) with a cell tower height limitation of 150 ft. AGL. Tower and supporting structures must meet MacDill architecture compatibility with surrounding facilities and design must be approved by base leadership. Provide suggestions/possibilities for tower concealment such as a clock tower, etc... but a flag pole will not be considered. In addition, provide feedback concerning the minimum amount of land needed to support a cell tower and any supporting structures and if there is a preferred/optimal footprint needed to support a cell tower and any supporting structures.</p>
<p>Specifically, the purpose of this market research is to determine industry interest in leasing government real estate for the purpose of constructing a cell phone tower on MacDill Air Force Base (AFB) and subletting space to other cell phone service providers. As part of the proposed tower construction and lease, MacDill AFB is seeking in-kind compensation based on an annual lease agreement vs. payment for leasing cell tower space. We anticipate the initial lease agreement to last for a period of 5 years. Construction of the tower will not be funded by MacDill AFB, the United States Air Force or any other government agency. The tower must accommodate a minimum of 6 providers for the purposes of consolidating cellular equipment/capabilities on MacDill AFB. Firms responding to this RFI are asked to provide the following information: company's full name, business size, DUNS/CAGE Codes, address and point of contact. Final responses to this RFI will be due on Dec. 15, 2008 at 4:00 pm ET. Send RFI responses to Lt Matthew Comer by fax or e-mail: matthew.comer@macdill.af.mil, Fax# 813-828-3667. Responses will be reviewed and may result in further clarifications to explore options with selected respondents. As industry may expect to see portions of submitted information in future solicitations, portions of the response containing proprietary information should be clearly marked as such. Information submitted will not be returned to the respective respondents. Oral submissions of information are not acceptable and will not be accepted in response to this notice.</p>
<p>For questions, please contact Jose Berenguer, Real Property Administrator, at 813-828-4260 or <a href="mailto:jose.berenguer.ctr@macdill.af.mil">jose.berenguer.ctr@macdill.af.mil</a></p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>

<DESC><p><strong><em>Expression of Interest (EOI) Sources Sought</em></strong>
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) will produce completed Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel assemblies for use in domestic, commercial nuclear power reactors. The MFFF design for the United States will be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), ensuring compliance with the most stringent design standards. The NRC's regulations are found in Chapter I of Title 10, "Energy," of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The criteria contained in 10 CFR 50 - Appendix B, Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants, will be applicable to this procurement.</p>
<p>The MFFF is a multi-functional complex containing all of the plutonium handling, fuel processing, and fuel fabrication operations. The MOX Fuel Fabrication Building (BMF) is a multi-story, hardened reinforced concrete structure enclosing approximately 441,000 sq. ft.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Description:</strong><br />Prior to requesting cost proposals, MOX Services will conduct a Workshop beginning&nbsp;10-December 2008 to be held in Aiken, South Carolina to discuss Zirconium and Stainless Steel (SS) equipment utilized in the Aqueous Polishing (AP) portion of the MFFF.</p>
<p>The zirconium and stainless steel equipment items that are currently planned to be included in the workshop are as follows:<br />A) Zirconium evaporator systems<br />B) 310L NAG evaporator systems<br />C) Pulsed Columns, buffer pot tanks and structural support frames<br />These systems are critical components of the MFFF AP process.</p>
<p>The purpose of this EOI is twofold:<br />&#61656; To announce the Workshop and obtain a listing of qualified suppliers interested in attending the workshop and,<br />&#61656; To obtain a listing of interested suppliers who desire to pre-qualify, subsequently bid, and if successful, supply evaporators systems fabricated of zirconium and 310L NAG SS, and SS pulse columns.</p>
<p>The workshop will last from one to two days, and is currently being planned to start on the morning of December 10th 2008. During the workshop MOX Services will conduct a presentation that is planned to include scope of work, technical requirements, quality assurance and general requirements. Interested attendees will be assigned time slots after the MOX presentation to engage in two way dialogue to review concerns, paths forward (timing, approach and execution) and other questions related to the evaporators and pulse columns. Suppliers interested in bidding on these work scopes and supplying any of this equipment to MOX Services are strongly advised to attend the workshop, however attendance is not mandatory.</p>
</p>
<p><span>Please be aware that the workshop&nbsp;will be a Engineering/Technical &amp; Construction/Fabrication presentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the most out of the&nbsp;WS we strongly urge as a minimum Discipline Engineers and Manufacturing Persons should attend.</span></p>
<p>
<p>Note: Cameras and recording devices will not be permitted.</p>
<p>Following the workshop and finalization of the Statement(s) of Work, Request for Proposals (RFP) will be solicited from qualified bidders to supply these components to MOX Services in accordance with the defined Statement(s) of Work (SOW) as summarized below.</p>
<p>Potential suppliers interested in attending the Workshop and/or to be considered to receive the RFP must provide the following information to the point of contact listed below.</p>
<p>1. Company information including company name, address and a main point of contact with phone number and e-mail address. <br />2. A brief description of company experience and capabilities, including applicable years of experience in providing this or like equipment. <br />3. A summary statement to describe the prospective supplier's Quality Program/Plan with regard to meeting requirements of ASME NQA-1 with 1995 Addendum and/or 10CFR50, Appendix B.<br />4. Statement of Intention to attend the Workshop as well as interest in reserving time for a one-on-one dialogue with MOX Services.<br />5. A signed Proprietary Information Agreement form (form will provided upon request)<br />6. Names and e-mail addresses for each attendee. Note: It is recommended that attendees be U.S. citizens. Foreign Nationals will require pre-approval.<br />7. Interested vendors can provide any additional pertinent information relevant to the stated procurement scope of work for MOX Service's review.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Statement of Work (SOW):</strong><br />The SOW includes all the labor, equipment, materials, and transportation as required to perform the final detailed design, design qualification and analysis (ASME and Seismic), fabrication, test and assembly in accordance with MOX Specifications, data sheets, detail and assembly drawings for the following equipment:</p>
<p>&bull; Zirconium and 310L NAG evaporator systems.<br />&bull; Pulsed Columns<br /><br />Upon delivery at the Savannah River Site, these items will be off-loaded, stored, and installed by others.</p>
<p>The evaporator system is designed to recover nitric acid from the process fluid effluents (raffinates) and recycle it back to the AP process. Each system is comprised of a hot water-heated boiler, evaporator, and interconnecting piping (including neutron counter boxes) assembled in a tubular structural support frame in accordance with the MOX Services design. Evaporator systems have a yearly operating cycle and are required to run continuously for 20 years. Fluid, thermal and thermodynamic design of the evaporator systems has been performed by MOX Services to meet the functional requirements of the MFFF.</p>
<p>Pulsed columns and pots handle radioactive fissile materials of varying neutron flux. Generally these items are specified as 304L and 316L SS. The geometry and configuration of the columns and pots ensures that the process remains in a sub-critical condition, and is in accordance with the MOX Services design. MOX Services has selected a variety of transient conditions as the design conditions for the design and fabrication of the pulsed columns, pots and tubular support structures. The input and output flows and the sizes of all connections are determined by MOX Services. The structural aspects are to be designed and fabricated by the Subcontractor.</p>
<p>This equipment is designated as Quality Level 1, an Item Relied on for Safety (IROFS). All material and services for the equipment furnished under the specification shall be furnished under a Quality Assurance Program approved by MOX Services for the work (e.g. design, qualification, procurement, fabrication, packaging and shipping of materials/equipment). The Subcontractor is required to have a documented Quality Assurance Program that implements 10CFR50 Appendix B, Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants as well as ASME NQA-1 1994 as revised by NQA-1a 1995 addenda.</p>
<p>The equipment and components require varying degrees of qualification and evaluation to withstand the effects of a seismic event (design earthquake) in order to prevent the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials.</p>
<p>Typically seismic Performance Requirements reflect the type of safety function performed:<br />&bull; SPR B1 SSC shall maintain nuclear material configuration<br />&bull; SPR B2 SSC shall maintain structural integrity<br />&bull; SPR B3 SSC shall maintain pressure boundary integrity</p>
<p>Qualification and evaluation requires design and analysis by a Professional Engineer and an appropriate NQA-1 Quality Assurance Program.</p>
<p>The RFP is scheduled to be issued during the first (1st) Quarter of 2009 with delivery on site July 2011.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Description of Equipment:</strong><br />Quality Level 1 evaporator systems scope includes the following quantities and types:<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quantity: 1 only, Zirconium system, fully assembled in a tubular structural support frame:<br /></span>A) Hot water-heated boiler<br />B) Evaporator<br />C) Interconnecting piping <br />D) Neutron counter boxes</p>

It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by June 2009. This announcement may result in multiple awards and is open to all businesses regardless of size. If concurrent multiple contract awards are made, task orders will be allocated based upon the Contracting Officer's determination of the special qualifications of the firms; the nature of the work involved in the task order; and the immediacy of the work and availability of the firm. Distribution of the work will be a secondary consideration. In the final selection process, the most highly qualified firms may be interviewed. All interested A -E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The target subcontracting goals for this contract are as follows: a minimum of 23% of the contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 5% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, 5% be placed with women-owned small businesses, 3.1% be placed with HUB Zone small business, and 1.5% be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum goals on the SF330. If a large business firm is selected for this contract, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiations. If the selected firm intends to submit a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale in the plan as to why the above goals cannot be met. The North American Industry Classification System code for this action is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4 million in average annual receipts. This contract will have a base period not to exceed one year and four one-year option periods, for a total IDIQ value not to exceed $12,000,000.

If more than one firm is selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. As determined by the employees office location (not the location of the work). Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract at the time of the original award.<br /><br />2.
