<p>Buyer: Sharita Culp, Ph: 405-734-8116; Fax: 405-734-8129; sharita.culp@tinker.af.mil</p>
<p>Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the Government to be similar in complexity and criticality, can be considered approved sources for this item.</p>
<p>Current qualified sources are: Goodrich (Cage: 3CPE0), Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacture meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br /><br />Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, intends to award a sole source contract to the Michigan Department of Community Health, 201 Townsend Street, Lansing, MI 48913 for the acquisition of services to re-consent a cohort of people and their offspring exposed to polybrominated biphenyls.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 923120, Administration of Public Health Programs. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.<br /><br />The contact information of the exposed cohort is proprietary data that is owned by the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH). MDCH is the only organization with the names and contact information of the members of the Michigan PBB cohort, and therefore is the only organization capable of executing the requirements of this contract.
<p>No other contractor can access this proprietary information owned by MDCH. No other contractor is able to identify cohort members and contact them. Further, MDCH has an established trust and relationship with cohort members and are more likely to have successful contact and re-consent than an outside contractor would. The time it would take for an outside contractor to attempt to locate and contact cohort members is unreasonable for the purpose of this requirement.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Michigan Department of Community Health. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-Q-13077 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN January 3, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1.

Knowledge of international bond markets is desirable.</p>

Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Global Trade Atlas Service (GTS). This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  This is a world trade data base that provides current monthly import/export trade data for 83 countries. FAS, ERS and the World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB) use the data to project the outlook for global agricultural trade, determine country agricultural production, and to determine trade agricultural patterns for negotiating FTA's. Cooperators use the data, to determine trade patterns, market intelligence, and world agricultural competition. ERS uses it for long term economic studies.
GTS publishes the official merchandise trade data by HS Code, for over 83 countries in its database.  This data is updated monthly and includes export and import data from the most general to the most detailed level of the HS available from each reporting country.  No other company or government agency, other than the UN, has collected such an extensive database and no one, in the public or private sector, has been successful in duplicating the GTS interface.  The assembly of the data, cross checking, underlying calculations, standardized presentation of the resulting analysis, the single user-interface providing easy and effective navigation of such a large set of data make the GTS database cost effective and efficient.  The ability to access and manipulate the data offered in the format designed by GTS greatly enhances staff's ability to provide quick and accurate trade-related analysis. 
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Global Trade Atlas Service (GTSI) currently provides these types of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide these types of subscriptions.

<p><br />I. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTS</p>
<p>Knowledge Required by the Position</p>
<p>The position requires either: knowledge of contracting principles, laws, regulations and procedures applicable to pre-award and/or post-award actions sufficient to procure and/or administer contracts for major development, testing, and/or production, or mastery of a procurement functional area sufficient to provide expert technical leadership, staff coordination, and consultation including responsibility for formulating guidelines, implementing new developments, and providing policy interpretation. Familiarity with business strategy and program or technical requirements is required sufficient to perform or direct in-depth evaluations of the financial and technical capabilities, or the performance, of the contractor.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Policies and precedents are available but stated in general terms or are of limited use. Extensive searches of a wide range of regulations and policy circulars are frequently required. The PSC uses experienced judgment and initiative in applying principles underlying guidelines, in deviating from traditional techniques, or in researching trends and patterns to develop new approaches, criteria, or proposed policies.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>The work is characterized by breadth of planning, review, and coordination or depth of problem identification and analysis, stemming from the variety of the procurement functions or from unknowns, changes, or conflicts inherent to the issues. Work involves varied duties requiring many different and unrelated processes and methods which cover the full range of contracting and assistance activities in the assigned functional area(s) or contract reviews which reveal trends and common problems.</p>
<p>Decisions involve responsiveness to continuing changes in programs or technological developments. Procurements typically require new or modified contract terms and conditions, funding arrangements, or policy interpretation throughout the pre-award and post award phases. The PSC develops data and recommends or initiates action to resolve a variety of problems under different award instruments such as contract awards and awards under assistance. Actions include factors not routinely encountered. Determining what needs to be done includes analysis of alternatives, adaptation, or modification of procedures, or resolution of incomplete or conflicting technical or contractor data.</p>
<p>Scope and Effect</p>
<p>The purpose of the work is to provide expertise as a specialist in a functional area of contracts and grants/cooperative agreements by furnishing advisory, planning, or reviewing services on specific problems, projects, or programs. The work affects a wide range of procurement and assistance activities such as the operation of procurement programs in various offices or locations, the accomplishment of significant procurement of technical program goals, or the economic position of contractors or on their respective geographic areas.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The space must be contiguous and on as few adjoining floors as practicable. Holding cells will be required; however detainees will not be housed overnight. A 20-foot setback from the building to the nearest point of vehicle access is also required. Where a 20-foot setback is not possible, alternative options, such as bollards, may be considered.

<a href="mailto:becky.c.dansereau@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Seattle</a>
<DESC><BR><BR>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE SF330 DOCUMENTS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO KATHALEEN SCHOLLARD AT KATHALEEN.SCHOLLARD@USACE.ARMY.MIL. <BR><BR>The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a requirement for an Architect-Engineer Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Electrical and Mechanical Design, Abbreviated Design, Electrical and Mechanical System Study, and Construction Support Services at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) and its Sub-Installations.  This procurement will be evaluated using Brooks Act (PL-92-582) procedures and FAR Part 36. THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION OPEN TO ALL QUALIFIED BUSINESS CONCERNS. The scope and purpose of this IDIQ contract will be for the preparation of design-bid-build and design-build solicitations involving electrical and mechanical disciplines, new construction as well as renovation and repair projects, electrical and mechanical system studies, and related construction support services for Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) Washington and its sub-installations. Individual Task Orders to be assigned under this contract will identify specific requirements.  <BR><BR>(A) DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall perform all or part of the following design services, as identified in individual Task Orders:   <BR><BR>1. General Scope: Prepare full or abbreviated designs, drawings, specifications,  preliminary studies, sketches, layout plans, surveys, reports, engineering calculations, and design-bid-build and design-build Request for Proposal (RFP) packages and cost estimates for a variety of projects involving the maintenance, repair, alteration and/or new construction of projects, mainly involving electrical and mechanical services at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and its sub-installations and projects assigned to Seattle District, USACE. Designs may also include design-build projects requiring preparation of material takeoffs and bills of materials. The Government may provide government designs, drawings, specifications, and standards for buildings, structures and other facilities as necessary to assist the A-E firm in meeting the requirements of the proposed project.  The number of copies of the RFP packages, designs, studies, sketches, plans and reports to be furnished to the Government will be set forth in each individual Task Order. <BR><BR><BR>2. Cost Estimates: A portion of the task orders may include designs with detailed cost estimates utilizing the Army Job Order Contract (JOC) Computerized Pricing Guide (CPG) WinEst.  WinEst is a Windows based RS Means database program designed for IBM PC compatible computers. This CPG system has been selected for use as the cost basis for all work under the JOC and may also be used for negotiated orders under the JBLM Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). The CPG contains more than 55,000 unit price construction line items for the description of work to be accomplished and for the unit of measure specified. Line item costs will be determined by multiplying the RS Means Bare Costs by the nearest available City Cost Index to localize the bare costs. The localized bare costs are then multiplied by the JOC or MATOC Contractor's coefficient. Cost estimates shall be automated utilizing the latest version of the automated pricing system. Multiple annual databases may be utilized depending on the date estimates are prepared or the terms of the individual JOC and MATOC contracts.  Cost estimates not generated out of WinEst may also be required for designs that will result in award of a construction task order against a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) or sole source stand alone contract where negotiations with only one contractor will be required. As such, effort under Task Orders may also include supporting government project managers in their negotiations with contractors prior to award of construction Task Orders.  <BR><BR><BR>3. Types of Projects: Projects may consist of mechanical, electrical, fire protection, civil, and/or architectural design or analysis, landscape design, interior design, and incidental hazardous material abatement surveys and reports. Some examples of projects include:  <BR>	<BR>	i. Repair and construction projects involving HVAC systems and components, lighting, wiring, communications, fire protection and alarm systems, intrusion detection systems, and CCTV systems.<BR>	ii. Repair and construction projects involving electrical utility system improvements, including installation and coordination of protective devices such as relays, reclosers, and fuses or sectionalizers; updates/improvements to SCADA systems, and repair/replacement/upgrade  of  major system components such as feeders and substations. <BR>	iii.

<DESC><BR>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE SF330 DOCUMENTS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO KATHALEEN SCHOLLARD AT KATHALEEN.SCHOLLARD@USACE.ARMY.MIL. <BR><BR>The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a requirement for an Architect-Engineer Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Civil/Environmental Design and Construction Support Services, primarily for Joint Base Lewis-McChord Washington and its Sub-Installations. This procurement will be evaluated using Brooks Act (PL-92-582) procedures and FAR Part 36. THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION OPEN TO ALL QUALIFIED BUSINESS CONCERNS. The scope and purpose of this IDIQ contract will be to provide Architect-Engineering (A-E) services for civil and environmental design, abbreviated design and construction support services primarily for Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), Washington and its sub-installations.  Required services will include full or abbreviated design services, civil/environmental design, and environmental studies for renovation, repair and minor construction projects, as well as construction support services.  Services under this IDIQ may also include some landscaping, mechanical, and electrical design.  Individual task orders to be assigned under this contract will identify specific requirements.  <BR><BR><BR>(A) DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall perform all or part of the following design services, as identified in individual Task Orders:   <BR><BR>1. General Scope: Prepare full or abbreviated designs, drawings, specifications, preliminary studies, sketches, layout plans, surveys, reports, engineering calculations, and design-bid-build and design-build Request for Proposal (RFP) packages and cost estimates for a variety of projects involving the maintenance, repair, alteration and/or new construction of projects, mainly for civil/environmental studies and design services at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and its sub-installations and projects assigned to Seattle District, USACE. Designs may also include design-build projects requiring preparation of material takeoffs and bills of materials. The Government may provide government designs, drawings, specifications, and standards for buildings, structures and other facilities as necessary to assist the A-E firm in meeting the requirements of the proposed project.  The number of copies of the RFP packages, designs, studies, sketches, plans and reports to be furnished to the Government will be set forth in each individual Task Order. <BR><BR><BR>2. Cost Estimates: A portion of the task orders may include designs with detailed cost estimates utilizing the Army Job Order Contract (JOC) Computerized Pricing Guide (CPG) WinEst.  WinEst is a Windows based RS Means database program designed for IBM PC compatible computers. This CPG system has been selected for use as the cost basis for all work under the JOC and may also be used for negotiated orders under the JBLM Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). The CPG contains more than 55,000 unit price construction line items for the description of work to be accomplished and for the unit of measure specified. Line item costs will be determined by multiplying the RS Means Bare Costs by the nearest available City Cost Index to localize the bare costs. The localized bare costs are then multiplied by the JOC or MATOC Contractor's coefficient. Cost estimates shall be automated utilizing the latest version of the automated pricing system. Multiple annual databases may be utilized depending on the date estimates are prepared or the terms of the individual JOC and MATOC contracts.  Cost estimates not generated out of WinEst may also be required for designs that will result in award of a construction task order against a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) or sole source stand alone contract where negotiations with only one contractor will be required. As such, effort under Task Order may also include supporting government project managers in their negotiations with contractors prior to award of construction Task Orders.<BR><BR><BR>3. Types of Projects: Projects may consist of architectural, civil, mechanical and/or electrical design, landscape design, interior design, and hazardous material abatement surveys and reports. Some examples of projects include:  <BR>	i.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the NASA/DFRC to post a potentialGovernment requirement via the internet and solicit responses from interested parties. This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry theopportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well aspromote competition.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments orquestions to the primary point of contact, Andrea Basham, no later than January 7, 2011. When responding reference NND11Z56789L.1.0 IntroductionThe NASA Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) Flight Opportunities Program (hereafterthe Program) combines the FY 2010 Facilitated Access to the Space environment forTechnology (FAST) and Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research (CRuSR) efforts previouslymanaged by the Innovative Partnership Program Office. The integration of these effortsallows for greater program management alignment and provides the technology communityaccess to the microgravity environment via multiple platforms.The Program intends to mature to flight readiness status crosscutting technologies thatadvance multiple future space missions. To this end, the Program will provide frequentflight opportunities for technology payloads to fly on both parabolic aircraft andsuborbital reusable launch vehicles (sRLVs) that are capable of flying to altitudes above100 km.  This Request for Information (RFI) only pertains to sRLVs.  Payloads may fly inany part of the sRLV flight envelope. NASA is presently not considering human-tendedpayloads to be flown on sRLVs, and there will not be any NASA sponsored participants onsRLV flights relating to this particular announcement. The payloads to be flown on sRLVflights must operate autonomously.The Program intends to acquire the services of commercial sRLV providers and commercialpayload integrators to fly technology payloads on missions that help the Program achievethe goals of the OCT.  The technology payloads are being solicited under a separateAnnouncement of Opportunity (AO) issued by the Program [ref]. The Program foresees thefollowing two scenarios to fly these payloads: 1) the flight provider provides the flightas well as payload integration services (either in-house or subcontracted); or, 2) thepayload integrator procures the flight service and integrates the payload.  In bothcases, the Program intends to procure as a single procurement both the payloadintegration service and the flight service.The Program will hold an Industry Meeting at the Dryden Flight Research Center on January25, 2011, to discuss the subject RFI and a future solicitation for flight and payloadintegration services.  An open question and answer forum between the Program and theindustry will be held at the Industry Meeting.	Additional information, including anagenda, will be provided at the Program website: http://flightopportunities.nasa.gov  .2.0 Request for InformationThe Program seeks to ascertain from the sRLV industry how it will provide flight andpayload integration services to fly missions for Program-provided payloads.  The Programintends to use the responses to this RFI to develop a solicitation for sRLV flights andpayload integration services.  This RFI does not pertain to parabolic aircraft, only tosRLVs.2.1 Flight Service ProvisionFlight service provision is defined as the service that delivers an integrated payload toa desired environment aboard an sRLV.  An example of such a service is an sRLV flying to100km and providing 3-4 min of reduced gravity to the payload. Flight services include,but are not limited to:-	Flight operations, including operation of the payload-	Flight and ground safety-	Coordination of launch license with the FAA-	Vehicle airworthiness-	Payload recovery-	Mishap planning and response2.2 Integration Service ProvisionIntegration service provision is defined as integration of a payload to the flightvehicle, while ensuring that the interfaces to other payloads and to the flight vehicleare compatible and that the mission requirements of the payload investigator are met. Integration services may include, but are not limited to:-	Ensuring that the payload can meet the environmental requirements (e.g.,vibration, pressure, and thermal requirements) specified by the flight service provider -	Establishing the payload operational and mission performance requirements and themission exit criteria with the payload investigator-	Developing and coordinating the payload interface control documents(ICDsmechanical, electrical, data) with flight service provider-	Verifying the payload against the ICDs and environmental requirements, includingsystem-to-system interactions with other payloads and the flight vehicle-	Providing engineering and system safety analyses to inform the Mission RiskAssessmentThe Program may elect to fly payloads from foreign countries or payloads withexport-sensitive technologies (i.e., that fall under ITAR regulations).  The Providershould describe how they would handle such payloads.2.3 Standard ServiceThe Program would like to ascertain from the sRLV industry the standard services thatcould be procured on a fixed-price basis.  The Provider should describe standardinterfaces (mechanical, electrical, data, command and control, etc.), standard flightprofiles, the standard operating range(s), etc., that are part of the standard serviceprovision.2.4 Non-Standard ServiceIt is likely that some of the Program-provided payloads will not conform to a standardservice provision offered by the Provider.  In such cases, the Program would like toascertain how such non-standard payloads could be accommodated.  In particular, theProgram would like to understand the processes, and to the extent possible thecost-basis, for accommodating non-standard payloads.2.5 History of ServiceThe Program would like to understand the Providers history providing payload integrationand/or flight services.  The Provider should describe payload integrations, flight andground operations, or other expertise that are relevant to flying technology payloads onsRLVs.	The Provider should describe experience working with specific launch facilities.2.6 Quality StandardsThe Provider should describe the quality standards and standard processes that areemployed to ensure that the Program receives a quality product.  The Provider shoulddescribe any rationale that promotes confidence to the Program that the Provider candeliver a quality product.2.7 Educational OutcomesNASAs mission is to Drive advances in science, technology, and exploration to enhanceknowledge, education, innovation, economic vitality, and stewardship of the Earth.

BACKGROUND: &bull; ATK Launch Systems provided technical services to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) since 1997. Prior to that, these services were provided by ATK to SMDC through a contract with Sandia National Labs. The initial contracts assessed the Polaris A3 Second Stage Rocket Motor for the Strategic Target System (STARS) flight program. The motors were evaluated for aging/surveillance characteristics of the propellant, case, igniter and nozzle. Tests were performed to monitor safety and hazards of the propellant stabilizers to ensure the motors were safe to transport. Prior to flight, each motor was disassembled, inspected and certified for use. &bull; The ATK services and technical support evolved to require various tasks on the rocket motors in support of MDA&rsquo;s target and interceptor programs. The remaining A3 STARS motors continue to be evaluated during phase-out and prior to thermal treatment. The Ground-based Midcourse Defense Guidance Enhanced Missile 40 BV+ motors are assessed for alternate storage options. Data is gathered on Kinetic Energy Interceptors motors during the shutdown phase. The Trident 1 C4 motors are used for targets, an aging/safety assessment of these motors are required and certificates are necessary prior to flight. &bull; The current contract W9113M-06-D-0002 for rocket motor technical services, was awarded sole source to ATK on February 06, 2006 and will expire in February 2011. 3.

<RESPDATE>123010
<CONTACT>George W Kennedy, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 451-2607, Fax (301) 480-4675, Email kennedyg@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><strong>Introduction<br /></strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to establish multi-disciplinary centers that focus on understanding at a molecular level the host-pathogen interaction using a systems biology approach.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The primary goal of the activities carried out under this contract will be to investigate and identify the metabolic, regulatory, signaling, and other biological pathways generated by host-pathogen molecular interactions to help explain and predict clinical manifestations of infectious diseases, host responses, disease progression, and outcomes. Studies will focus on persistent or recurrent infections with well-defined, highly-specific phenotypes. Examples of such infections include, for example, tuberculosis, malaria, leishmaniasis, histoplasmosis, and infections caused by cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes virus, Salmonella spp., Group A streptococci, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Although a systems biology approach could be used to investigate complex biological events, such as cell behavior or microbial communities, the focus of this contract is only on molecular cellular events of the interaction of the pathogen and the host, such as those involved in the biological, biochemical and biophysical processes of microbial organisms or in pathogenesis and disease progression in humans.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Each multi-disciplinary center, composed of teams of investigators with a wide breadth of skills and scientific and technical expertise, will carry out these investigations through one or more Research Projects. The research findings of such projects should have the potential to be applicable or relevant to a variety of pathogenic organisms, which may help to identify common molecular mechanisms that cause persistent and recurrent infections and should lead to a better understanding of the biological, biochemical and biophysical processes of host-pathogen interaction or of the initiation and progression of infectious diseases in humans. Examples of Research Projects include:</p>
<p>&bull; predict, identify and quantify changes in expression of the transcriptome or proteome of both the host and the microbial organism in a human macrophage culture model during various stages of persistent and recurrent infection of the host.<br />&bull; predict, identify and quantify the transcriptional, regulatory and metabolic response of the host's immune response system in various stages of persistent and recurrent infection.<br />&bull; develop models that predict metabolic and regulatory networks that will facilitate the identification of genes that may be coding for virulence determinants and contribute towards the progression of persistent and recurrent infection and disease in different host cells; verify experimentally.<br />&bull; apply transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics profiling to assay the network state of infected host cell cultures; develop a predictive model and validate in infected human tissue for persistent or chronic infections.</p>
<p>Research Projects conducted under this contract should employ a combination of innovative, experimental systems biology approaches, including high-throughput "omics" technologies, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics or lipidomics. Rigorous novel algorithms and analytical methods, including bioinformatics should also be included. It is expected that integrated data sets will be used to build mathematical models of host-pathogen interactions that can be validated by experimental approaches, explaining the molecular basis of clinical manifestations of infectious diseases, including severity and response to treatment and vaccines. Furthermore, results obtained from these studies should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of diseases caused by potential agents of bioterrorism and emerging/reemerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: This contract is NOT for studies on HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: This contract is NOT for studies that focus exclusively on the molecular interaction networks of the microbe with no consideration of those in the host cells, and vice versa. Examples include:</p>
<p>&bull; analysis of the microbial response to infection in absence of the host response to infection;<br />&bull; analysis of host response to infection in the absence of microbial pathogenesis studies;<br />&bull; analysis of the host control of expression and signaling through innate immune receptors without focus of host-pathogen interaction;<br />&bull; dissection of the molecules and pathways involved in the regulation of the adaptive immune system without focus of the host-pathogen interaction; and<br />&bull; studies of host pathways that regulate antibody production to pathogens.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: This contract will not cover costs associated with human sample collection.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance</strong></p>
<p>It is anticipated that a level of effort type contract will be awarded, with a base period of performance of 12 months, beginning approximately February 1, 2012. The base effort required will be 13 full time equivalents (FTE's) per year for the base period of performance (Year 1), and each of the 12 month option periods (Years 2 through 5). The Government anticipates the 13 FTE's to be comprised of the following:</p>
<p>- Two (2) Senior FTE's (PI/co-PIs/Project Director/Project Manager); and <br />- Eleven (11) FTE's (Post-docs/Technical staff/Bioinformatics Professionals and Software Engineers).</p>
<p>In addition, during each contract year, the Government may exercise options for incremental increases in the level of effort by up to three (3) FTE's in postdoctoral, technical, bioinformatics professional/software engineering staff, to respond to emerging needs related to the proposed research.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">MARKET SURVEY<br />FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS)<br />GLOBAL PEACE OPERATIONS INITIATIVE (GPOI)</p>
<p><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando FL, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources to procure, ship and install training aids in foreign countries to train military and police units identified under the Department of State Global Peace Operations Initiative. The training aids will support the training exercises created by the Naval Postgraduate School Center for Civilian-Military Relations (CCMR) and will be delivered and installed in foreign training centers and compounds. <br />Three different categories of training aids will be procured. The first category of training aids is for the design and installation of electronic classrooms that support the training curriculum. In a very limited number of cases the contractor may need to modify an existing building to bring it up to standards required for an electronic classroom. The second category of training aids includes equipment required to conduct field exercises within the foreign country's training compound. Types of aids include but are not limited to radios/communications gear, riot gear, personal protection equipment and in some cases tents, cooking equipment, and personal hygiene equipment. The third category of supplies that might be required includes vehicles that would be used within the country's training compound. Possible types of vehicles are trucks, water purification units and generators.<br />The responses to this Market Survey will be used to determine if the procurement will be set-aside for a small business category.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br /></strong>The foreign destinations may include but not be limited to the following countries:<br />&bull; Central and South America: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay and Uruguay<br />&bull; North Africa &amp; Middle East: Ethiopia, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia<br />&bull; Pacific: Fiji and Philippines<br />&bull; Sub-Sahara Africa: Benin, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa and Zambia<br />&bull; Asia: Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal and Thailand<br />&bull; Eastern Europe: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY  SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at  http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/crane/working/contracting.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. 

Synopsis:  To promote exchange of information with industry in accordance with FAR Part 15.2, the Naval Surface Warfare Center  Crane Division (Crane) issues this Request For Information (RFI).
  Crane is requesting information from industry to identify potential candidate battery modules to fill a possible need for a standard battery in manned and unmanned maritime vehicles.  Crane is also requesting information from maritime systems designers to (1) determine interest in using the described battery modules or (2) describe requirement changes that would make these modules suitable for a specific use.

Threshold Requirements: 

Battery modules (collection of cells in vendor-selected configuration) must allow for flexible configuration into large battery assemblies in various types of enclosures including pressure vessels.
1.	Battery modules (collection of cells in vendor-selected configuration) must contain 1,000 to 15,000 watt-hours with specific energy of 100 watt-hours per kilogram (100Wh/kg) minimum at the module level after 200 charge / discharge cycles (up to C/6 maximum discharge rate and up to C/10 maximum charge rate, where C is the rated ampere-hour capacity of the module after 200 charge / discharge cycles).
2.	When connected together in any possible configuration of batteries consisting of two to ten adjacent modules in batteries employing multiple modules up to 1.5 megawatt-hours total, an actual or simulated cell or battery management system malfunction or defect does not cause adverse effects, such as a release of corrosive chemicals or fire, that propagate to adjacent modules or outside of the battery.
 
3.	Battery modules must be able to be connected in batteries that will be exposed to steady-state charging voltages up to 330 volts.
4.	Battery modules shall include a fail-safe mechanism such that, if other battery management system elements fail to properly terminate a charge, the mechanism terminates charge before the charge current damages the module.     
Objective Requirements:
Information should reflect consideration of military air transport and surface and undersea maritime storage, transport, and operation (temperature range, humidity, salt fog, vibration, mechanical shock) as well as maintenance (interconnect access and battery disassembly).
1.	As representations of possible applications, information should reflect (a) possible electrical interconnections, modules, and monitoring and control systems layout for a battery fitting within a 76.0 inch long 18.0 inch inner diameter metal cylinder; (b) possible electrical interconnections, modules, and monitoring and control systems for a battery fitting within an 36.0 inch long 19.0 inch wide 7.0 inch tall metal enclosure; and (c) possible electrical interconnections, modules, and monitoring and control systems layout for a battery fitting within a 48.0 inch long 9.5 inch inner diameter metal cylinder.
 
2.	If it meets other requirements, a module with specific energy higher than 180 Wh/kg is highly desirable. 
3.	When assembled into a battery, a remote indication of module status is highly desirable. Modules should include a means by which module status can be reported.
4.	Calendar life should exceed four years from date of manufacture.  The manufacturer should describe steps needed to ensure that a battery is ready for use up to four years from the date of manufacture.  
5.	Information should reflect non-binding approximate costs to deliver (a) 25 modules, (b) electrical interconnections, modules, and monitoring and control systems for a battery fitting within a 76.0 inch long 18.0 inch inner diameter metal cylinder provided by the Government, and (c) electrical interconnections, modules, and monitoring and control systems for a battery fitting within an 18.0 inch long 9.5 inch wide 7.0 inch tall metal enclosure provided by the Government.
 
6.	The information should explicitly identify overcurrent and overtemperature devices included in the module design.
Interested parties shall submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper").  This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, battery management system concepts, and a rough cost estimate.  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically to the NSWC Crane technical point of contact below NLT 4:00 PM EST 2/25/2011. 

This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.
  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.

White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of this announcement.  The following point of contact is provided for information regarding technical issues: Mr. Dan Kieffner, email dan.kieffner@navy.mil, phone 812-327-6569.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  This is NOT a request for proposals, only a request for sources that are capable of performing this construction project. Cover letters and unnecessary elaborate brochures, or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective response are not desired. Telegraphic and facsimile submissions will not be accepted. Solicitation packages are not provided and no additional project information will be given to firms during the announcement period.  Personal visits for the purpose of discussing this announcement will not be scheduled. <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island District intends to solicit for this construction project; Rice Lake Habitat Rehabilitation and Enhancement Project (HREP), Stage I located at LaGrange Pool, Illinois Waterway, Banner, Illinois.  The construction project work may include, but not be limited to: clearing and grubbing, excavation, overflow spillway, pre-cast concrete box culvert, reinforced concrete outlet structure, reinforced concrete pump station, masonry control building, three submersible 48-inch pumps, motors, motor control center, chain-link fencing, granular surfacing, stone protection (bedding stone and riprap), dredging, water control structures, gatewell structure, fish egress structure, discharge channel, and seeding.  <BR><BR>The timeframe to accomplish this work would be over two construction seasons.  The project area encompasses over 4,000 acres with access limited to either end.  The upstream access road terminates at a public boat ramp so the Contractor must maintain one lane of traffic at all times.  The downstream access road is also used by a local quarry.  Portions of the project area will not be accessible during various times of the year and will largely depend on the elevation of the Illinois River.  The Contractor will need to coordinate with the local utility company to provide electrical service to the project site to include reconstruction of the primary line, an overhead transformer, and secondary conductors.  The pump station is to be constructed adjacent to the river and dredging will be required to provide a channel to the pump station intake.  A portion of the overflow spillway will be constructed across an interior lake using material from the adjacent lake bottom.  The elevation of this lake will vary and will often fluctuate with river elevations.  Coordination with the local Sponsor will be required (Illinois DNR), especially during the fall, when the area is utilized for duck hunting.<BR><BR>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Responses must be received no later than Monday, December 27, 2010.  Please clearly indicate the solicitation number, project name Rice Lake HREP Stage 1, in the subject line of the email or on the outside of the package.  Proposals must be received by no later than 4:00 PM CST on the indicated response date.  Submittals by facsimile transmission will not be accepted and will be considered non-responsive.   Please forward information and specifications of the requested construction project you can provide, a company Point of Contact (POC), as well as your complete company information, including CAGE code and Construction Bonding dollar levels.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting a market survey to obtain information on responsible sources that are considered to be a 100% small businesses as defined by FAR Part 19; based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 811310; that have the capability to provide Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) for two existing Automated Wash Rack Systems located at Marine Corps Base (MCB) Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.  The CLS support services for the automated wash racks shall include scheduled Preventive Maintenance (PM) activities on a monthly basis to prevent system down-time.
  The maintenance program shall be established on the premise that all maintenance actions performed on the systems fall into one of two basic categories: scheduled maintenance or unscheduled maintenance. Maintenance actions, scheduled or unscheduled, shall be performed at the lowest level possible by trained technicians to ensure equipment is maintained in a safe and cost efficient manner. The automated wash rack systems shall be capable of operation 90% of the days in a month except when systems are not operational due to acts of God, and damage caused by the customer.  The results of the PM services and the systems performance will be reported monthly to the CPAC Program Office.  When identified, the contractor shall initiate corrective action for unscheduled maintenance actions within two (2) working days of identification by the CPAC Site Representative.
  Cause for exceeding this goal is usually the direct result of restricted or lack of access to systems due to user absence, established security requirements or unavailability of parts required to return the system into service.  Repairs taking longer than five (5) days shall be reported to the CPAC Program Office.  The contractor shall monitor the two (2) active sites and systems for proper operation and to identify potential system malfunctions. The Contractor shall provide scheduled PM  services based upon the recommendations of the equipment manufacturer which are designed to extend the useful service life of the equipment and maintain the equipment in an operational state.  These scheduled maintenance actions (i.e., high pressure pump maintenance, filter cleaning, belt adjustments, tank inspections, water pressure adjustments, motor and seal inspections and calibrations) are generally based on either hourly or calendar timeframes.
 The Contractor shall ensure that the PM schedule supports the usage and conditions of each site.  The Contractor shall coordinate their scheduled PM visits to the units at least five (5) working days in advance.  In those cases where an unscheduled maintenance visit is required at one (1) or more of the sites, the Contractor shall make the attempt to notify the equipment owner of the unscheduled maintenance requirement as early as possible. Each site with an active system being monitored and maintained, will receive a minimum of one (1) visit per calendar month by the Contractors technician capable to perform the required PM. 
 
MARCORSYSCOM will use the results of this announcement to determine what capabilities exist in the marketplace.
  MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request for information.  Interested parties are requested to submit a response in a Microsoft Office Word 2007 and/or compatible format, not to exceed 10 pages, outlining their ability to meet or exceed the requirements identified above by no later than 5:00 PM EST, 29 December 2010.  Firms should also include their business size/type, past performance for the same type of services, and General Services Administration (GSA) Contract Number, if applicable.  Only electronic submissions will be accepted.  Interested sources shall send responses via e-mail to andrias.woody@usmc.mil. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY SERVICES/ITEMS.

<DESC>Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of the competitive process.  Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the VA is looking for sources able to  provide an integrated, enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS). The VA understands the breadth and depth of the desired RTLS solution and is looking to determine the ability of industry to provide a total integrated solution.  

Overview

VHA is comprised of 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) that are each responsible for managing health care activities within their geographic area that can include six to ten medical facilities and a number of supporting outpatient facilities. (Details can be found at http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1) VA medical centers (VAMCs) within a VISN work together to provide efficient, accessible health care to Veterans in their areas.  With 163 VAMCs nationwide, VHA manages one of the largest health care systems in the United States.

VHA seeks a turnkey, integrated RTLS to be deployed nationwide.  The purpose is to improve the efficiency of certain business processes in its hospitals and clinics. The goals for RTLS are to:
o	Improve operational efficiency
o	Decrease operational costs 
o	Maximize equipment utilization
o	Increase clinical efficiencies and staff productivity
o	Reduce delays in patient care
o	Minimize lost and misplaced items
o	Improve the quality of service from patient, physician, and institution perspectives
o	Provide medical centers with the real-time capability to actively track all assets, medical supplies, staff, patients, and environmental conditions (point source monitoring of items) through a common interface and reporting tool.
o	Provide national-level reporting and information sharing through an enterprise database

For the purpose of this RFI, "enterprise" is defined as deployment within one or more VISNs.  Solutions to be considered shall include: application software, all necessary hardware (servers, receivers, ID tags), services (installation, integration, maintenance, training) and any additional ancillary equipment for tracking of equipment, implants, staff and patients.

Requirements

VHA is seeking potential sources capable and interested in providing an enterprise RTLS for the purpose of tracking equipment, supplies, specimens, instruments, staff, and patients, among other possible uses.  In addition, environmental monitoring such as humidity and temperature will be required.  VHA is also interested in the ability of a single source to provide multiple technologies for deployment (using existing wireless infrastructure, non-wireless infrastructure, or contractor specific infrastructure) and the ability to use multiple tags and technologies to meet specifications and specialized needs.  All RTLS data from a given facility must roll up into a single database, and be accessible via a single user interface.  The RTLS system at each facility must also be capable of exchanging data with VA information systems and with RTLS systems at other facilities and/or with a single national information system that serves to aggregate and display RTLS data from all VA facilities.

For the purposes of this RFI, VHA has defined the following space areas.  Please consider all of these areas when responding to relevant questions. 

Campus	Multiple Buildings on an area of land belonging to a facility.

Building	A free-standing structure

Floor	An entire level in a building

Zone	A defined area on a floor:  multiple spaces

Room	Smaller unit on a floor / zone.  Has a defined entrance / exit point.

Individual Patient Care Vicinity	A designated area within a room.  Bed or Bay area.
 

The range of RTLS capabilities with which VHA wishes to begin with initial deployment, shall include but are not limited to the following:

A.	Asset Tracking Capability - Provide VHA staff with the capability to locate portable assets used throughout the medical facility to support the delivery of health care services; varying levels of discrimination should be offered to meet site specific requirements from area level discrimination to more discrete room level discrimination in real time.  

B.	Supply, Processing and Distribution (SPD) Automation Capability - Enhance SPD business processes through automation as it supports SPD staff responsibility for tracking, cleaning and distributing medical equipment to clinical staff throughout the medical facility by automating the tracking tasks.  

C.	Inventory Management Capability - Monitor the usage of medical supplies and equipment necessary for critical patient procedures, particularly in specialty labs, such as cardiac cath.  RTLS solutions in these areas provide real-time transparency for designated items that are "on the shelf", used in a case, or missing.  The RTLS solution can support par level maintenance to ensure maximum efficiency and availability of a wide range of hospital supplies and equipment.

D.	Automated Temperature Capability - Provide real time temperature monitoring for refrigerated areas that store pharmaceuticals, tissues, organs, blood, food, and other items at specified temperatures.  The system can monitor and record temperatures at predetermined time intervals and immediately report any temperature anomalies based on configured thresholds.

E.	Business Process Workflow - Track hospital staff and patients at VA medical facilities, with the objective of monitoring business activities, such as tracking a patient presented to the Emergency Department from arrival to disposition.  The goal is to improve workflow through analysis of the monitoring data provided by the RTLS.

F.	Technical Engineering Services - Required services may include Software Configuration; Upgrades and Updates to all delivered software; Technical Engineering Services (Installation, De-installation, Relocation of RTLS components), Middleware Development services, Commercially available Middleware Services; System Integration; RTLS Implementation Support; Software Development Services; Maintenance, Warranty and Training.  Solutions shall integrate all technology to provide a transparent solution to the user.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT.

The VA New Jersey Health Care System intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source procurement with CEPHEID, INC to provide and install a GeneXpert Infinity, 48-24 System via a Cost-Per-Test (CPT)/Cost-Per-Reportable Result (CPRR) acquisition.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy this requirement.  This is a sources sought to determine the availability of potential sources having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform/provide the SPECIFIED BRAND NAME OR EQUIVALENT EQUIPMENT.  

The Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service at Veterans Administration New Jersey Health Care System (VA New Jersey) is currently using Molecular Diagnostic equipment and technology in the nationwide VA effort to eradicate MRSA from our healthcare network. We perform this MRSA testing using the GeneXpert-16 System manufactured and distributed by Cepheid. Cepheid Inc. has exclusive rights for manufacturing and distributing our current GeneXpert System, GeneXpert cartridges & diagnostic software for use with the Cepheid Invitro Diagnostic Xpert cartridges for the performance of a number of tests including MRSA. We are now seeking to upgrade to a compatible, commercially available system to continue performing MRSA testing and to expand our test menu to include (but not limited to): GBS, EV, C.diff, MRSA/SA Skin and Soft Tissue (SSTI), MRSA/SA Blood Culture (BC), and H1N1. Additionally, the test menu should preferably be broad and include molecular testing for non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions such as cancers (BCR-ABL, JAK2, etc.), blood disorders (Factor II/Factor V mutations, etc.), and other infectious diseases (VRE, drug-resistance tuberculosis, and MRSA/SA Nares). 
The GeneXpert Infinity48-24 System has the following advantages and features:
"	The high through-put, molecular diagnostic system that can produce more than 1,300 different test results per day.
"	Robotic cartridge handling, managed by Cepheid's Xpertise software.
"	Continuous sample processing operation mode allows true 24/7 results.   
"	Random access capability - different assay protocols can be run at the same time or may be started at different times and run at the same time.  
"	The fully integrated sample extraction process and automated real-time PCR system contribute to ease of use, productivity, reproducibility and reduced turn-around-time.
"	Simplicity and ease of use for true deploy ability and sustainability.
o	Only five (5) manual steps to introduce specimen into instrument.
o	Manual steps take a total of approximately 2 minutes per sample.
o	Manual steps can be conducted by any trained staff-member - not limited to highly-trained/skilled employees.
o	No precision pipetting steps.
o	Simple enough to be operated during any shift and report results.   
"	Batching is not required to achieve either operational efficiency or cost savings.
"	Each assay contains sample processing control, internal control, and probe check control - external controls are not required. Does not require separately processed controls with each run.
"	Results in less than 58 minutes.
"	Closed System - reduces potential for amplicon contamination.
"	No special lab requirements for PCR setup and testing.
"	Utilizes primarily lyophilized reagent technology vs. liquid reagents - contributes to ease of use, reagent stability, and reproducibility.
The proposed period of the contract will be for a base year + 4 option years.

<DESC>THE 2007 NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE APPICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:  221 UTILITIES

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

The Naval facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC-MA) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C . 2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation.
  This contract is referred to as a Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC).  For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated.

The proposed procurement is for identification of various Energy Conservation Measures in specified areas via a no-cost preliminary energy audit.  This project provides for energy efficiency upgrades at locations at Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division, Newport, RI.  The primary goal of the project is to reduce energy consumption and provide more sustainable building infrastructure at NUWC, Newport, RI.

The preliminary audit will require on-site building investigation and evaluation to determine if any significant energy conservation opportunities exist and whether further detail energy analysis is warranted.
  The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC which includes but are not limited to the feasibility study phase; the engineering and design phase, the implementation phase.   The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms at least as good as those available to customers in a comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile.  Therefore contractors will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long-term (10 years) amortization schedule.
Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration.
  The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Responses to this posting must be submitted to andrew.smallwood@navy.mil in PDF format no later than January 4th, 2011.  Point of Contact:  Drew Smallwood, Contract Specialist, Phone (757) 341-0084.

<p>Bearing the Presidential moniker, the PMF Program is a flagship leadership development program at the entry level for advanced degree candidates. It was created more than three decades ago by Executive Order and has gone through many changes over the years.&nbsp;The PMF Program brings in graduate degree candidates from diverse educational backgrounds into the Federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Program is highly selective and competitive. In 2010, less than 900 applicants were selected as Finalists out of an applicant pool of nearly 9,000. After being deemed a Finalist, a prospective PMF must find a job in a participating Federal department or agency. If they successfully complete the requirements of the Program, PMFs can be noncompetitively converted to career civil service status at the end of the two-year period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program assessment process is undergoing significant changes to now include an in-person component to the selection. This component will strengthen the selection process and ensure a pool of high-caliber finalists.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new PMF assessment is a multi-hurdle process, with an online, un-proctored assessment serving as a pre-screen for all applicants, followed by a smarter, more manageable in-person assessment for 1,500 semi-finalists in four locations. The online assessment is a cost-effective method for screening an increasing number of applicants. The in-person assessment is a more resource intensive process, which puts semi-finalists through a day-long assessment consisting of individual presentations, group activities, and a proctored writing exercise. Performance is scored against a structured rubric by a three-assessor panel. Finalists will be identified based on a cut-off score of the assessment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>

Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-03-0736-B (include the dashes). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.12 requires prospective contractors to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov, in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Prospective contractors are not eligible for an award, if their ORCA information is not current. Additionally, prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.

This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. Per Refresh 14, any paper offer received after March 10, 2010 will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror.

<DESC>AIRTANKER BASE DESCRIPTION AND MASS FLOW METER OPERATIONS:

Airtanker Base Retardant Mixing Plants consists of the following components: Retardant Tank(s), Pump and Mass Flow Meter. These are connected to the distribution manifold which consists of appropriate valves, pipes, and hoses leading to the fill port of the aircraft. 

The fire retardant is an ammonium-based fertilizer blended with thickeners, colorants and corrosion inhibitors to meet the requirements of the Lot Acceptance, Quality Assurance, and Field Quality Control for Fire Retardant Chemicals, NFES 1245 ( http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/fire/wfcs/laqa.htm ).  Retardant
is stored at the Airtanker Base either as fluid concentrate which is blended with water on demand, or as a completed product (previously mixed from a powder).  The Mass Flow Meters are only used for metering the final product to the aircraft, they are not used in the mixing process (except that they continually check to assure the density of the product remains within limits).  The retardant (either type) is delivered to the aircraft at a rate of 450 gallons per minute.  The Mass Flow Meters must have the capability to display the number of pounds delivered and instantaneous density of the mixed product. Loading of an aircraft will take between 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the airtanker. 

 Retardant Loading Operation. The totalizer on the meter is reset to zero.  The loading hose is connected to the aircraft. Tanker base personnel (one at the pump and one at the aircraft) coordinate the loading process.  The retardant flows through the mass flow meter.  At fluid concentrate bases a sample of retardant is taken to verify ammonium salt content of the blended product. Adjustments to the blending are made as necessary based on the measurement(s) of the sample taken. Loading is stopped by shutting down the pump and waiting a moment before closing the end of hose valve (at the aircraft) to avoid fluid hammer. The hose is disconnected from the aircraft. At the mass flow meter a ticket is sent the printer. The ticket contains the following information: date, time, average density and total number of pounds.

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

(ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request. 
(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause. 
(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price. 
(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase. 
(d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.

(c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within 2 days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor's intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons.

Background<br />AIR 4.4.5 Power &amp; Energy Division has oversight responsibilities on the F/A-18 A/D Generator Converter Unit (GCU), aka. Generator. The Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) Module is the highest failing device within the GCU. Some of the SCR Modules exhibit intermittent operational performance that is often hard to isolate and to remove from the Generator. These modules operate normally at low temperatures (approx. room temperature), fail under high temperatures (higher than 150 deg F), and will once again operate at low temperatures when allowed to cool. We shall refer to these modules as "Bad Actors". When such SCR Modules are not isolated and removed during the repair process, it negatively impacts GCU reliability.
<p>AIR 4.4.5 Power and Energy Division has identified Fifty (50) Bad Actor SCR Modules for study. AIR 4.4.5 will make supporting data, documentation, and access to test systems available to the contractor, upon request following contract award. <br />Under this Statement of Work (SOW), the contractor shall insure the following requirements indentified below are met.</p>

The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverable listed in the schedule.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

VA HANDBOOK 6500.6
APPENDIX C

1.	GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
2.	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a.	A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d.	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e.	The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractors employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a.	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b.	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractors information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VAs information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VAs sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
c.	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
d.	The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e.	The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold
payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
g.	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
h.	The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
i.	The contractor/subcontractors firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VAs minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
j.	Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VAs prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
k.	Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l.	For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a.	The term security incident means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b.	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractors
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident
(including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or
compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
5. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-days notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

<a href="mailto:tejae.craig@conus.army.mil">MICC Center - YPG</a>
<DESC>AMENDMENT - 0002.  This amendment to the solicitation for System Safety Engineering and Range Support Services (SSERSS) at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG), AZ is issued to address questions and recommendations received from industry.  As a result the following changes are made to the solicitation.<BR><BR>a.   The NAICS code is changed from 541330 "Engineering Services" with a size standard of $4.5M to 541330 "Engineering Services - Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons" with a size standard of $27M.  <BR>QUESTIONS<BR><BR>1. Attachment 7 Historical Workload are these numbers of hours worked or tasks performed? Answer: They are number of hours worked.<BR><BR>2. OCONUS travel and work will the contractor be required to buy Defense Base Act (DBA) Insurance? Answer: FAR clause 52.228-3 and 52.228-4 will be incorporated into Attachment 4 (Clauses and Provisions) of the solicitation.  Task orders will specify OCONUS work as required and if required DBA insurance will be needed. <BR><BR>3. TDY to Cold Regions Test Center at Fort Greely, Alaska will the government provide Cold Weather Clothing or must the contractor provide? Answer: The Government will provide the cold weather clothing.<BR><BR>4. Reference Attachment 2, C.1.3. Duty Station states that the primary duty station is at USAYPG, Arizona.   Given that the government site support may be intermittent in nature; can the work in the PWS be performed at the contractor site location? Answer: Partial work on the might be completed at the contractor site,  however, work will also be required at USAYPG.  In addition, temporary 'safari' mission requirements to various OCONUS locations may be required in accordance with the PWS.  Specific taskings will identify work locations required.<BR><BR>5. Reference Attachment 4, Proposal Submission Instructions, Volume 1, Technical Proposal, Tab 3, Employee Recruitment and Retention.  If the response to question 4 above is "yes, work can be performed at the contractor site," then is this proposal section still relevant and required? Answer: Yes, proposal section in Attachment 4, Proposal Submission Instructions Volume 1, Technical Proposal, Tab 3, Employee Recruitment and Retention is still relevant and required.    Engineering recruitment and retention is an important element of this requirement regardless of location.  <BR><BR>6. The RFQ appears to be very restrictive and addresses specific software utilization and maintenance that may allow only the incumbent contractor to be qualified. How will MICC address this issue, and how can the contractor be assured of a fair opportunity to compete for this procurement if no one but the incumbent can meet the stated solicitation requirements?  Answer:   The Government has invested in the development of this software and the Government owns it.  The requirement now is to maintain and upgrade the software.<BR><BR>7. The PWS states that "the organization should have 10 years of knowledge in providing services to organizations/agencies similar to or greater than the USAYPG effort." The only organization that has 10 years of experience in the specific areas of the RFQ is the incumbent; how would it be possible for any other company to qualify, or is the intent for this RFQ to be allocated as a "sole-source/no other qualified source" award? Answer:   No, it is not the intent of the Government to allocate this requirement as a 'sole source/no other qualified source' award.  This section of the PWS has been revised to clarify this requirement further and also include key personnel requirements. <BR><BR>8. The labor allocation specified in the CLIN structure indicates a low full time equivalent (FTE) utilization rate. The current scope only includes "non-personal services required to perform programmatic support in the areas of computer automated support for the RTSS and the SDZ Calculator, and special safety analyses/studies, on an as needed basis." The historical work load for 2010 indicates a labor loading of one FTE; how many FTEs are anticipated to be assigned to this project for the new contract?  Answer: The procurement will be conducted under a Requirements-type contract. Requirements will be issued through task orders on an as needed basis.  Burdened labor rates will be estimated in the contract and hours will be negotiated at the outset of the task order.<BR><BR>9. The scope is significantly smaller than anticipated, and does not include all of the elements previously covered under System Safety/Range Safety Support. How will these other topics (previously included in the scope) be address at YPG; will other contracts be placed for these areas of support? Answer: The areas of support besides System Safety & Engineering and Software Maintenance & Upgrades will be in-sourced or are no longer a requirement of the Government.  At this time, there are no contracts set in place for the other areas of support.<BR><BR> 	Task Area 1: System Safety and Engineering Support (Assumes that this scope includes the RFQ area of Special Analyses/Studies on an as needed basis; is this correct?) Answer: Yes<BR><BR> 	Task Area 2: Radiation Safety Support<BR><BR> 	Task Area 3: Range Safety Support<BR><BR> 	Task Area 4: Industrial Hygiene Services Support<BR><BR> 	Task Area 5: OSHA and Engineering Services Support<BR><BR> 	Task Area 6: Ammunition & Explosive Safety Support<BR><BR> 	Task Area 7: Software Maintenance and Upgrades Support (Assumes this scope includes the RFQ area of Computer Automated Systems support for the Range Test Scheduling System (RTSS) and the Safety Danger Zone (SDZ) Calculator; is this correct?) Answer: Yes<BR><BR> 	Task Area 8: Installation Safety Analysis Support<BR><BR> 	Task Area 9: Support to Other Test Centers and DoD Agencies Support<BR><BR> 	Task Area 10: Health Wellness Employee Support<BR><BR>10. If it is the intent of MICC to include these areas in the current RFQ, please identify the number of hours (on an annual basis) from the CLIN structure that could be anticipated for each of these Task Areas. Answer: The only areas of support are Software Maintenance & Upgrades and System Safety & Engineering.  All work will be issued on task orders on an as needed basis.  Estimates provided in the solicitation are for the purposes of evaluating offers.<BR><BR>11. Given the low level of labor loading, how much (if any) of the work is to be performed on site? Answer: The procurement will be conducted under a Requirements-type contract.  Taskings will be issued under task orders as required and will identify work location.  The work may require partial performance at the Contractor's site; however work will also be required to be performed at USAYPG i.e. the Special Analyses/Studies function may require an engineeer to be present at either USAYPG, CRTC or TRTC whenever an incident occurs to conduct investigations.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

(b) Any bid that does not conform to the applicable specifications shall be rejected unless the invitation authorized the submission of alternate bids and the supplies offered as alternates meet the requirements specified in the invitation. (c) Any bid that fails to conform to the delivery schedule or permissible alternates stated in the invitation shall be rejected. (d) A bid shall be rejected when the bidder imposes conditions that would modify requirements of the invitation or limit the bidders liability to the Government, since to allow the bidder to impose such conditions would be prejudicial to other bidders. For example, bids shall be rejected in which the bidder (1) Protects against future changes in conditions, such as increased costs, if total possible costs to the Government cannot be determined; (2) Fails to state a price and indicates that price shall be price in effect at time of delivery; (3) States a price but qualifies it as being subject to price in effect at time of delivery; (4) When not authorized by the invitation, conditions or qualifies a bid by stipulating that it is to be considered only if, before date of award, the bidder receives (or does not receive) award under a separate solicitation; (5) Requires that the Government is to determine that the bidders product meets applicable Government specifications; or (6) Limits rights of the Government under any contract clause. (e) A low bidder may be requested to delete objectionable conditions from a bid provided the conditions do not go to the substance, as distinguished from the form, of the bid, or work an injustice on other bidders.

(f) Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines in writing that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well. (g) Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items or subline items are materially unbalanced (see 15.404-1(g)). (h) Bids received from any person or concern that is suspended, debarred, proposed for debarment or declared ineligible as of the bid opening date shall be rejected unless a compelling reason determination is made (see Subpart 9.4). (i) Low bids received from concerns determined to be not responsible pursuant to subpart 9.1 shall be rejected (but if a bidder is a small business concern, see 19.6 with respect to certificates of competency).<BR><BR>In no event shall any understanding, agreement, contract modification, change order, or other matter made between the Contractor and a person other than the Contracting Officer in deviation from the terms of this contract be effective or binding upon the Government. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event that the Contractor makes any changes at the discretion of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in the costs incurred as a result thereof.<BR><BR>52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984) The Government Contemplates award of a Fixed Price Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation.

<p>(1) Experience and Expertise of Proposed Staff (40 Points) - the offeror's staff will be evaluated based on descriptions of key roles and submitted resumes and "Letters of Commitment" illustrating an appropriate skill mix; and experience of key staff and other proposed technical, management, and project support staff;<br /><br />(2) Corporate Capabilities and Past Performance (50 Points) - This criterion refers to the offeror's corporate resources and capabilities and performance results (outcomes) of similar tasks for the NIH or in other government contract efforts of similar magnitude. These contracts and projects must have been completed within the past three (3) years or currently in progress for services similar to the requirements specified in the Statement of Work.

The Contracting Officer will make a unilateral written determination (subject to the Disputes Clause, FAR 52.233-1), within 30 days of written notice, as to exclusion validity. The Government retains the right to unilaterally set the price for exclusion items in the event an agreement on price cannot be reached. The Contractor's delivery obligation shall resume upon receipt of the Contracting Officer's determination.</p>
<p>4.4.4 The Government will not be liable for any amount expended by the Contractor in excess of the applicable firm fixed price reflected in the schedule unless prior written authorization has been given by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>5.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE PROVISIONS.</p>

<p>Volume I- Technical Quote shall contain (1) copy of the company Quality Control Manual, Past Performance, &amp; Delivery time in days for the repairs for each line item.</p>
<p>Volume II- Price Quote shall include the proposed pricing information IAW the attached Price Quote Spreadsheet.<br />The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) provisions apply:<br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (Apr 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)</p>

Vendors must pass this evaluation in order to be further considered for contract award.<br />This evaluation will only be performed on vendors selected for possible contract award. Evaluation will be conducted and completed prior to contract award.<br />Evaluation Criteria: Only offerors successfully meeting the technical evaluation factors listed above will be considered for possible award and evaluated in the following areas. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following criteria in descending order of importance: delivery, past performance (relevant and recent) and price.<br />Delivery is the most important evaluation factor, with Past Performance being the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.<br />Delivery: The offer must include delivery information IAW the attached Statement of Work.

The total price evaluation will be for the Base and all four Option periods. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (AUG-2009), <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Anticipated date of award is 31 October 2010.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC><p>MSC will be issuing a Request for Quotations (RFQ)&nbsp;for the following services:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Background</p>
<p>MSC is investigating the elimination of various obsolete Sound Powered Telephone Circuits, voice amplified circuits and other Internal Communication Circuits on the T-ARS Class vessels. The intent is to remove those systems that are no longer needed using TRANSALT instructions that pertain to all four ships of the class. Obvious obsolete systems include the Light Machine Gun Circuit, the Captain's Battle Circuit, and the remnants of a Voice Tube System. Removal of these systems will provide much needed space for habitability improvements as well as the anticipated increases in cable space for future system upgrades, such as the new Machinery Control System (MCCS) project. Particular attention is being focused on the main deck area, port side, frames 27 through 40, where extensive changes to crew staterooms are planned for improved habitability. This research will also document the SP circuits required by ABS, USCG, and MSC/MSFSC Instructions and Regulations. The Contractor must ensure any ABS rules for communication systems will be followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The requirements of this task include review of the existing system IC drawings and referenced manuals, observation of new work planned as part of the habitability improvements on vessels, the upcoming installation of a new Machinery Control System, consulting and advising the MSC TPOC on modifications and document regulatory approvals as required; providing feedback for transalt approvals, and providing updated documentation in the format of an MSC work item with drawing updates.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), China Lake, CA intends to issue a modification to extend the period of performance on an existing contract on an other than full and open competition basis.  The contract is for System Configuration Set (SCS) support for the Marine Corps H-1 aircraft.  This action will extend the period of performance of the current contract from  2 Mar 11 through NTE 2 March 12.  There will be no increase to the level of effort or dollar value of the contract.  An SCS is a combination of software and hardware configuration items (CIs) that are integrated into a previously deployed baseline configuration and are delivered to the Fleet as highly integrated software and hardware packages.
  Delivery is FOB destination.  Delivery schedules are identified for each SCS.  As the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the AH-1 and UH-1 aircraft, Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. is the only source qualified to satisfy this requirement.  Bell has the unique integration capability needed to perform this effort and ensure compatibility between software and hardware systems due to ongoing changes, upgrades, and enhancements.  No solicitation will be issued; however, any firms believing that they can fulfill the requirement may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing its ability to do so without causing programmatic hardships.
  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Responses and requests shall be submitted by email to rowena.geyer@navy.mil or to Commander, Code 254100D (R. Geyer), NAVAIR WD, 429 E. Bowen Rd, MS 4015, China Lake, CA  93555-6108.

<ARCHDATE>03012011
<CONTACT>Tara Borntreger 202-263-9210
<DESC>The draft technical performance specification for the Hybrid Electric Drive for Backfit on the DDG 51 is now available by following the Technical Data Package (TDP) link on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website,
https://www.neco.navy.mil/ under solicitation number N0002411R4207.  It is also noted that this draft TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION FOR DDG 51 HED - EPS PRODUCTION HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT has several requirements that are yet to be defined or specified, noted as TBDs on the document, and ranges of possible values are indicated where known.  The Navy is interested in feedback on this draft technical performance specification in areas that would drive in cost or otherwise add requirements that could be eliminated without detrimental impact to performance.
  The opportunity for providing that feedback can take the form of a written response or be discussed during the one-on-one meetings described during the November 17, 2010 Industry Day.  These sessions are planned for January 2011 and arrangement for a 2-hour time slot can be made by contacting Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil or by calling 202-781-2629.  The previously released draft Request for Proposal package may contain contradictions to this draft technical performance specification since it had been written to accommodate the numerous requirements options as presented at the Industry Day and the final RFP and technical performance specification will include all requirements.
  Other documents may also be posted under this TDP Link in the future. All questions or comments should be directed to Tara Borntreger by email at tara.borntreger@navy.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for OPNAV, N135, Millington, TN.  This RFI concerns the Draft Standards for Elliptical Trainers and Stationary Cycles.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, or commitment of any kind by the U.S. Navy.  There will be no reimbursement or compensation provided for responding to this RFI.

DRAFT STANDARD FOR ELLIPTICAL TRAINERS


BACKGROUND

The U.S. Navy currently allows use of an elliptical trainer as one testing mode for aerobic capacity in its semiannual Physical Readiness Test (PRT).  The test is administered as follows:  The test-taker is given a suitable opportunity to warm up prior to testing.
  This warm-up may take place on the trainer or somewhere else prior to getting on the trainer.  The test then consists of a 12-minute exercise bout on the trainer at a resistance and pedaling speed of the test-takers choosing.  At the end of the bout, the number of kilocalories expended is recorded and used in conjunction with the test-takers weight to predict an equivalent 1.5-mile run time.  The twelve minute test period may be changed at some future date.
The Navy Physical Readiness Program desires that elliptical trainers used for testing be interchangeable so that equivalent performances on any trainer lead to equivalent run time predictions.  One way to achieve this goal is to standardize the accuracy with which kilocalories expended are estimated from braking force/power at the flywheel.
  This performance standard defines machine parameters for elliptical trainers that will lead to such equivalent performances.


GENERAL

To qualify for Navy PRT use, 
1.	The elliptical trainer must be constructed and operate in conformance with ISO Standards 20957-1 and 20957-9 (EN-957-1 & EN-957-9).  
2.	The elliptical trainer must conform to usage class S, professional and/or commercial use.
3.	The elliptical trainer must provide a speed-dependent exercise mode in which a fixed braking power is provided and the work performed varies with the stride frequency.
4.	The elliptical trainer must provide moveable handlebars in addition to the foot-platform pedals as a means of applying exercise torque to the flywheel.
5.	The elliptical trainer must not have a variable incline, or if the elliptical trainer is equipped with a variable incline, the incline is set in a pre-defined angle during the test and the controls for adjusting the incline are disabled.
  The user will not be allowed to alter the angle of the variable incline once the test begins.  At the beginning of the test, the variable incline is set to a pre-determined angle that provides accurate calorie counting for the effort.
6.	The elliptical trainer must not have a variable stride length.   The fixed stride length must be between 18.0 and 21.5 inches. 
7.	The elliptical trainer must have an accurate calorie counter.  The standard for accuracy is the agreement of the calories reported by the elliptical trainer with calories calculated from measured rates of oxygen consumption during exercise on the device.  A validation study must be conducted to demonstrate suitable accuracy of the elliptical trainer calorie counts.
  An elliptical trainer will be deemed suitably accurate if (1) the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression of measured calories on device-indicated calories includes the value 1, and (2) the difference between the mean value of the measured calories and the mean value of the indicated calories lie in the range of -2 to +2 kcal for a 12 minute period.  Parameters of the validation study are: (1) it must include at least 75 comparisons of measured and indicated calories, (2) the measurements must be distributed over the range of 100 to 350 kilocalories in 12min, and (3) recording of measured calories can only be made after at least 3 minutes of exercise at the chosen load. This is done to allow the rate of oxygen consumption to stabilize at that load.
8.	The validation study must be conducted by an outside agent, not by the elliptical trainer manufacturer.


TEST OPERATION

The elliptical trainer needs to support a test in which the test duration (currently 12:00 min) can be entered at the console at the start of the test.
  A start button is pressed and energy expenditure in calories is accumulated for the specified time. At the end of the specified time period, the number of calories expended is saved and held on the display, and the test participant is allowed to continue pedaling to cool down.  Calories expended during warm-up or cool down are not added to the calories expended during the test. Specific requirements are:
1.	The test participant must be able to vary the resistance and stride rate during the test and during warm-up and cool down periods.
2.	The elliptical trainer needs to provide at least 450W of braking power at the input crank shaft.
3.	The elliptical trainer needs to have a timer function to provide a fixed-duration exercise test.
  Warm-up periods shall not be included in the Navy Test. Timing should be accurate to the nearest 0.5 second.  The test can allow for warm up with a prompt Press Start to begin the test?
4.	A button (or other control) to begin the Navy Test needs to be provided.  This can be a dedicated button labeled Navy Test, or can it be a multi-function button with Navy Test as one of the options?  Pressing this button should reset the machine, put the elliptical in speed-dependent mode and prompt the user (either test-taker or test administrator) to enter the test duration in minutes and seconds and body weight in pounds to the nearest whole pound.
5.	Test time and body weight (to the nearest whole pound) must remain locked and displayed until the button to begin the test is pressed.
  This allows the test administrator to confirm the entries.
6.	A clearly marked Begin Test button (or other control) must be provided on the console. This button can be a dedicated button labeled Begin Test, or can it be a button labeled Quick Start with a prompt in the display stating Press Quick Start to begin test, or some similar prompt.  It should be placed so that either the test-taker or the test administrator can actuate it.  
7.	Once the Begin Test button has been pushed, the elliptical trainer display must indicate cumulative kilocalories expended during the test to the nearest whole kilocalorie. The trainer must also provide a continuous display of the elapsed time in minutes and seconds to the nearest second, the resistance level and the stride rate or revolutionmin-1 (RPM) to the nearest RPM.
   Body weight in pounds must be displayed at the end of the test for test administrator.
8.	The elliptical trainer needs to calculate, update and display the sum of the kilocalories expended during the exercise bout at a rate of at least 1 samplesecond-1.  At any time, the sum displayed must be the cumulative sum of all calories expended rounded to the nearest whole kilocalorie excluding kilocalories expended during warm-up and cool-down.
9.	The elliptical trainer needs to retain and display the cumulative kilocalories and the body weight at the end of the timed exercise bout. These values must remain fixed on the display while the machine allows the test participant to continue striding, even at a different stride rate and/or resistance for a cool down.
10.	The accumulated kilocalories, the body weight (lb) and the test time should remain on the display until cleared by the test operator.
11.	The clock must run continuously from the beginning until the end of the test period even if the test taker stops exercising.
  The calories displayed will be the total for the specified test period, including the stopped interval.  If the machine is self-powered, the display must remain on at least 1 minute following the cessation of exercise by the test-taker.
12.	A test interrupt function needs to be provided to allow either the test-taker or the test administrator to stop the test prior to the finish.  If interrupted, the calories are not saved or displayed.
13.	At the end of the test, a button (or other control) needs to be provided to clear the display and provide a prompt to perform another test or quit testing, or return to the menu from which the test is launched.
14.	Indicating the intent to conduct another test should clear the display and prompt for test duration and body weight again.
15.	Indicating that testing is at an end should clear the display and put the elliptical trainer back in its basic start up mode.
16.	There shall be no indication on the elliptical trainer from the manufacturer that it is approved for the U.S.
 Navy test.
17.	The elliptical trainer shall not contain an algorithm to predict a run time or Navy PRT score from calorie expenditure.  Navy prediction models are subject to change, and differences in precision between the onboard processor and the Navy calculation methods lead to results that do not match Navy calculations closely enough.


DRAFT STANDARD FOR STATIONARY CYCLES

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Navy currently allows use of a stationary cycle as one testing mode for aerobic capacity in its semiannual Physical Readiness Test (PRT).  The test is administered as follows:  The test-taker is given a suitable opportunity to warm up prior to testing.  This warm-up may take place on the cycle or somewhere else prior to getting on the cycle.
  The test then consists of a 12-minute exercise bout on the cycle at a resistance and pedaling speed of the test-takers choosing.  At the end of the bout, the number of kilocalories expended is recorded and used in conjunction with the test-takers weight to predict an equivalent 1.5-mile run time.  The twelve minute test period may be changed at some future date.

The Navy Physical Readiness Program desires that stationary cycles used for testing be interchangeable so that equivalent performances on any trainer lead to equivalent run time predictions.  One way to achieve this goal is to standardize the accuracy with which kilocalories expended are estimated from braking force/power at the flywheel.
  This performance standard attempts to define performance parameters for stationary cycles that will lead to such equivalent performances.


GENERAL 

To qualify for Navy PRT use, 
1.	The stationary cycle must be constructed and operate in conformance with ISO Standards 20957-1 and 20957-5 (EN-957-1 & EN-957-5).  
2.	The stationary cycle must conform to usage class S, professional and/or commercial use.
3.	The stationary cycle must provide a speed-dependent training mode in which a fixed braking power is provided and the work performed varies with the pedaling frequency.
4.	The stationary cycle must have an accurate calorie counter.  The standard for accuracy is the agreement of the calories reported by the stationary cycle with calories calculated from measured rates of oxygen consumption during exercise on the device.
  A validation study must be conducted to demonstrate suitable accuracy of the stationary cycle calorie counts.  A stationary cycle will be deemed suitably accurate if (1) the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression of measured calories on device-indicated calories includes the value 1, and (2) the difference between the mean value of the measured calories and the mean value of the indicated calories lie in the range of -2 to +2 kcal for a 12 minute period.  Parameters of the validation study are: (1) it must include at least 75 comparisons of measured and indicated calories, (2) the measurements must be distributed over the range of 50 to 200 kilocalories in 12min, and (3) recording of measured calories can only be made after at least 3 minutes of exercise at the chosen load.
 This is done to allow the rate of oxygen consumption to stabilize at that load.
5.	The validation study must be conducted by an outside agent, not by the stationary cycle manufacturer.


TEST OPERATION

The stationary cycle needs to support a test in which the test duration (currently 12:00 minutes) and body weight in pounds are entered at the console.  A start button is pressed and energy expenditure in calories is accumulated for the specified time. At the end of the specified time period, the number of calories expended is saved and held on the display, and the test participant is allowed to continue pedaling to cool down.  Calories expended during cool down are not added to the calories expended during the test.
 Specific requirements are:
1.	The test participant must be able to vary the resistance and RPM during the test and any cool down after the test.
2.	The stationary cycle needs to provide at least 450W of braking power.
3.	The stationary cycle needs to have a timer function to provide a fixed-duration exercise test.  Warm-up periods shall not be included in the Navy Test. Timing should be accurate to the nearest 0.5 second.
4.	A button (or other control) to begin the Navy Test needs to be provided.  Pressing this button should reset the machine, put the cycle in speed-dependent mode and prompt the user (either test-taker or test administrator) to enter the test duration in minutes and seconds and body weight in pounds.
5.	Test time and body weight (to the nearest whole pound) must remain displayed until the button to begin the test is pressed.
  This allows the test administrator to confirm the entries.
6.	A clearly marked Begin Test button (or other control) must be provided on the console.  It should be placed so that either the test-taker or the test administrator can actuate it.  
7.	Once the Begin Test button has been pushed, the stationary cycle display must indicate cumulative kilocalories expended during the test to the nearest whole kilocalorie. The trainer must also provide a continuous display of the elapsed time in minutes and seconds to the nearest second, body weight in pounds, the resistance level and the pedaling rate to the nearest revolutionmin-1. 
8.	The stationary cycle needs to calculate, update and display the sum of the kilocalories expended during the exercise bout at a rate of at least 1 samplesecond-1.
  At any time, the sum displayed must be the cumulative sum of all calories expended rounded to the nearest whole kilocalorie.
9.	The stationary cycle needs to retain and display the cumulative kilocalories and the body weight at the end of the timed exercise bout. These values must remain fixed on the display while the machine allows the test participant to continue pedaling, even at a different stride rate and/or resistance for a cool down.
10.	The accumulated kilocalories, the body weight (lb) and the test time should remain on the display until cleared by the test operator.
11.	If the test taker stops exercising, the clock must continue to run until the end of the test period.  The calories displayed will be the total for the test period, including the stopped interval.
12.	A test interrupt function needs to be provided to allow either the test-taker or the test administrator to stop the test prior to the finish.
  If interrupted, the calories are not saved or displayed.
13.	At the end of the test, a button (or other control) needs to be provided to clear the display and provide a prompt to perform another test or quit testing.
14.	Indicating the intent to conduct another test should clear the display and prompt for test duration and body weight again.
15.	Indicating that testing is at an end should clear the display and put the stationary cycle back in its basic start up mode.
16.	There shall be no indication on the stationary cycle from the manufacturer that it is approved for the U.S. Navy test.
17.	The stationary cycle shall not contain an algorithm to predict a run time or Navy PRT score from calorie expenditure.
  Navy prediction models are subject to change, and differences in precision between the onboard processor and the Navy calculation methods lead to results that do not match Navy calculations closely enough.
