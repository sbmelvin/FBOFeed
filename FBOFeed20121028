<DESC><p>Amendment 0001 to the Eglin AFB solicitation SPE600-12-R-0827 is hereby posted to revise the original solicitation posting date and to establish a cut-off date for questions to be submitted regarding the solicitation, Preproposal Conference and Site Visits.&nbsp; <br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://sam.gov/</span>.<br /><br />If you are registered in CCR, once you click on the secured document link in the FBO, it should prompt you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form, in order to complete the Joint Certification Program (JCP) certification. All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well.&nbsp; DLA Energy has been advised that it has been taking 2-3 months for JCP certification to be complete.<br /><br />Vendors must also request and be approved for explicit access to each solicitation in order to view the secure packages.<br /></p>
