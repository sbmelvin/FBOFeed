<p>Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) Contractor to support Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs)</p>
<p>The Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to maintain the Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) front-end application for all four Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) claims processing contractors.</p>
<p>Currently, the CEDI front-end system provides a single front-end solution for the submission and retrieval of electronic transactions. Trading Partners submit X12 Version 5010 837 claims and 276 Claim Status Inquiry transactions and NCPDP Version D.0 transactions to CEDI.  CEDI performs all front-end edits on these transactions, assigns the Claim Control Number (CCN) to claims accepted by CEDI, and creates the flat files for delivery to the appropriate DME MAC.  X12 837 claims accepted by CEDI are delivered to the appropriate DME MAC based on the beneficiary state code and 276 files are delivered based on the contractor code in the header record of the file.  CEDI returns all electronic front-end reports as well as the X12 835 Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA), 277 Claims Status Response, X12 999 Implementation Acknowledgment For Health Care Insurance (for X12 version 5010A1 837 and version 5010 276 transactions), TA1 Interchange Acknowledgement (for X12 version 5010A1 837 and version 5010 276 transactions if requested), and X12 277 Claim Acknowledgement (for X12 version 5010A1 837 transactions) to the Trading Partner's CEDI mailbox</p>
<p>CEDI performs NCPDP front-end edits, assigns the CCN to accepted claims, creates flat files for delivery to the appropriate DME MAC based on the beneficiary state code, and returns the NCPDP Transmission Response Transaction for NCPDP version D.0 claims.</p>
<p>The CEDI DME MAC front-end system shall not be integrated with any other commercial application or processing environment. The primary functions of the CEDI DME MAC front-end system generally will include: <br /> <br />&bull;	Hosting the CMSnet MLPS (Multi Level Protocol System) connectivity to receive claims and claims related electronic transactions claims 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except during planned downtime for system maintenance<br />&bull;	An electronic mailbox system for suppliers to retreive claims 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except during planned downtime for system maintenance, as well as offer customer support; <br />&bull;	EDI translation and front end editing activities for all ANSI ASC X12  and NCPDP versions as adopted by Federal regulation promulgated by DHHS and/or CMS, using Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software;<br />&bull;	EDI translation and front end activities for the following adopted formats:<br />&bull;	X12 version 5010A1 837 claims<br />&bull;	X12 version 5010A1 835 electronic remittance advice<br />&bull;	X12 version 5010 276 claim status request<br />&bull;	X12 version 5010 277 claim status response<br />&bull;	NCPDP version 5.1 claims<br />&bull;	NCPDP version D.0 claims<br />&bull;	X12 and NCPDP transaction routing;<br />&bull;	Connectivity support for EDI users;<br />&bull;	Trading Partners/Providers/Suppliers EDI enrollment; <br />&bull;	Free Billing Software (FBS) distribution and support; <br />&bull;	Submitter profile changes and updates;<br />&bull;	Transaction testing; <br />&bull;	EDI helpdesk support; <br />&bull;	Education and Outreach material for external users (e.g. DME MAC and Trading Partners/Providers/Suppliers).</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this requirement an offeror must:</p>
<p>&bull;	Be able to demonstrate their experience with the VMS shared system claims processing environment.</p>
<p>&bull;	Currently process DME claims for adjudication and payment in an active production EDI environment.</p>
<p>There are no exceptions to the requirements listed under the first two bullet points; offerors who do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration.</p>
<p>&bull;	Possess, at the minimum, Capability Maturity Model&reg; Integration (CMMI) Level II accreditation at contract award.  The offeror must be able to achieve CMMI Level III accreditation before contract option year 2.</p>
<p>&bull;	Be able to determine the best approach for transitioning the single front-end application for DME processing (approximately 77,302,091 annual claims) from the current CEDI system.</p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS BEST VIEWED ON THE FAA CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES WEB SITE: HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV. In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1, this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of obtaining information on capabilities, to determine competition, and estimated costs associated with manufacturing  a network-enabled Visibility and/or network-enabled  Precipitation Liquid Water Equivalent (LWE) prototype sensor.  These sensors must be capable of organically supporting network communication without the need for adapters or the like while also meeting the specifications and capabilities identified in this market survey.  Background:  The surface weather sensor network that provides aviation weather observations to today's National Airspace System (NAS) users is comprised of a collection of independent systems that were fielded over time to satisfy weather observation requirements that have evolved or emerged since the early 1980s.  After almost three decades since the first ground-based weather observation automation system was put in service, the observation network is now comprised of several independent observing systems, and independent systems that serve as backups to primary observing systems, whose engineering designs employ point to point communication protocols to proprietary processors that output specific observation parameters.  While this approach satisfied the focused requirements associated with each system, an examination of the entire network of capabilities exposes opportunities for greater efficiency and improved observational benefits.  For instance, today's observation systems do not easily support either the optimal siting of sensors, the sharing or leveraging of sensor information, or the addition of sensors to support the emergence of new observing requirements without costly and complex hardware and software changes.  As the FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative leverages net centric communication paradigms, the opportunity exists to examine the modernization of the sensor network to maximize benefit and efficiencies and support legacy and advanced applications. This is NOT a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP); the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA desires information and documentation regarding the modification of weather sensor design to directly support (without adaptation equipment) network communication protocols.  To interface effectively with NextGen net-centric principles, sensor communication technologies must evolve to include secure, network type communication channels.  The Government is seeking information from prospective companies/vendors to decide whether or not a weather sensor design that directly supports (without adaptation equipment) network communication protocols can be accomplished.  Interested vendors that have the capabilities to meet these requirements should provide sufficient information to describe those items and capabilities in a compelling manner.  Submitted documentation must clearly demonstrate that the vendor can meet the following requirements: Sensor Types and Capabilities specifications are as follows: 	Visibility Sensor - 0 to 10mi minimum accuracy of +/- 10% from 50ft to 5mi and +/- 20% from 5mi to 10mi and a resolution of 50ft Present Weather/Precipitation ID - reports R-, R, R+, S-, S, S+, DZ-, DZ ,DZ+, GR, GS 	Precipitation Liquid Water Equivalent - 30 inch capacity minimum accuracy of +/- .01in and resolution of .001in. Core Capabilities:  Prospective companies/vendors must possess knowledge, capabilities, and experience in the following areas: 	Surface Weather Sensor manufacturing, quality control, certification  	Deployment and maintenance of weather sensors into the NAS environment 	Knowledge of FAA weather sensors, weather formats, and the integration of weather sensor information into air traffic management systems Sensor Design Specification:  The Sensor Processing and Communications hardware shall support Ethernet and TCP/IP. This type of interface will allow the sensor to communicate directly via modern communications networks without the need for any kind of adapter. The sensor shall provide TCP/IP interface capable of providing both a command Mode and Data Mode communications. Both the command Mode and Data Mode shall be accessed via a unique port number. The Sensor shall provide a separate listener for both the Command and Data Mode, based on the unique port numbers. If the command mode is activated while the data mode is active, the connectivity to the data mode shall be terminated (only one mode shall be active at any one time).  Both the command mode and data mode data shall be encapsulated within a TCP/IP frame. In addition to the interface the modified sensor design will also need to supply 48V DC at 100mA in a Power-Over-Internet cable to support operation of the network communications equipment.  Electronics enclosures should be rated NEMA 4 or NEMA 4 X. The sensor design and core capabilities provided are intended to provide enough information to the FAA to distinguish if a vendor is capable of providing a sensor that has the configuration that is capable of organically supporting network communication without the need for adapters or the like while still satisfying the sensor requirements.  Interested vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture the visibility and/or LWE sensors to meet the requirements should provide sufficient information to describe those items and capabilities in a compelling manner.  Submitted documentation must clearly demonstrate that the vendor can produce a visibility and/or LWE sensor specified in this market survey.  Submissions provided to the Government must address the following: 1. Capability Statement that addresses the following: a.	Engineering feasibility of providing a network interface as specified above. b.	Type of services or products provided by your firm that demonstrate ability to perform the services described above. c.	Services or products provided under previous contracts to enable the measurement of weather information that are similar in size, scope and complexity to this effort.  d.	Provide detailed information and past performance information for previous contracts including program title, customer name, project dates, project value, customer point of contact, and description of work performed. 2.  Estimated Cost breakout (to be used for budgetary purposes) as follows: a.	Prototype Cost for a Visibility and/or LWE sensor b.	Non-recurring Engineering Costs c.	Overhead/General  & Administrative Costs 3. Vendor's ability to provide a prototype Visibility and/or LWE sensor within a 3 month period. 4. Vendor's ability to commence delivery of production of Visibility and/or LWE sensor within 8 months of the FAA's notice to proceed. 5.  Completed Business Declaration Form (attached).  Include a copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form and/or proof of service-disabled veteran-owned small business status, if applicable. Only those respondents providing the required documentation and found to meet the requirements in response to this market survey will be considered on any future action taken by the FAA.  Therefore, interested companies/vendors who can comply with this announcement are highly encouraged to respond. The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, with a size standard of 750 employees. It is the intention of the FAA to utilize non-government advisors, Basic Commerce and Industry (BCI) and Data Transformation Corp (DTC), for the technical evaluation of submissions for this market survey, and any future actions as a result of this announcement, as applicable.  All personnel participating in the evaluation will be required to sign Non-Disclosure and Conflict of Interest Agreements.  The exclusive responsibility for evaluating the market survey submissions remains with the FAA. Electronic submissions are required. Submissions must not exceed 20 pages total in length (page count is applicable to submissions 1-4 above).  The electronic submission should be in either Microsoft WORD format or portable document format (PDF).

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for the extension of the Raman Spectroscopy Measurements contract (NNC12CA21C) with Ohio Aerospace Institute (OAI) on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The Raman Spectroscopy Measurements contract began March 6, 2012 and is currently scheduled for completion on December 31, 2012.	NASA intends to extend the period performance for a potential nine month period. This extension will begin January 1, 2013 and end September 30, 2013.  The extension is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to ensure uninterrupted effort to NASA Glenn Research Center until a new contract is awarded. The current contractor, OAI, is considered the only capable contractor that can meet NASA/GRC needs given the short period of performance for this extension.  Additionally, competing the requirement for a period of up to nine months would not be possible given the end date of the current contract and the strict requirement of uninterrupted support. Awarding the potential nine month contract extension to another contractor at the same time that there is a competitive action in process to include this work would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that will not be recovered. The Government does not intent to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 28, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to continue work under contract NAS5-00136 with the Penn State University (PSU) for the additional effort of 1 year of Mission Operations (MO) and Data Analysis (DA) support for the Swift mission in order to maintain the health and safety of the observatory. NASA/GSFC plans to modify the Penn State University Cost-No-Fee (CNF) contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, with an estimated period of performance of three years. The key component of the proposed CNF contract is to provide optimum capabilities for the next breakthroughs in determining the origin of gamma-ray bursts and their afterglows, using bursts to probe the early universe, and performing the first sensitive hard x-ray survey of the sky.  This is accomplished via measurements made by the following instrument suite: the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), the Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) and the X-Ray Telescope (XRT). Swift, launched in November 2004, has already made significant discoveries and has provided NASA and the scientific community with significant data that has resulted in many published scientific papers. If properly maintained and operated, Swift should continue to provide the science community with data for years to come.  Consistency and stability of those providing mission operations, science data analysis, and ground systems engineering ensures observatory health and safety and continued Swift scientific productivity. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 28, 2012.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

No exceptions or qualifications. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No bids will be accepted from bidders proposing to use another firm?s GSA schedule, even if they have permission of the firm to use it.

For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.") <BR> <BR>Bid prices for EACH line item must be accurate, fair, and reasonable, as determined by the contracting officer, using competitive price comparisons, market research, etc. Bundling multiple line item prices together (?materially unbalanced? pricing) is NOT acceptable, unless that exact bundle is listed as a single CLIN on the bidder?s contract. Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items are materially unbalanced. Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well. <BR> <BR>

The design and fabrication will be based on an NSWC PCD performance specification with the goal of achieving increased availability and reduced life cycle cost, compared to the current fan. While the performance specification contains environmental and qualification tests  the Contractor will not be required to complete the environmental or qualification testing and these tests are not a condition for acceptance of the test articles.
 The Contractor will be required to perform a functional test of the scavenge fan prior to delivery. The Navy intends to perform independent qualification and operational testing of the fan test articles to be procured under these orders once delivered.

The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Infantry Weapons, Quantico, VA has a requirement for Fully Functional Foreign/US made Weapons.  The Government anticipates entering into a Firm Fixed Price contract. The estimated contract minimum is:

Qty 153 Rocket Propelled Grenade Launchers

Qty 20 7.62 x39mm RPG-7v Training Devices (i.e., sub-caliber trainers) to be purchased as a system with the Rocket Propelled Grenade Launchers.

The purpose of the Foreign Weapons Program is to procure a selection of fully functional foreign/US made-weapons to support classroom training so students can readily identify and render safe for transport commonly encountered Foreign Weapon systems.
  Vendors systems shall be in new (i.e., unused) condition and shall include all parts, components, assemblies, subassemblies, and mechanisms inherent to the complete system designs. A proposal offering used weapons will not be evaluated on or for that system. The systems shall demonstrate fit, form, and function of fully operational systems. The Government recognizes that there are different variants, models, and countries of origin for the systems required. The Government will accept different variants/models of the systems identified above. 
Also, the Government will accept domestically manufactured FAL 7.62x51mm Light Automatic Assault Rifles and RPD 7.62X39mm Rifles, as long as they conform to the technical requirements called out in the product description.
 The Government recognizes additional documentation will be required to procure the Dragunov 7.62x54mm Sniper Rifles.  Vendors will be required to apply through the State Department for authorization where applicable when applying for importation of Russian/Soviet-made firearms. The systems shall conform to the technical requirements called out in the Product Descriptions that will be provided with the solicitation. Vendors proposed configurations shall be uniform for the entire quantity of systems to be provided (i.e., entire quantity of each system shall be of the same configuration, model, and country of origin).  Source Selection will be based on evaluation of Technical (Technical Capability), Past Performance, and Price factors.
 The Governments intent is to award one or more contracts to the responsible offerors with the lowest priced technically acceptable offers at the individual CLIN level, except for the Rocket Propelled Grenade Launchers (RPG-7V) and the RPG-7 Training Device. The RPG-7V and the RPG-7v Training Device will be evaluated as a complete system; i.e. they will not be evaluated as separate line items. Therefore, offerors who are unable or unwilling to offer on all CLINs, except for the RPG-7V and the RPG-7v Training Device, may propose and price to only those CLINs which they are willing and capable of delivering. The NAICS code for this procurement is 332994 and the size Standard is 1000 employees.
  In order to be eligible for award, interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (CCR).

Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the original solicitation. In case of conflicts between information contained in the formal solicitation and that contained in this pre-solicitation notice, the information in the formal solicitation will govern.

NOTE: WDTC IT certified network team from Data Sciences Division will be on hand to assist LNA in the assignment of all WDTC Test Network requirements and installation of Vista or Windows 7 integration onto these systems and any add-on requirements to bring these two new systems onto the WDTC test network.  <br>  <br> The requiring activity for this requirement is the West Desert Test Engineering & Integration Division. <br>  <br>  <br> Additional System Integration Requirements:  <br>  <br> This system is part of a required HIGH DEFINITION (HD) migration upgrade by interfacing these systems providing for a High Definition storage and runtime (HD) data processing capability. This Hardware shall  be delivered and installed by a qualified certified Matrox Vender and builder inside the Photonics Image Data Processing facility that is generally used to provide for High Definition Video HD data streaming and processing using several Matrox HD system solutions to support the WDTC-DPG Chem-BIO test mission.  These systems will be compatible to interface with an existing Rorke Data HD Galaxy X2 16 Bay and RAID5 system using an ATTO controller card and FiberJet software that will be provided as GFE.  <br> The Matrox Certified builder and vender must demonstrate and validate the delivered systems by processing numerous photonic data video streams in both the Standard Definition (SD and High Definition (HD) video support capability formats. The system will not be accepted until it has been demonstrated these systems can provide the full SD and HD processing capabilities and they are on line for migration shortly after delivery of these system. The systems will be of modular design to provide and operate inside a lab area or confined environment. All on board video storage space (4 TB) is required and available to process multiple SD and HD photonics video streams. Adequate storage space will be required to meet these requirements. The additional external storage (4 TB) for each system will also provide for a bridge support structure for the new Mobile Image processing System Mobile capability fielded in 2010 to provide for temporary storage for all raw and processed photonics SD and HD data video waiting to be processed. These systems also provide a temporary storage solution to archive all data as we continue the migration to the WDTC test network SAN and move away from costly optical disc and very large DLT tape.  <br>  <br> Systems shall be completely interfaced  with all existing SD and HD Image and video processing systems support still and multi-spectral image processing capabilities. These systems will become a COOP system in addition to a mirrored Rorke Data HD X2 16 Bay and RAID5 system to realize a High Definition HD need to process large volumes of HD video to generate high spatial resolution data products. This system is also considered to be a companion that will be interfaced to all existing Dell NAS systems installed inside the MIPS trailer. The vender and our IT department engineers will work closely together to interface these Matrox systems on the WDTC test network.  These two digital processes will be accessible on the WDTC test network using fiber optic cards and direct fiber optic connections.  <br>  <br> The new Matrox system toolset and hardware shall match all interface requirements that also minimizes all interface complications by using a Matrox certified system builder and vender to provide connections to the existing Rorke companion or Dell PowerVault NAS to provide for additional system storage. The Matrox MXO2LEMAX and HP Z820 systems may require some modification by the vender to meet the customized hardware and image processing application capability in maximizing the cooling controls inside the new HP Z820 system.  The vender is responsible for supplying, installing and integrating all cooling controls and hardware to meet the specification requirements to maintain a controlled operating temperature within the HP workstation.  <br>  <br> Some modifications may be required to retro fit this hardware with either our existing Rorke Data Galaxy HD X2 RAID5 systems. The integration of the new Matrox systems must be seamless to support this new capability.   Adobe Master Collection Suite CS6 is being provided as GFE. This software shall be installed by the Matrox Certified builder onto the HP Z820 systems and all suite software will be validated to control components and optional processes integrated within the Matrox MXO2LEMAX system.  Several SD and HD video streams will be processed on these systems by the vender to insure all applications are turn-key and operational before acceptance. These systems will be interfaced with an existing professional Sony video PDWHD1500 recording deck to insure all modifications and interfaces are operational to access SD and HD video streams and processing applications. The interface of choice is fiber optic, HD SDI or Firewire controls designed to migrate and grow with the HD capability. The vender to provide all necessary interfaces as needed to control the Matrox MXO2LEMAX interface with the HP Z820 to support our WDTC-DPG HD capability and the Chem-Bio Smoke Obscurants mission requirements.  <br>  <br>    Contractor must adhere to Army Regulations; AR 525-13, Antiterrorism and AR 530-1, Operations Security as described in section 8.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Rapid Payload Rideshare.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GSFC  is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses,	and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the payload rideshare acquisition.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This is a market research activity initiated by NASA GSFC, Sciences and Exploration Directorate (SED). The SED is conducting research to determine potential sources for rideshare opportunities for NASA GSFCs and its partners science and technology demonstration payloads. This will be a potential multiple-award contract for payload rideshare opportunities that includes services such as hosting, integration, launch and support of on-orbit operations of NASA GSFC and its partners payloads. NASA GSFC is intending to release a multiple award contract Request for Proposal (RFP) for procurement of rapid rideshare opportunities for NASA GSFC and its partners payloads by leveraging commercial launch opportunities and best practices. This activity is anticipated to be a potential multiple-award contract for payload rideshare opportunities that may includes services such as hosting, integration, launch and support of on-orbit operations of NASA GSFC and its partners payloads. The procurement strategy has not been finalized but NASA/GSFC is contemplating multiple Firm Fixed Price contracts where specific mission requirements will be competed amongst the awardees and an order awarded for that specific mission with applicable terms, conditions and requirements. Before posting the RFP, NASA GSFC is seeking comments from potential responders on the draft SOW. The attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) describes the details of this opportunity. It is important for prospective proposers to note that this multiple contract is intended to bring the costs down associated with the launch of individual payloads, and to maximize the frequency of launch of scientific and technology demonstration payloads. In addition to meeting mission requirements, cost will be an important factor in selecting successful vendor(s) who will respond to the proposed RFP and will provide the services. Identifying a not to exceed (NTE) price envelope for each class of rideshare opportunity (for example specified by mass and orbit), as well as a discount structure for multiple rideshare orders (within a given time frame) is proposed to be required when responding to this call (see section 4 of the Draft SOW).	 In particular NASA/GSFC is interested in soliciting comments from industry in the following areas; 1) How might a vendor meet the intent of these RFI documents using its own commercial practices? 2) From industry's perspective, what contract vehicle might allow us the most cost effective, rapid and flexible means of acquiring these services?  NASA GSFC is interested in your ideas. 3) What suggestions and consideration might NASA want to consider in its pricing structure?  How are discounts acquired in your commercial practice? 4) What programmatic and technical suggestions and considerations might NASA want to consider in order to help minimize the cost of future rideshare opportunities.	 Host contractors that consider themselves capable of providing the services in the SOW are asked to provide comments on this SOW. A statement of contractors capabilities must be accompanied with the comments on the SOW. A statement of capabilities must include: 1.	Company name, address, point of contact name, phone number, e-mail address. 2.	Size of the company, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime) 3.	History of company launches in the last 5 years and customers Host contractors are also asked to provide 4.	Comments and questions on the attached Statement of Work The due date for responses is January 31, 2013. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.  Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  All responses shall be submitted to Dona.D.Vanterpool@nasa.gov no later than January 31,2013.  Please reference RFI4200452490 in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<CONTACT>Susan Messina, Contracting Officer, Phone 571-227-4055, Email susan.messina@dhs.gov
<DESC>1.0 OVERVIEW/INTRODUCTION
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit security equipment testing entities' capabilities to perform developmental test and evaluation of Transportation Security Equipment (TSE) and to provide this information to equipment manufacturers interested in doing business with TSA. In an effort to expedite the testing, acquisition, and deployment of qualified systems, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is promoting the establishment of preliminary system development gateways by identifying capable third party testing facilities. The purpose of creating this initial step is to assist Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in developing more mature systems prior to entering the formal TSA T&amp;E process. This "third party testing" concept will allow OEMs to assess their systems against TSA requirements, enhance and mature their technology readiness, and subsequently reduce the time required to proceed through each phase of testing because systems that successfully transition will be more capable of meeting TSA operational effectiveness and suitability requirements.</p>
<p>Third party testing will also advance TSAs and OSCs efforts to deliver effective and innovative security technologies. TSA has consistently embraced three core goals related to its acquisition of new security screening systems and technologies: <br /><br />&bull; Deliver security systems demonstrating improved operational performance and security effectiveness<br />&bull; Accommodate successful integration of new technologies with ongoing security operations and existing technologies and infrastructure<br />&bull; Facilitate competition among multiple qualified manufacturers<br />TSA believes that by its support and identification of third party testing capabilities and by providing the OEMs and potential testers with the applicable TSA requirements and testing documentation specific to the systems under development, the OEMs will submit more mature systems to TSA for qualification testing; thus, allowing TSA to meet its acquisition goals.</p>
<p>2.0 INDUSTRY RESPONSE</p>
<p>2.1 COVER LETTER (1 PAGE)</p>
<p>The cover letter must clearly identify the following information:</p>
<p>1. Company's Name <br />2. Company's Address <br />3. DUNS Number <br />4. Point of Contact(s) (Name, title, email, and phone number) <br />5. Identify your business size - small, small disadvantaged, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged, HUBZone small, woman-owned small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small - based upon NAICS Code 541611 "Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services" with a size standard of $14 million.</p>
<p>2.2 TESTING CAPABILITIES STATEMENT (5 PAGES)</p>
<p>In order for the TSA to improve its understanding of market capabilities and identify potential vendors/performers that are capable of providing third party testing support to the OEMs, the testing entity's response must, through a narrative description, identify their firm's capabilities to conduct tests of TSE at their facilities. Examples of relevant testing includes (but is not limited to), explosives detection, integration testing with passenger checkpoint or baggage handling systems, interoperability testing, human factors assessments, and environmental testing. Commercial or federal examples are permitted. When identifying current or past experience, please identify the following:</p>
<p>1. Name of Customer <br />2. Point of Contact (name, title, phone, and email) <br />3. Period of Performance <br />4. Scope of the Effort<br />5. Brief Description of the Work completed within the Scope of the Contract/Task Order</p>
<p>The capabilities statement shall not exceed five (5) pages in length.</p>
<p>2.3 WHITE PAPER (5 PAGES)</p>
<p>The third party testing process is not defined nor funded by the Government, and a contractual relationship with TSA and the third party testing entity will not be formed. It will be a relationship between the testing entity and the OEM. Responses to this RFI should include a white paper that describes how the process would work from the perspective of the test facility in a relationship with the OEM. Specific topics that should be covered include:</p>
<p>1. A process for allocating test requirements to third party testing organizations<br />2. Government furnished information (GFI) that would be required to complete testing<br />3. Anticipated timelines for various types of testing<br />4. Funding mechanisms that would incentivize successful test outcomes (NOTE: the Government will not fund third party testing initiatives)<br />5. Risks of using third parties to conduct testing and potential mitigation strategies<br />The White Paper shall not exceed five (5) pages in length.</p>
<p>3.0 SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>The information requested in support of the Capabilities Statement and White Paper must be submitted in writing. The submitted Capabilities Statement shall not exceed five (5) pages, and the White Paper shall not exceed five (5) pages, in addition to a one (1) page cover letter, for a total submission not to exceed 11 pages.</p>
<p>Your submission should be organized in accordance with the instructions in this document in order to permit a thorough and accurate review and evaluation by the TSA. All questions regarding this RFI must be submitted via electronic mail to susan.messina@dhs.gov by 12/21/12.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement to conduct projects on invasive pythons, with a focus on southwestern Florida.  The purpose of this project is to conduct research on invasive Burmese pythons in Florida to gain a better understanding of python distribution, detection methods, and movement behavior.    This field work involves conducting surveys along a levee at Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in which removal efforts can be reliably assessed because python numbers at this site appear to be peaking and public access is restricted.  Additionally, field work will be conducted along a western portion of Tamiami Trail in an area where hatchlings have recently started showing up.  The assessment of the effects of python removal along levees will utilize radiotelemetry, and the project will be pursued using VHF tags and ground telemetry at Rookery Bay NERR.  Four to six pythons will be radio tagged and tracked weekly from winter 2013 through summer 2013. The USGS intends to award a sole source purchase order to Mr. Paul Andreadis. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), this purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents with/without accompanying information will be acknowledged; however a solicitation will not be provided.

<DESC> <br> This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  <br> This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  <br>  <br>  <br> 1.	 Purpose.  The purpose of this project is to provide a spillway dewatering structure for Harlan County Lake's Dam. The structure is necessary to enable maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing Tainter Gates. <br>  <br> 2.	Dam Location and Description. Harlan County Dam is located on the Republican River in south-central Nebraska near Alma, NE. The dam was built in the early 1950's as part of a flood control/irrigation project.  The dam is combined earth-rolled embankment and concrete gravity dam. The concrete section includes a controlled spillway regulated by 18 Tainter Gates, 9 sluice gates and two irrigation outlets. The Tainter gates are 40 feet wide and 30 feet high and located between piers located 48 feet on center. The existing piers are constructed of an 8 feet wide section above the spillway weir. The piers resist forces imposed by the water and Tainter gates under various water levels and gate configurations. The piers also carry loads from the bridge that spans between the piers. The reinforcing in the piers is typically spaced at 12 inches on center vertically and horizontally, with 4   quote mark  concrete cover.  The spillway bridge above the Tainter Gates is simple span with 18 spans.  The cast-in-place deck and sidewalks are supported by steel girders, floorbeams and stringers.  The steel members are non-composite with the deck. <br>  <br> 3.	 Project Description.  The work in this contract involves fabricating 16 new stoplogs, 4 new pier guides, 2 support (sill) beams, 1 lifting beam, and 1 rigid template.  The pier guides and support beam will be installed on the upstream face of the dam by Hilti HIT-RE 500-SD Adhesive Anchoring System and stainless steel (ASTM F593 CW2 (316)) all-thread anchors.  The stoplogs will be constructed of ASTM A709 plate steel and fabricated into H-sections, approximately 47'-7 quote mark  long. The web thickness is   inches.  To accommodate tolerances and limit weight, upper and lower-bound thicknesses of the flanges are specified 0.80 quote mark  and 0.75 quote mark , respectively.  Each stoplog will be placed between vertical pier guides attached to the upstream side of the weir.  <br>  <br> The vertical pier guides are also constructed of ASTM A709 steel plates and fabricated as built-up H-sections, approximately 17 feet long.  The pier guides will be anchored to the upstream face of the weir.  A grout pad is placed between the guide and the pier to address surface defects, tolerances of stoplog system erection, superior seal against water, and for immediate force transmission from stoplog bearing pressures into the dam's pier.   <br>  <br> The stoplogs will rest on a support beam.  The support beam will be fabricated from a bent ASTM A 709 steel plate (approximately 48 feet long), bent in the shape of an inverted L, and have intermittent stiffener plates welded to the support beam.  The top horizontal surface of the support beam is the sill for the stoplog system.  The support beam is also anchored to the concrete dam.  To address the conditions of the upstream surface of the dam as well as construction tolerances, a grout pad is placed between the dam and both the pier guides and support beam. <br> Fabricating the stoplog system's steel structures will require (but is not limited to): weldment fabrication by a certified welder meeting AWS D1.5 or AWS D1.1 (as applicable) standards, weldment inspection by a certified weld inspector, and vinyl painting (3-A-Z paint system).  Precision machining will be required to meet the required tolerances.   Many tolerances for stoplogs, pier guides, and support beam allow less variation than ASTM A6 for similar rolled sections.   <br> 4.	 Installation.  Two options for installing the steel structures have been evaluated and appear feasible. One option is to lower the structures into place with a crane from the bridge. It is anticipated that, in addition, a barge will be required upstream of the spillway for installation of pier guides and support beam, and their respective anchors. The second option for placing the steel structures is from barges on the lake upstream of the spillway.  <br>  <br> 5.	Bridge.  If a crane from the spillway bridge will be used to deploy the stoplogs and other components of the stoplog system, the bridge could be subjected to larger loads than it was designed to support. In accordance with the 2011 AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation (MBE), Second Edition, the bridge was analyzed considering crane loads for a permit load condition.  Local crane rental companies and crane manufacturers crane configurations and support reactions were collected. The bridge deck and structural steel members were analyzed to determine the maximum permit loads that could be allowed.  The result is that the bridge is capable of carrying the expected crane loads without exceeding its capacity.  The bridge was investigated for a 65 Ton crane configuration.  As part of the work plan that shall be approved prior to starting work, the contractor shall provide the pattern and magnitude of loads imposed by the specific crane they plan to use for all expected lifting conditions required for the work and permit load rating calculations in accordance with AASHTO MBE to ensure they do not exceed the capacity of the bridge. The minimum recommended permit live load factor is 1.4, the minimum impact factor is 1.0, and the capacity of the bridge shall account for the bottom flange width reduction of 1-inch as noted in the calculations.  The loading configurations and calculations are required to be submitted for USACE approval to ensure overloading the bridge does not occur. <br>  <br> 6.	Major Activities. <br>  <br> a)	Field-verify condition and measure upstream surface of the Dam to ensure grout pad can be placed and all tolerances prescribed in the plans and specifications can be met. <br>  <br> b)	Construct underwater test anchors in pre-cast concrete blocks.   Perform pull-out tests of the anchors.  <br>  <br> c)	Locate the vertical sealing plane for stoplog erection. Perform Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to locate and subsequently mark Pier rebar at anchors. A plan for approval shall be submitted explaining method for placing template and locating anchors within tolerances. For rebar located under the water surface elevation, it is acceptable to project vertical rebar vertically and to assume horizontal rebar is spaced per Record Drawings. The maximum acceptable GPR elevation is 1956.0 ft for locating vertical rebar. <br>  <br> d)	Perform any existing concrete preparation or repairs if required. <br>  <br> e)	Verify proposed anchor lengths are sufficient. <br>  <br> f)	Upon approval of the plan (step b), fabricate a rigid template that meets the requirements specified in the plans and specifications. Fabricate pier guides, support beam, stoplogs, and lifting beam in accordance with plans and specifications. <br>  <br> g)	After shop verification that template conforms to tolerances, install template on dam. Apply debonding agent or plastic cover to template prior to grout placement. Template must be securely placed and surveyed to verify location will produce the desired location of the sealing plane within tolerances. <br>  <br> h)	Locate and install pier guide and support beam anchors. <br>  <br> i)	With template and formwork securely placed, place grout. <br>  <br> j)	Remove formwork. Inspect and repair any damage to grout. <br>  <br> k)	Flush mount pier guides and support beam to grout pad at spillway bay to be dewatered. Prior to deploying guides, grease inside flanges for smother deployment of stoplogs. <br>  <br> l)	Install stoplogs between pier guide flanges such that stoplogs do not get hung up and damage does not occur to seals.  Deploy no more than eight stoplogs per spillway bay. <br>  <br> 7.	 Divers.  It is assumed that pool levels during construction will be normal and diving will be required to install the pier guide anchors as well as the support beam anchors. It is also assumed that diving will be required to fasten the pier guides and support beam to the anchors. It is at the contractor's discretion to develop ways to dewater these areas in lieu of diving. <br>  <br> *************************************************************************** <br> 8.	Information Sought.  Of particular interest in the sources sought is to receive industry suggestions to improve the value or lessen the difficulty of select activities.  These activities include: <br>  <br> a)	Stabilizing pre-cast concrete blocks for drilling and installation of test anchors. <br> b)	Size limitation of test anchor specimens for transport and testing of anchors. <br> c)	Splice locations in the stoplogs, and other suggestions that assist with the machining or transportation of the stoplogs. <br>  <br>  <br> THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND/OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).

<a href="mailto:courtney.e.luckett@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Louisville</a>
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project: Design and construct a three-story, 296 Person Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) barracks that is consistent with the architectural theme of the adjacent Battalion Headquarters Complex facilities. Provide fire protection, suppression and alarm systems and AT/FP) measures. Connect energy monitoring and control systems (EMCS). Supporting facilities include utilities, lighting, parking, walks and storm drainage. Provisions for persons with disabilities will be provided.  Located at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>  <br>  (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to Courtney.e.luckett@usace.army.mil no later than 10:00AM EST on 27 December 2012.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this Labor Market Survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to solicitation accouncements separately from responses to this survey. <br>

<DESC>Sources Sought for IGI&amp;S Procurement
<p>This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. A contract may not be awarded as a result of this sources sought. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC), has a requirement to provide Installation Geospatial Information &amp; Services (IGI&amp;S) support for the Army and other DoD activities within the Installations, Energy and Environment (IE&amp;E) domain. The program's goals are to establish policy, create guidance, operate and maintain an enterprise installation management geospatial capability and use that capability to support the daily geospatial business needs of all installations and programs. The program is responsible for providing oversight on the creation, maintenance, and management of installation geospatial data. It also supports other Army and DoD entities requiring this information. For users inside and outside of the Army, from installation office-level programs up to OSD-level initiatives, the IGI&amp;S program goal is to bring the existing disparate IE&amp;E geospatial programs into a single over-arching program of which every installation geospatial user is a part. This is a "geospatial" program that is not specific to a single technology but covers geographic information systems (GIS), Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD), imagery, and other supporting technologies. Specific goals and objectives are as follows:</p>

<DESC>Request for Information M00264-13-RFI-0205<br />Marine Corps COOL Support Services<br />13 Dec 2012
<p>PURPOSE: This Request for Information (RFI) is an effort to conduct market research for use in formulating an acquisition plan/strategy to obtain support services to provide assistance to Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&amp;RA) to align civilian credentialing to Marine Corps occupational specialties. This RFI allows potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: This requirement is being driven by two initiatives: 1) Guidance from the Department of Defense (DoD) to all Services to combine joint functionality/ modeling of similar or duplicative training and programs; and 2) the Marine Corps' own effort to incorporate civilian credentialing opportunities for Active and Reserve Marines in their personal and professional development roadmaps. These initiatives have led to a requirement to develop an internet based website designed to provide Marines with information on how to fulfill the requirements of civilian certifications related to their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). Modeled after the Navy's COOL website, MC COOL will provide learning pathways to civilian certification, apprenticeship and licensure.</p>
<p>CORE OBJECTIVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED: The draft Performance Work Statement provided with this RFI sets forth the work efforts required to support the Marine Cool requirement. The scope of this effort shall encompass the following objectives/tasks:<br />&bull; Research and analysis of civilian credentials relating to Marine occupations<br />&bull; Develop internet based resource that catalogs and defines comprehensive information on occupational credentials<br />&bull; Develop a web-based credentialing portal to educate on credentialing opportunities and roadmap<br />&bull; Provide website maintenance and Program Support. <br />&bull; Provide user support for supported systems through the contract period. <br />&bull; Provide server hosting for supported systems.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter, discussion and contact information. Subject response must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives; (2) Two customer references describing similar work efforts; (3) Commercial published labor categories and rates used by respondents for similar services (if available-this does not count against the 10 page limit); and (4) Other material relevant to establishing the core competencies of the firm. Please identify Large/Small Business size, CAGE Code and GSA Schedule contract number if available.</p>
<p>Response is due by 7 January 2013, 3:00 PM. Please submit e-mail responses to Lawrence Rice, Customer Liaison, at: Lawrence.rice@usmc.mil</p>
<p>NOTES: Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation. The Marine Corps is neither seeking proposals nor accepting unsolicited proposals, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.

<DESC>Request for Information M00264-13-RFI-0206<br />Ethical Decision Games<br />13 Dec 2012
<p>PURPOSE: This Request for Information (RFI) is an effort to conduct market research for use in formulating an acquisition plan/strategy to obtain support for the Deputy Commandant, Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs (DC,M&amp;RA) Sexual Assault Prevention &amp; Response Program (SAPR) to further expand the knowledge of Marine Corps leadership and other military personnel about sexual assault, including what their responsibilities are when a sexual assault is reported and how they can intervene to prevent sexual assaults. The objective for this project is to develop high-impact videos that engage leadership and other military personnel by having them think critically about scenarios presented to them and how best to respond in accordance to Marine Corps requirements. This RFI allows potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: In April 2012, the Commandant of the Marine Corps convened an Operational Planning Team (OPT), which developed a three-phased campaign plan to reinvigorate the SAPR program, improve reporting rates, and reduce, with a goal to eliminate, incidents of sexual assault. A key component to reaching these campaign goals is by providing training to Marines of all ranks. As part of Phase II (FY13), SAPR is tasked with developing and implementing video based SAPR Ethical Decision Games (EDG) for Marine Corps leadership, which is to be infused with lessons learned from Phase I training execution, including previous EDGs developed.</p>
<p>CORE OBJECTIVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED: The draft Performance Work Statement provided with this RFI sets forth the work efforts required to support the SAPR EDG requirement. The scope of this effort shall encompass the following objectives/tasks:</p>
<p>&bull; Script Development<br />&bull; Pre-Production: Storyboard and Logistics Planning <br />&bull; Production: Filming<br />&bull; Post-Production: Editing, Finalizing, and Delivering Final Product<br />&bull; Project Management Support</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter, discussion and contact information. Subject response must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives; (2) Two customer references describing similar work efforts; (3) Commercial published labor categories and rates used by respondents for similar services ( if available- this does not count against the 10 page limit); and (4) Other material relevant to establishing the core competencies of the firm. Please identify Large/Small Business size, CAGE Code and GSA Schedule contract number if available.</p>
<p>Response is due by 7 January 2013, 3:00 PM. Please submit e-mail responses to Lawrence Rice, Customer Liaison, at: Lawrence.rice@usmc.mil</p>

<DESC><br />
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) division located in Raleigh, NC intends to award on a sole source basis a 5-year IDIQ Contract or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to Carnegie Institute, in Pittsburg, PA under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and U.S.C. 253( c )(1 ). The agreement is for the rapid sorting, authoritative identification, and specimen-based documentation of exotic wood-feeding beetles and other wood-boring insects to facilitate early detection, eradication, and pest management for ongoing field season in Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and possibly other U.S. states. Carnegie Institute is a nonprofit organization which has performed these services successfully for APHIS since 2007.</p>
<p>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS: The Carnegie Museum of Natural History is the only credible source for performing this work at the volume specified in a timely manner. CMNH has the staff that is immediately available, trained and capable of full-time activity for handling, storing, sorting, preparing, transferring, curating, identifying, data basing archiving, and as necessary, providing imaging and DNA analysis necessary to resolve or affirm. There are five key personnel available to the Section of Invertebrate Zoology that make this work feasible and credible, a professional systematist/administrator, a molecular/bioinformatics person, and three beetle specialists capable of worldwide identification for a wide range of beetle taxa. CMNH personnel have previously performed the work for other federal agencies since 2004 in a number of states in the Eastern United States and Puerto Rico, particularly Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Ohio. CMNH delivers identification based on professionally prepared, labeled, and curated specimens from trap samples, thereby rendering those identifications verifiable in the future. Non-prepared, non-target specimens in samples may also be prepared on CMNH budgets, and in any case are preserved in a large sample archive allowing future retrospective study of taxa they may contain that may become problematic in the future. Sample archiving and specimen-based documentation are a trademark of responsible science and a major value-added component of CMNH involvement in this project. Furthermore, CMNH has the requisite resources and equipment on hand to do the job, and is currently engaged in similar and/or complimentary activities for the U.S. Forest Service. Of special note is the exemplary CMNH reference collection of wood-boring beetles, encompassing the majority of both native and exotic species. CMNH also has a world-class library of literature on the identification of beetles, both domestic and foreign. No other service provider with equivalent expertise has been discovered to date that can offer the required identification services.</p>
<p>A firm-fixed price IDIQ contract or BPA will be awarded to cover services from 01/01/2013 through 12/31/2013. The total value is not-to-exceed $600,000.00 during the total period of performance. This notice is for informational purposes only. No formal solicitation will be issued. Any questions or inquiries must be mailed, e-mailed or faxed to the Contracting Officer, to the attention of the point of contact listed in this notice. Point of contact: Michael Chiodi, Contracting Specialist, (612) 336-3203, FAX: (612) 336-3550, E-mail: michael.j.chiodi@aphis.usda.gov.</p>

<DESC>The previous announcement has been updated to incorporate the following changes: Revise size standards, remove references to reserves, and provide details for the Industry Day.   <br>  <br> EXPRESS is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based upon the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules for acquiring advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel). These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and technical and management support. The complete scopes of work for each domain may be reviewed on the website listed below. The EXPRESS program consists of four (4) domains in which services may be ordered: Technical, Programmatic, Logistics, and Business and Analytical (B&A). Competitively awarded BPAs have been established in each of the domains as follows: Business & Analytical - 4 each, Logistics - 6 each, Programmatic - 6 each, and Technical - 11 each. The BPAs were established with a provision for an annual open season in which the Government may add additional BPA teams or allow existing Prime Contractors/Team Leaders the opportunity to restructure existing teams. The purpose of the current open season is to add additional BPA teams. Domain Statements of Work as well as other EXPRESS information may be found on the EXPRESS website located at:  <br>  <br> http://www.acc.army.mil/contractingcenters/acc-rsa/Express.asp <br>  <br> The Government intends to award additional BPAs in the following domains as noted: B&A - two small business (SB); Logistics - one full and open (F&O) and two SB; Programmatic - one F&O, 2 SB and one 8A; and Technical - one F&O, one SB and one 8A. These are estimated numbers only. The Government reserves the right to vary the number of awards depending on the number of responsive quotations submitted. The F&O awards will be determined first, followed by the SB awards, and finally the 8(a) awards. Eligibility to compete for the anticipated BPA awards is limited to those businesses which hold one of the required GSA schedules and, for the SB/8A awards, which meet the size standards for the NAICS Code applicable to that schedule identified as primary for the EXPRESS program. Respondents may seek consideration as a prime/team leader in more than one domain. <br>  <br> Each prime/team leader is required to hold at least one of the following GSA schedules at the time it responds to the Request for Quotation (RFQ): 871-Professional Engineering Services (PES), 874V-Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD), 874-Management Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS), 70-Information Technology (IT), or a 00CORP-Consolidated Products and Services Schedule (formerly Corporate Schedule) including appropriate PES, LOGWORLD, MOBIS, or IT Special Item Numbers. Respondents may submit multiple schedules per domain in response to the RFQ. However, a primary schedule that will be used by the prime/team leader to satisfy the majority of the domain requirements must be identified. Companies interested in obtaining a GSA schedule, or expediting a schedule application that has been submitted may contact the local representative, Eddie Mills via email at eddie.mills@gsa.gov. <br>  <br> If MOBIS or LOGWORLD is identified as the primary schedule, the NAICS Code and business size standard assigned to the respondents' schedule by GSA will apply. If PES is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS Code 541330 and a size standard of $35.5M, will apply to the Business & Analytical, Logistics and Programmatic Domains and NAICS Code 541712 and a size standard of 1,000 employees will apply to the Technical Domain. If IT is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS Code 541511/541512/541513 and a size standard of $25.5M will apply to all domains. If the Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is identified as the primary schedule, the primary special item number covered by this schedule (PES, MOBIS, LOGWORLD, or IT) that will be used to satisfy the majority of domain requirements must also be identified. The NAICS Code and size standard for the primary special item number, as identified above, will then apply. The applicable NAICS Code must be available on the schedule identified as primary. The small business certification which was made at the primary schedule contract level, for that applicable NAICS Code, will be utilized to determine business size for EXPRESS. <br>  <br> Respondents are cautioned that failure to comply with the following criteria will result in the rejection of their submission, and they will not be considered for award: (1) Must hold one of the required GSA schedules, as of the date of submission of quote, (2) Submission of all required documentation as stated in the RFQ. <br>  <br> The RFQs will be posted on the EXPRESS website sometime in January. Responses to the RFQs will be due approximately 30 days after the RFQ issue date to the following address: U.S. Army Contracting Command, ATTN: CCAM-EX-P/Elbert Clarke, Sparkman Center, Building 5303, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. Respondents are advised that responses sent by conventional US Mail service or courier services (Federal Express and UPS) are not routed directly to the above address. Late submissions will not be considered. <br>  <br> An Industry Day will be held on 9 January 2013, at the Jackson Center, 6001 Moquin Drive, Huntsville, AL  35806.  The current open season will be discussed, in addition to EXPRESS-The Next Generation (X-TNG).  Individual breakout sessions will cover the anticipated topics of NAICS, Business Size for EXPRESS, GSA Schedules and Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs).  Seating is limited and online registration is required.  Registration for each individual session is available from 17 December 2012 through 7 January 2013, at the following link: <br>  <br> http://www.jacksoncenter.net <br>    <br> Questions regarding this RFQ shall be submitted electronically to RFQ Questions and Answers on the EXPRESS website. <br>  <br>

To support its research community and collection development activities in the digital arena, the Library requires participation in a digital repository that aggregates the Library of Congress' digital collections with the digital content of the nation's other largest research libraries. The digital repository must use high quality metadata created and implemented according to accepted library preservation standards (for example, PREMIS), providing researchers the powerful, multifaceted discovery and analysis capabilities they need when accessing digital content. The Library also requires that the digital repository provide long-term storage and maintenance of the Library's digital materials as well as the digital collections of the nation's largest research libraries in perpetuity at the lowest possible cost and with the public good as the primary intent.
<p>A digital repository storing Library materials must have the capacity to maintain its collections over the long-term, conforming to established digital preservation and audit standards, guidelines, and best practices such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, the Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), the Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment (DRAMBORA) framework, and the Trustworthy Repositories Audit &amp; Certification (TRAC). HathiTrust is the only established service that conforms to these standards and provides the aforementioned access, discovery, and analysis capabilities.</p>
<p>The Library seeks to join a cooperative public interest venture to support the American research library community in its effort to establish and develop a sustainable digital book preservation repository. As a member of the HathiTrust consortium, the Library will be positioned to encourage the growth and development of Hathi and successor entities as repositories of the nation's digital heritage. Through the participation with the HathiTrust consortium, the Library will contribute to the development of the project and can be represented in key governance bodies. The Library's involvement will support the mission of the Library and that of HathiTrust, which serves the Library as well as many of the nation's major educational institutions.</p>
<p>Response to this notice must include technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates ability to meet the Library of Congress requirements. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the Contracting Officer as specified.</p>
<p>This synopsis is NOT to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded based on offers received in response to this notice. Responses will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government.</p>

<DESC>USDA Forest Service Request for Information (RFI) for the<br />Forest Health Technology Enterprise Team (FHTET)
<p>13 December 2012</p>
<p>This RFI is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a request for quotations. This notice does not constitute a Request for Bid, Request for Quote or Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE <br />The US Forest Services, Washington Office (WO) Acquisition Management (AQM), Information Technology (IT) Support Branch is conducting a market analysis with this RFI to refine the requirement and determine the most suitable approach for acquiring and fulfilling the needs for core IT support services that address both field and WO support for low to moderate risk technology tasks in support of the Forest Health Technology Enterprise Team program.</p>
<p>The information collected in this RFI will be used to define the government's requirements and create the appropriate acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>Responding to this RFI does not automatically include the responder on any bidders list, if such a list is developed. Depending on the quantity and quality of the responses received, the criteria may serve to generate the initial pool of potential contractors to be invited to respond to a resulting solicitation.</p>
<p>WO AQM-IT Support Branch is interested in collecting information on industry capabilities in the following task areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Project Management-core services</p>
<p>&bull; Communication Support-core services</p>
<p>&bull; Computer System Management-core services</p>
<p>&bull; Geospatial Data and Software Development and Maintenance-core services</p>
<p>&bull; Forest Health Technology Knowledge Transfer-core services</p>
<p>&bull; Natural Resource Data Analysis, Modeling and Reporting-core services</p>
<p>&bull; Rapid web-based geospatial application development-non core services</p>
<p>&bull; Innovative technological solutions-non core services</p>
<p>&bull; Development of Enterprise GIS systems and new geospatial data models-non core services</p>
<p>&bull; Agile software development-non core services</p>

<p>&bull; Innovative statistical analyses for forest pest modeling-non core services</p>
<p>&bull; Mobile computing based data capture technology-non core services</p>
<p>&#61553; A primary example of non-core service output is the current FHTET portal (http://foresthealth.fs.usda.gov) and its modules:<br />o Alien Forest Pest Explorer<br />o Forest Pest Conditions<br />o Exotic Forest Pests (ExFor)<br />o Forest Disturbance Mapper<br />o California Insect and Disease Database (Forest Pest Observations)<br />o Forest Pest Data Summaries</p>
<p>&#61553; Typical examples of potential future non-core service projects:<br />o Development of a new tablet based forest insect and disease survey hardware and software system that meets the needs of aerial and ground based surveys.<br />o Development of a new standard data model for national level grid based evaluation and analysis.<br />o Development of pre-visual insect and disease mortality detection methods.</p>
<p><br />2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND <br />The Forest Health Technology Enterprise Team (FHTET) has a requirement for technology development and support services. The technology involved covers multiple disciplines in an integrated fashion including forest entomology and pathology, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, database and software development, forest biometry, climate change and carbon cycling, geospatial modeling techniques, computer systems development, and project management.<br />FHTET is a detached Washington Office Unit located in Fort Collins, Colorado that offers natural resources and forest health technology development and technology knowledge transfer services to Forest Health Protection (FHP) Units and cooperators nationwide. In order to support a wide array of technology development and transfer efforts, various integrated natural resource and computer systems technologies must be developed and maintained including but not limited to; computer systems, data collection devices, display devices, geospatial models, specialized commercial off the shelf (COTS) and custom web and desktop software applications and analysis. The users of these technologies are a small highly specialized group. This group includes entomologists and pathologists from state forestry organizations, Federal partners, and natural resource specialists from a wide array of universities and non-Governmental organizations. The technologies developed and maintained require a close integration with associated forest health disciplines. This reliance is exemplified by FHTET's close working relationship with strategic issues in the Washington Office, and tactical issues with the field organizations. The specific technologies developed or transferred include hardware, software, databases, websites, methods, analyses, risk and hazard assessments, and information which are based upon USFS strategic direction and are consistent with USFS objectives for ecosystem management, forest health initiatives, and services to state and private forestry cooperators.</p>
<p>Projects undertaken are frequently at different phases of the technology development life cycle. Most projects are accomplished through groups of specialists and cooperators representing diverse subject areas. A high level of interactivity and coordination is required among projects, which often cross a wide range of disciplines. Project staff may be composed exclusively of Federal employees or a mixture of Federal, state, other cooperators, and contractor employees. Ability to objectively communicate information and exchange ideas is important for both Federal project managers and contractors assigned to specific tasks.</p>
<p>This RFI is being used to receive feedback/comments on the attached PWS and to develop an acquisition strategy that will ensure that the Forest Service is able to make informed set-aside recommendations as well as receive best value offers once a solicitation for this requirement is developed.</p>
<p>3. OVERVIEW OF CAPABILITIES <br />The Forest Service requires achievement of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Technology development and knowledge transfer efforts that support Forest Service professional and technical staff in carrying out mission-orientated activities.</p>
<p>&bull; Consistent, stable support for FHTET enhances mission-oriented activities and outcomes.</p>
<p>&bull; Innovative solutions are developed for ad hoc requests of FHTET.</p>
<p>4. QUESTIONS <br />Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer; rhinton@fs.fed.us. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted.

The system will instantiate modules for discovering, translating and visualizing data : <strong>Data Discovery</strong> - Query in any language and automatically pull data of any type (YouTube, Twitter, Forums, etc), <strong>Translation layer</strong> - A model based interface that will allow maximum reuse of the constituent interfaces to be able to adapt to new and emerging data sources <strong>User Interface (UI)</strong> - Provide an interface capability that will allow users to define their interface to meet their needs with minimal to no training. The system will organize and structure data so that it can be ingested into third party tools. The specific performance metrics will be derived from the IV rapid prototype developed by DISA.<br /><br />The period of performance is a one base year plus two one-year option.<br />This action will result in a cost plus fixed fee contract. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511 with a size standard of $25.5M. <br /><br /><strong>No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting DISA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. All questions and/or responses must be directed via email&nbsp;to KimOanh.P.Scott.civ@mail.mil telephone inquiries will not be accepted.<br /></strong><br />A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition will be posted within 14 days of award. <br />

Length of service <br> includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or <br> successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the <br> performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) <br>  <br> HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther <br> King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor <br> Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A <br> contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in <br> accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: <br>  <br> 1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does <br> not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, <br> administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because <br> most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate <br> not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per <br> week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. <br> 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations <br> within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not <br> list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey <br> data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds <br> $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For <br> example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties <br> within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer <br> occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, <br> then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the <br> conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage <br> determination. <br>  <br> Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer <br> industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer <br> professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees <br> who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: <br>     (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including <br> consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional <br> specifications; <br>     (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or <br> modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and <br> related to user or system design specifications; <br>     (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer <br> programs related to machine operating systems; or <br>     (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which <br> requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400). <br>  <br> 2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you <br> work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential <br> and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. <br>  If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your <br> regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday <br> premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime <br> (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered <br> overtime work). <br>  <br>  <br> HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees <br> employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or <br> in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This <br> includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive <br> ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder <br> and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. <br>   Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations <br> on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations <br> involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. <br>  <br> A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that <br> represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to <br> ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials <br> which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the <br> employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the <br> like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. <br> All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and <br> incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials <br> are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for <br> ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. <br>  <br> ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** <br>  <br> If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract <br> (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or <br> local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by <br> laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an <br> employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage <br> determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the <br> following standards as compliance: <br>  <br> The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an <br> adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual <br> cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made <br> the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to <br> this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining <br> agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary <br> affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning <br> and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in <br> those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of  quote mark wash and wear quote mark  <br> materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do <br> not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial <br> laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms <br> of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, <br> there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. <br>  <br> The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the <br>  quote mark Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations quote mark , Fifth Edition, April 2006, <br> unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A <br> links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. <br> gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at <br> http://wdol.gov/. <br>  <br> REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form <br> 1444 (SF 1444)} <br>  <br> Conformance Process: <br>  <br> The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is <br> not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to <br> be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage <br> determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable <br> relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted <br> classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such <br> conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the <br> fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by <br> the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) <br> of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall <br> be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} <br> When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 <br> should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be <br> conformed. <br>  <br> The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: <br>  <br> 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed <br> occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). <br>  <br> 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order <br> proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each <br> proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage <br> rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the <br> authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized <br> representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the <br> contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees <br> performs any contract work. <br>  <br> 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report <br> of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent <br> information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage <br> and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, <br> for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). <br>  <br> 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or <br> disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or <br> notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process <br> the request. <br>  <br> 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. <br>  <br> 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. <br>  <br> Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. <br>  <br> When preparing a conformance request, the  quote mark Service Contract Act Directory of <br> Occupations quote mark  (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure <br> that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the <br> wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that <br> determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. <br> Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide <br> classifications listed in the wage determination. <br>  <br>

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

<DESC>As part of the due diligence, The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) conducts cost-benefit analysis to assess proposed projects' likely economic impact and cost-effectiveness and estimate the share of the population who may benefit from the program. Thus, MCC is seeking a results reporting analyst to support the results reporting function of the division by carrying out basic data analysis, database management, data entry, report layout and production, and web site support.
<p>This position is located in the Department of Policy and Evaluation (DPE). The incumbent serves as Results Reporting Analyst within the Monitoring and Evaluation Division (M&amp;E) of DPE. The analyst will report to the Managing Director of M&amp;E. After a Compact is entered into with an eligible country, focusing on results during implementation, the division is responsible for, among other things, monitoring the economic impact of Compact interventions on household income and poverty reduction within the country.</p>
<p>The contract will be for a Personal Services Contractor (PSC). A personal services contract is different from the usual non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by FAR 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSC is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (FAR 7.502). By law and by the terms of their personal services contract, the PSC is subject to most of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances, and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />WRD-13-00607</p>
<p>1.0 Organization</p>
<p>1.1 Organization: The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC), is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship for living marine resources.</p>
<p>1.2 Background and Objective: The Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Northwest region's marine and anadromous resources.</p>
<p>2.0 Services and/or Products Required</p>
<p>Required material - Litz Wire 10AWG 1100/40 (5x5x44/40)<br />Quantity - 15,000 feet in 1,000 foot spools<br />Rationale - <br />Litz wire is an important innovation which has been in use for years in many electromechanical operations and is still being improved upon. It is essentially many thin wires coated with an insulating film and woven together in a specific pattern, of which there are several from which to choose depending on the purpose. Litz wire is a specialty wire product designed to overcome the ohmic losses that result from alternating currents flowing in wire. <br />Litz wire's advantage is in its much reduced skin effect and proximity effect loss. The electrical advantage of Litz wire comes from its construction geometry. Litz wire is made up of several individually insulated magnetic wires woven into one of several patterns. The wires are woven such that there is no gap space in the cross-section of the whole wire. This reduces the "skin effect," a phenomenon which tends to cause current to flow in a layer close to the surface of a conductor. The presence of many fine wires woven together in the form factor of a standard wire greatly increases the surface area present but does not increase the size of the whole conductor. Litz wire also has a reduced "proximity effect," the tendency of current to flow in loops due to magnetic fields from other conductors in proximity to the wire. Well-constructed litz wire will have a near-equal amount of current flow through each strand. <br />For our application, we must construct coil antennas to detect Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags. PIT tags are radio frequency identification devices that transmit a unique identifier when excited by an appropriate electromagnetic field. The coil antennas we construct to excite and read the PIT tags are installed in streams and rivers across the Pacific Northwest. Because we are working in natural, unregulated, river systems, the power and control electronics for the PIT tag detection system must be located at a distance sufficient to protect them from inundation and damage due to high flows. To construct antennas that are located far from transmitters / receivers and that read in a consistent manner over wide variation in environmental conditions (temperature and water depth) requires the antennas to be capable of acting at high current levels with minimal self-generated noise. As the electrical current demands of the antenna design increase (large antenna, long distance from transceiver), the potential for the system to exhibit ohmic, or non-linear behavior increase. In direct current situations, ohmic behavior results from resistance in the conductor generating heat and thus changing the conductor resistance. To overcome this form of ohmic behavior, larger conductors are called for. Ohmic behavior also results in alternating current situations. In this case, conductor resistance changes as a function of frequency. For PIT tag detection antennas, we must generate a field that oscillates at 134kHz. At this frequency, plain copper wire in the antenna coil is subject to skin and proximity effects that reduce the size and quality of the antenna field. To overcome this form of ohmic behavior requires the use of Litz wire - or many small conductors, each insulated from each other, but the total cross sectional area of which is equal to the wire size appropriate for the current load at 0hHz. Litz wire provides a ready means for reducing these Ohmic losses, and consequently increasing antenna gain. <br />For our current levels (~6A) and frequency (134kHz), we must use 10AWG wire (set by DC current level) that is make up of 1,100 40AWG insulated conductors in a 5x5x44 bundle configuration.<br />Constructing Litz wire is still an innovative process; there are a few accepted standard methods of construction but new research is still carried out and firms still provide improvements. As a result, there are only a very small number of wire manufacturers capable of filling this order. The geometry of the wire is critical, as is the quality of construction - damaging the insulation on any of the 1,100 individual conductors during weaving defeats the purpose of Litz wire, and hence the additional effort and expense our work requires.<br />3.0 Period of Performance<br />Date of Award to January 15, 2013. <br />SHIP TO: Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (WDFW) 3515 HWY 97A, Wenatchee, WA 98801 ATTN: Ben Truscott. 509.664.3148</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   <br>  1-	Price: Price will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness and for unbalanced pricing.   <br>  2-	Past Performance: This factor will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on whether the past performance submitted for consideration is relevant and demonstrates successful past performance by the vendor, such as: no terminations for default, no ratings less than satisfactory by its customers/references, whether the quality of its work was satisfactory and completed in a timely manner and whether  the vendor demonstrated reasonableness and cooperation during performance of the contracts. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of unacceptable past performance.

Unknown shall be considered acceptable. The Past Performance is considered to be not relevant if it is not similar in work, as described in Para. 1.6 of the attached Performance Work Statement,  if it is not completed in the last five years from the date of this solicitation and if the magnitude is under $25,000.00 (Euro 18,102.50).The Government will conduct a past performance assessment on all contracts submitted by the vendor on the attached Past Performance Questionnaire.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 30 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 12 Dec 2012. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered and posted. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>***THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS BEING EXTENDED.***<br /><br />As part of the due diligence of each country's proposal, The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) conducts cost-benefit analysis to assess proposed projects' likely economic impact and cost-effectiveness and estimate the share of the population who may benefit from the program. Thus, MCC is seeking a results reporting analyst to support the results reporting function of the division by carrying out basic data analysis, database management, data entry, report layout and production, and web site support.
<p>This position is located in the Department of Policy and Evaluation (DPE). The incumbent serves as Results Reporting Analyst within the Monitoring and Evaluation Division (M&amp;E) of DPE. The analyst will report to the Managing Director of M&amp;E. After a Compact is entered into with an eligible country, focusing on results during implementation, the division is responsible for, among other things, monitoring the economic impact of Compact interventions on household income and poverty reduction within the country.</p>
<p>The contract will be for a Personal Services Contractor (PSC). A personal services contract is different from the usual non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by FAR 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSC is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (FAR 7.502). By law and by the terms of their personal services contract, the PSC is subject to most of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances, and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction applies only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system. <br />(End of instructions)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items are materially unbalanced. Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well. <BR> <BR>

<a href="mailto:Miller.Ross@epa.gov">Miller.Ross@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The following is supplemental information to the CASC Special Notice posted on 12/12/2012.
As you may be aware, the Analytical Services Branch (ASB) is preparing a joint solicitation for organic and inorganic services under the Combined Analytical Services Contracts (CASC).  The solicitation is scheduled for release in March of 2013.  For those labs that would like to test the effectiveness of their SEDD electronic reporting capabilities for CASC, EPA is making available its test version of the Electronic Data Exchange and Evaluation System (EXES) that is being developed to support the CASC program.  Further information is available on FedBizOpps at the following link:
https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=ff2eb44c92a2e80a41cd620ffe799a4a&tab=core&_cview=0
The Inorganic (ISM02.0) and Organic (SOM02.X (Draft)) SOWs are also available on the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) web site under Future Routine Analytical Services at:
http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/analytic.htm
We welcome you to take advantage of this opportunity to utilize the EXES test system for CASC.
The purpose of the CASC solicitation is to procure the services of multiple analytical chemistry laboratories, sufficient to provide analytical capacity to support EPA?s Superfund analytical requirements. EPA CLP may also be required to support other environmental programs requiring the specialized services provided by CLP.  This procurement represents a continuing requirement for the EPA?s Superfund Program, and the draft Statements of Work (SOWs) for this solicitation may be found on the CLP web site at http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/analytic.htm under the heading Future Routine Analytical Services.
For the first time, EPA is soliciting both organic and inorganic laboratory services under one solicitation.  In the past, these services were procured under separate solicitations.  Offerors will be able to propose on one, or both, services.  Some contract laboratories have held separate, but concurrent, contracts for organic and inorganic services.  It is anticipated that permitting laboratories the opportunity to be awarded a single contract for both organic and inorganic services would bring efficiencies to both the participating labs and EPA.  Current and future information regarding the CASC procurement will be available on EPA?s Office of Acquisition Management?s (OAM) web site at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm#solam

<DESC>RESPONSES REQUESTED FROM ALL INTERESTED FIRMS (LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES)
<p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (market survey). This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.</p>
<p>This U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District, is performing market research for the following potential construction requirement:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District (POH) has a requirement for the repair of the Laupahoehoe Breakwater which is located off the north east side of the island of Hawaii, near the Hamakua Coast. The project consists of a 200-foot long breakwater, 60-foot long wave absorber, 9.5 feet deep entrance channel, and a 7.5 feet deep turning basin. The project involves repair of the breakwater of Laupahoehoe Harbor.</p>
<p>This is a design-bid-build project.<br />The North American Industry Classification code (NAICS) is 237990 -- Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. This requirement will be awarded as a firm fixed price construction contract. The project magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This market survey is to determine the constructability and logistical requirements for the proposed breakwater repair. The Government may use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make an appropriate acquisition decision for this project. The type of solicitation issued and the manner of advertisement may depend on the responses to this sources sought synopsis.<br /><br />Respondents should also consider the geographical location of this project. Construction contracts awarded by the Army Corps of Engineers require compliance with EM 385-1-1 Safety Manual.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />A. Name of firm with address, phone number, point of contact, CAGE code or DUNS number. Indicate whether or not your firm is a U.S. firm or a foreign firm.<br />B. Size of firm including category of small business, such as 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, or SDVOSB, large business. <br />C. Firm's Bonding Capability and Capacity, in terms of U.S. dollars (performance and payment bonds will be required).<br />D. Background information: This project will rehabilitate and repair an existing breakwater located in Laupahoehoe Small Boat Harbor, on the island of Hawaii. The work will require the grouting of centerline of the breakwater from the ocean floor to the crest, placement of four (4) existing 30-ton armor units in the assigned placement area at the head of the breakwater, and repair of dislodged stones on the armor layer revetment.&nbsp; A detailed scope of work is provided in the attachments.&nbsp; The grouting work entails drilling from the crest of the breakwater down to the existing seafloor and grouting the breakwater from the bottom up.&nbsp; The required drilling pattern for each breakwater cell is shown in the attached section.&nbsp; The outer rows of the grouting will require a grout mix with an initial set time of 20 seconds or less and have a 28-day compressive strength of 1,200 psi and the inner row of the grouting will require a 3 to 5 inch slump with a 28-day compressive&nbsp;strength of 5,000 psi.&nbsp; For the placement of the four (4) additional concrete armor units, it is assumed that the crane shall be operated on the location shown on the attached plan. Structural details have been provided to show dimensions of the existing breakwater structure.&nbsp; It is the contractor's responsibility to repair any damages to the breakwater and replace armor units that are damaged during the placement process.&nbsp; <br />E.&nbsp; The State/County roadway systems generally consists of two (2) lanes (one lane each direction, with 11 to 12 feet wide lanes). The access road to the small boat harbor is approximately 15 feet wide with a typical grade of approximately 2% with some areas having a grade up to 5%. There exists a 10-ton capacity bridge (15 feet wide x 50 feet long) over a stream crossing along the access road to the project site.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the crane needed for this project will be mobilized from off island and will be transported by vessel to Hilo Harbor. The crane and required supplies/material shall then be transported on existing State and Local roadways from Hilo Harbor to Laupahoehoe Small Boat Harbor.</p>
<p>F. Answer specifically the following market survey questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The anticipated depth of drilling required varies from 9 feet to 30 feet.&nbsp; Does the contractor have capability of drilling through this range of depths through basalt armor stones ranging from one (1) to seven (7) tons in size?&nbsp; If yes, what is the maximum diameter hole that can be drilled without requiring a custom bit size?&nbsp; Would air track or hydraulic drilling be used?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; What method of grouting would be proposed to achieve a bottom up placement?<br /><br />3. Does the contractor have previous experience with placement/handling of concrete armor units in a marine environment? Provide a brief synopsis of the previous experience.&nbsp; Ensure the following is covered: description and location of project; type and weight of armor unit; approximate contract cost; contractor's role, i.e. was the work accomplished by the contractor or was the contractor's previous experience as a prime and armor work done by a sub-contractor.</p>
<p>4. Does the contractor have access to equipment to accomplish the work given the constraints noted in the project description? If yes, what are the dimensions and weight of such equipment? What model of equipment would be used for the work?&nbsp; Would temporary measures be required to work safely on the breakwater?&nbsp; If yes, describe the measures that would be used to work safely on the breakwater.</p>
<p>5. Can the equipment and necessary supplies/materials be transported to the project site intact? <br />a. Does the weight of the equipment and supplies/material exceed the allowable bridge capacity? If yes, what measures would be taken to reinforce the bridge? <br />b. OR If the equipment has to be broken down for transport, what is the approximate area of the footprint required to reassemble the equipment at the project site?</p>
<p>Where to send responses: <br />Submit responses to Dayna Matsumura via email at Dayna.N.Matsumura@usace.army.mil</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT.     <br>  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  <br>    <br>  1.	 Purpose.  The purpose of this project is to rehabilitate the spillway gates at Harlan County Lake's Dam.   It is anticipated that no more than 2 to 3 gates will be rehabilitated in a contract.  <br>    <br>  2.	Dam Location and Description. Harlan County Dam is located on the Republican River in south-central Nebraska near Alma, NE. The dam was built in the early 1950's as part of a flood control/irrigation project.  The dam is combined earth-rolled embankment and concrete gravity dam. The concrete section includes a controlled spillway regulated by 18 Tainter Gates, 9 sluice gates and two irrigation outlets. The Tainter gates are 40 feet wide and 30 feet high and located between piers located 48 feet on center. The existing piers are constructed of an 8 feet wide section above the spillway weir. The piers resist forces imposed by the water and Tainter gates under various water levels and gate configurations. The piers also carry loads from the bridge that spans between the piers. The reinforcing in the piers is typically spaced at 12 inches on center vertically and horizontally, with 4   quote mark  concrete cover.  The spillway bridge above the Tainter Gates is simple span with 18 spans.  The cast-in-place deck and sidewalks are supported by steel girders, floorbeams and stringers.  The steel members are non-composite with the deck.  <br>    <br>  3.	 Project Description.  The work in this project will consist of strengthening structural steel components of the gate, replacing the existing trunnion and bearing with new components, replace tainter gate chain, repair or replace electrical systems, and blast and paint the gate.  Challenging components to the contract are access to the gate, shoring of the gate, and installation of major mechanical and structural components.  <br>    <br>  4.	Access.  The ogee of the spillway at Harlan County is steep.  The reservoir will be regulated by the sluice gates during gate modifications, indicating an appreciable tailwater will be present.  The bridge across the dam cannot be permanently closed during construction and has limited capacity (see paragraph 5).  It is anticipated that shoring the tainter gate and replacing the trunnion will occur from accessing the downstream side.  Partially filling the stilling basin with gravel for crane access may be acceptable.  Other means submitted by the Contractor will be considered.  <br>    <br>  5.	Bridge.  As part of the work plan that shall be approved prior to starting work, the contractor shall provide the pattern and magnitude of loads imposed by the specific crane they plan to use for all expected lifting conditions required for the work and permit load rating calculations in accordance with AASHTO MBE to ensure they do not exceed the capacity of the bridge. The minimum recommended permit live load factor is 1.4, the minimum impact factor is 1.0, and the capacity of the bridge shall account for the bottom flange width reduction of 1-inch as noted in the calculations.  The loading configurations and calculations are required to be submitted for USACE approval to ensure overloading the bridge does not occur.  <br>    <br>  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND/OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).

<DESC>This RFI/Sources Sought Amendment is issued to clarify two issues/errors.<br /><br />1) The page limitation for submitted capability statements is not to exceed five (5) pages (plus any GSA/published commercial/catalog pricing information).<br /><br />2) The period of performance (POP) identifed in the draft PWS is subject to change.&nbsp; Prior to release of any solicitation, these dates will be revisited.&nbsp; The&nbsp;reference to the POP in the draft PWS is corrected to&nbsp;read:<br /><br />Base Period: 1 February 2013 through 31 January 2014 <br />Option Period 1: 1 February 2014 through 31 January 2015<br />Option Period 2: 1 February 2015 through 31 January 2016<br /><br />..........................................................................<br /><br />Request for Information M00264-13-RFI-0204<br />Genealogy Research Support Services
<p>PURPOSE: This Request for Information (RFI) is an effort to conduct market research for use in formulating an acquisition plan/strategy to obtain support services to provide assistance to Headquarters Marine Corps Deputy Commandant, Manpower &amp; Reserve Affairs (DC,M&amp;RA), Casualty Section (MFPC) in the area of genealogy research supporting POW/MIA Affairs. This RFI allows potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The M&amp;RA Casualty Section is responsible for identifying maternal relatives of Marines unaccounted for from past wars to donate a Family Reference Sample (FRS) for DNA testing. The Contractor is required to provide the labor, supplies, materials, and facilities to assist the Casualty Section in locating family members of over 3,000 Marines previously unaccounted for from World War II, approximately 30 Marines unaccounted for from the Vietnam War and the Korean War, and to locate family members of Marines previously recovered and identified from the Vietnam War, the Korean War and the Cold War, when additional remains are recovered and identified. Previous support was provided under contract number M00264-10-D-0005.</p>
<p>CORE OBJECTIVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED: The draft Performance Work Statement provided with this RFI sets forth the work efforts required to support genealogy research. Cases are individually assigned and worked. The scope of this effort shall encompass the following objectives/tasks:</p>
<p>- The contractor will first attempt to find the Marine's Next of Kin (NOK), as defined by DODI 1300.18.<br />- The contractor will report all potential NOK found as a result of the genealogy search. The contractor will report the NOK's contact information to MFPC. MFPC will contact the family and if it is confirmed they are maternally related, the file may be closed.<br />- The contractor will respond with the NOK's contact information as required within 72 hours of receipt of the request from MFPC. Information attained from the contractor must result in a successful contact with a NOK 90% of the time. <br />- Should the NOK not be maternally related to the Marine, the contractor will report NOK contact information to MFPC and proceed to TASK 4(2).<br />- Should an attempt to find the Marine's NOK be unsuccessful, the contractor should inform MFPC and proceed to TASK 4(2).<br />- When either the Marine's NOK is not maternally related or the NOK could not be located, the contractor should attempt to find two living paternal relatives of the Marine.<br />- Should two living paternal relatives of the Marine be found, the contractor should report all information to the MFPC. <br />- When it is determined that only one or no paternal relatives will be located, the contractor will report all available information to MFPC. <br />- The contractor will utilize MFPC's standardized spreadsheet to report progress/successful contacts on a weekly basis. Reports will be submitted on time and be error free 90% of the time.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI shall not exceed five (5) pages, including cover letter, discussion and contact information. Subject response must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives; (2) Two customer references describing similar work efforts; (3) Commercial published labor categories and rates used by respondents for similar services (if available- this does not count against the 5 page limit); and (4) Other material relevant to establishing the core competencies of the firm. Please identify Large/Small Business size, CAGE Code and GSA Schedule contract number if available.</p>
<p>Response is due by 3 January 2013, 3:00 PM. Please submit e-mail responses to Lawrence Rice, Customer Liaison, at: Lawrence.rice@usmc.mil</p>
<p>NOTES: Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation. The Marine Corps is neither seeking proposals nor accepting unsolicited proposals, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. See FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. Insert: Information ONLY.</p>

<p>Marine Corps Systems Command hereby&nbsp;releases a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the potential award up to two (2) contracts for the Research, Development, and Prototype fabrication of a Medium Hybrid Expeditionary Energy System (MHEES). The contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP), "C" type contracts.&nbsp;All contracts will have base efforts that perform initial analysis, design efforts, and fabrication/delivery of prototypes. The period of performance for this effort will be twenty-four&nbsp;(24) months.<br /><br />To increase energy independence and flexibility of deployment options, the Marine Corps has been fielding renewable and hybrid energy programs to include the Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS). Need for improvement exists with this type of system to meet future Marine Corps&nbsp;mission needs for mobility and power. The goal of this improvement will be to address the next level of power capability above the GREENS type system, while developing the smallest, lightest and most cost effective system at this increased power level.<br /><br />See attachments for RFP instructions and specifics.</p>

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA SAO East - 240E - Contracting Office is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.
