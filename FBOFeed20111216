<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract action to Raytheon pursuant to 10U.S.C  2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of Goddard Space FlightCenters (GSFC) Applied Engineering and Technical Directorate (AETD).  This procurementwill increase the IDIQ maximum ordering value of Contract NNG09CP01C with Raytheon inorder to allow completion of a current task order under the contract.This sole source action is necessary to support the technology development and hardwaredelivery of a high efficiency Planar Waveguide Er:Yb:Glass laboratory prototype amplifierfor the ASCENDS program that started in April 2011 for a duration of 2 years.  Theadditional funds will allow the continuance of this development effort by Raytheon on theeye safe laser amplifier.  The Raytheon design is baselined on the same innovative butproprietary development effort that has proven to be very successful in demonstratingpower scaling of laser energy for space applications.  The planned action is necessary inorder to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significanttechnical impacts to the AETD and supporting directorates.Raytheon is required to provide support in the completion of the delivery of the PlanarWaveguide (PWG) Er:Yb:Glass laboratory prototype amplifier.Raytheon has the combined training, experience, and expertise to provide uninterruptedcontinuation of mission critical support.  Due to the time and substantial duplication ofcosts involved in procuring this work from another contractor, Raytheon is considered theonly contractor that can meet GSFC's needs given the short period of performance. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified points of contact not later than 5:00PM EDT onDecember 31, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The installation Ombudsman is NancyAbell at (301) 286-5867.

<DESC>On the behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 2, located in Edison New Jersey, the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate, Boise, Idaho plans to issue a commercial item solicitation and evaluate offers under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and award a contract for a contractor operated and maintained, exclusive use, light helicopter to conduct surveys of the waters of the New York/New Jersey Harbor Complex.  The contract period is for one base year with four one-year option periods.  The service performance period under each year will be about 110 calendar days from approximately May 21st through September 7th.  This action will be total small business set-aside. The NAICS Code is 481211, Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation, and the small business size standard is 1,500 employees. Flights will be conducted six days a week at low levels to observe and record "slicks" of floating debris that could wash up on area beaches. Once a slick is spotted, the helicopter hovers or circles the area to allow the observer to determine and document slick content, location, size and possible origin. Slicks typically consist of paper, plastic, bottles, large wood and natural debris. Information is given to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who uses skimmer vessels to remove any debris. Flights are conducted early in the morning with one or two observers as passengers. Flights will be conducted from a helipad adjacent to the EPA=BFs Edison office and typically last one hour from takeoff to landing. If a water sampling flight is not scheduled for the same day, the contractor will be released from duty at the conclusion of each daily harbor flight. Water sampling with the helicopter is scheduled once a week and is conducted after the low level harbor flight. The helicopter door is removed for the sampling equipment and an EPA observer/sampler rides in the back seat. The helicopter hovers over individual sampling stations located via GPS. The observer/sampler lowers a sampling device called a Kemmerer down into the water to collect the appropriate amount of volume. There are 26 stations along Long Island, and it takes approximately 2.5 hours to complete the entire run of stations.  The New Jersey run includes 16 stations and takes approximately 3 hours to complete. The Long Island and New Jersey runs are conducted on alternate weeks, weather permitting.  The Government will direct aircraft to support its missions and objectives. An electronic copy of the solicitation will be available for download at www.fedbizopps.gov approximately January 7, 2012.  The apparent successful offeror must be registered in CCR (www.ccr.gov) in order to be awarded the contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

In the event that the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC) cannot support an initial acquisition course for a unit deploying or conversion training generated by a formal documented change in mission or MTOE (Modified Table of Equipment), the contractor may be required to perform acquisition or conversion training.  Reserve Component (RC) units from all services are trained in full-time study during two-week annual training periods and on Saturday and Sunday monthly drill weekends.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified business sources under the six task categories defined below; (2) whether the capable organizations are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method(s), including whether a set-aside in a specific category is possible. Any qualified organization under the applicable NAICS code may submit a response to this notice.
<p>Organizations must have the capability to perform the following task categories:</p>
<p>A. Background Information</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) was established in 1974, and in 1992 it became part of the National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services. NIDA's mission is to "...lead the Nation in bringing the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction." NIDA supports over 85 percent of the world's research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction. NIDA-supported science addresses the most fundamental and essential questions about drug abuse, ranging from the molecule to managed care, and from DNA to community outreach research.</p>
<p>NIDA is currently seeking systems for data management, statistical support, document management and information technology support and services. The systems will provide an enterprise-wide architecture for NIDA's Information Technology needs. The systems will be used to support data analysis, information exchange, scientific discovery efforts and clinical evaluation of promising new anti-addiction therapies and companion behavioral interventions in order to further NIDA's mission.</p>
<p><strong>1. Clinical Trial Support (Category 1)<br /></strong><br />NIDA conducts single and multi-site clinical trials through grants, contracts and cooperative agreements in sites located across the nation. These are usually studies of behavioral, pharmacological, and integrated behavioral and pharmacological treatment interventions in rigorous, clinical trials to determine effectiveness, practicality, and feasibility across a broad range of treatment settings and diversified patient populations and to transfer research results to physicians, clinicians, providers, and patients. Actual clinical trials will not be conducted under this contract. Activities will support the trials carried out under cooperative agreements or other funding mechanisms. Some of the requirements include:<br /><br />a. Clinical Trial Management<br /><br />i. Establish and administer electronic and web-based systems for the collection, management, and storage of study data;</p>
<p>ii. Review and monitor the quality of study data; perform ongoing data checks and data error resolutions;</p>
<p>iii. Provide support for protocol development including creation of electronic Case Report Forms;</p>
<p>iv. Establish and maintain an electronic and web-based system for monitoring multiple trial progress in near real time, with password protected access, pertinent documents, parameters to be determined by NIDA from its current web-based system;</p>
<p>v. Provide input to NIDA's Clinical Coordinating Center(s) that will help identify issues to be pursued during site visits, and that will facilitate the monitors' data verification efforts.</p>
<p>vi. Coordinate with the NIDA's Clinical Coordinating Center(s) and study teams.</p>
<p>b. Statistical Design and Analysis</p>
<p>In collaboration with lead Investigators, develop the statistical sections of the protocols, including study design, randomization and stratification methods, power and sample size calculations, and plans for interim and final data analyses Prepare interim reports for each clinical trial's Data and Safety Monitoring Board and for NIDA.<br />The organization will work closely with lead Investigators and NIDA in the performing of final statistical analyses, the reporting of trial results and the preparation and writing of scientific reports and manuscripts for publication.<br /><br /><strong>2. Document Management System (Category 2)</strong></p>
<p>NIDA needs a FISMA compliant, web-based application that constitutes a core service for document management, virtual team collaboration, information retrieval, and business process automation. The application would need to support at least 600 individual password protected users across the United States and territories (and possibly other countries) and more than 60 GB of unstructured data (currently comprising MS Word documents, MS Excel Spreadsheets, Powerpoint presentations, pdfs, etc.) The application must accommodate the functionality for external communications needed to allow off-site Government and non-Government collaborators, contractors and grantees to upload, retrieve and collaborate on documents, data and reports to the system. The system must allow passing documents behind and through the NIH Firewall. The ideal solution would be accomplished with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) application or COTS software packages with minimal customization to allow interoperability between programs.</p>
<p>NIDA currently uses Livelink from Open Text as its document management and knowledge management tool. The successful solution must be able to accomplish the successful transfer/migration of those files contained in Livelink into whatever application solution is proposed.</p>
<p>Coordination and collaboration with other organizations may be necessary to ensure compatibility with other data systems in use by NIDA.</p>
<p><strong>3. Data Management System (Category 3)</strong></p>
<p>a. Data Repository</p>
<p>NIDA needs a logical (and sometimes physical) partitioning of data where multiple databases that apply to specific applications or sets of applications can reside. The repository must be able to accommodate legacy (historical) clinical trial data, and legacy pre-clinical data, that is currently stored, as well as data from future studies. The solution must permit the incorporation of data from several clinical data acquisition centers that collect and consolidate data from single or multi-center clinical projects</p>
<p>Organizations must be able to provide all standard clinical data repository activities including:</p>
<p>i. Defining additional requirements, <br />ii. Designing, building, implementing, testing and maintaining the repository,<br />iii. Analyzing source systems for additional data feeds, <br />iv. Consulting in the development of clinical data system standards, <br />v. Collaborating in the development of system interfaces to the repository, <br />vi. Executing, incremental data loads to the repository from protocol-specific source systems and other study management systems.</p>
<p>The environment must allow scientific data archiving to ensure that the integrity of, and access to, the data remains available over time to support data sharing efforts.</p>
<p>Coordination and collaboration with other organizations may be necessary to ensure compatibility with other data systems in use by NIDA.</p>
<p>b. Data Warehouse</p>
<p>NIDA needs a "Data Warehouse" that transforms information from clinical trials, including all legacy data, to the form of a relational database that will allow web or text mining to transform or aggregate it into useful information for research. In addition, the "Data Warehouse" must be capable of accepting data from outside sources (i.e. grantees, other contractors, collaborators, etc.). It is anticipated that data from these sources would come from uniform data capture instruments and/or would comply with the central data dictionary.</p>
<p>Having the ability to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform and load data, and to create/manage a central data dictionary are considered essential features of the system. The warehouse will normalize clinical trial data to permit cross study data analyses down to the individual variable level. In addition, organizations should have the ability to analyze data on the behalf of NIDA by performing analyses on individual study datasets or on individual study variables across studies (Meta-analyses.)</p>
<p>Data are expected to move from the data warehouse to the data repository once data are normalized. Coordination and collaboration with other organizations may be necessary during protocol development of clinical trials (see 1.a.iii) as well as after data collection to ensure compatibility with other data systems in use by NIDA.</p>
<p>Coordination and collaboration with other organizations may be necessary to ensure compatibility with other data systems in use by NIDA.</p>
<p>c. Data sharing</p>
<p>To ensure that future research can build on previous efforts and discoveries, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a data sharing policy that expects final research data, especially unique data, from NIH-supported research efforts to be made available to other investigators. Data sharing applies to human subjects and laboratory research. In some instances, it may include data not produced with NIH funding but used in an NIH-supported activity.</p>
<p>In order to be compliant with this policy, and provide access to NIDA clinical trial data, NIDA needs a controlled, secure environment in which eligible researchers can access, request, and obtain clinical trial data in formats that will facilitate various analyses using those data resources.</p>
<p>The organization will create a data mart(s) which will allow for the creation of customized clinical datasets that accommodate researcher data analysis requests.</p>
<p>Coordination and collaboration with other organizations may be necessary to ensure compatibility with other data systems in use by NIDA.</p>
<p><strong>4. Research Support Application Development (Category 4</strong>)</p>
<p>Occasionally NIDA will have a need for the development of a software solution to support data analysis aspects of its pre-clinical, and clinical, research and development programs. The ideal solution will be accomplished with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software or with COTS software packages with minimal customization to allow interoperability between programs. The solutions should be able to operate as stand-alone programs that are easily maintained.</p>
<p>a. Engage in requirements gathering with NIDA staff and/or external users<br />b. Provide an analysis of the scope of development (Scope Document)<br />c. Program the code<br />d. Ensure compliance with NIH software policies (including FISMA).<br />e. Beta-Test the program<br />f. Document the internal design of the software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement throughout development process.<br />g. Deploy the software<br />h. Provide training and support</p>
<p>An example of such a system would be a Pre-clinical compound Evaluation and Tracking System that would allow for the incorporation of clinical structures and clinical, pharmacological and toxicological information into an easily searchable database. The system is utilized to review and compare compounds to determine their potential to be developed as addiction medications. The solution will also include the ability to authorize and track shipments of compounds to contract research laboratories and allow relevant reports and scientific information to be incorporated and linked to a specific compound.<br /><br /><strong>5. Consultant Support (Category 5)</strong></p>
<p>a. Support for EHR/EMR Project<br />Provide a variety of support for medical record development for a consensus-based, standardized core set of common data elements (CDEs) on drug use disorders to support clinical decision support, clinical performance measures, and interoperability in vendor electronic (EMR) products and SUD clinical research. NIDA's efforts to develop CDEs for substance abuse have been directed first to developing a hierarchy for domains, subdomains and core questions, which have then been reviewed at workshops and symposia to obtain feedback by experts in clinical care and clinical research across a broad range of stakeholders in the federal government, state government, community treatment providers, large health care providers, primary and specialty care practitioners as members of various professional organizations, and vendors of electronic medical record products. Future efforts will likely follow similar lines, but may require efforts to field test the proposed EMR or CDEs.<br />Coordination and collaboration with other organizations may be necessary to ensure compatibility with other systems in use by NIDA.<br />b. General Consultant Services</p>
<p>Provide general IT and scientific consultation, across various disciplines in areas such as development of best practices, design of pre-clinical and clinical studies, identification of scientific gaps and medication development.</p>
<p><strong>6. Information Technology Hardware and Infrastructure Support and Maintenance (Category 6)<br /><br /></strong>Organizations shall be responsible for the following:<br /><br />a. Provide technical support to NIDA in the areas of database and systems infrastructure for the development and production environments according to established NIH enterprise architecture standards, policies, and procedures.</p>
<p>b. Provide technical support to guarantee the performance, reliability, scalability, availability, manageability, security and recoverability of servers, firewalls, networking components, workstations, software, Oracle databases and applications in the development, production or staging environments.</p>
<p>c.

<p>d. Provide technical support to the development environment located at the organizations site and the production and staging environments located at NIDA.</p>
<p>e. Interface with NIDA-IRMB, NIH-CIT, and NIH-ATDP to perform administration and maintenance of the NIDA CISCO firewall and the NIH Perimeter firewall in the production environment.</p>
<p>f. Provide a disaster recovery strategy, along with its corresponding SOPs, where all project servers are fully backed up to tape media.</p>
<p>g. Supplement the tape backup strategy, along with its corresponding SOPs, with the use of server snapshot software, which takes and archives snapshots of the project servers.</p>
<p>h. Configure all severs and networking equipment with redundant fail-over hardware components.</p>
<p>i. Remotely monitor and manage the development and production environments.</p>
<p>j. Provide database administration support to ensure the performance, reliability, scalability, availability, manageability, security and recoverability of the engagement's development and production databases.</p>
<p>k. Provide all-aspects of database administration, configuration and support to the project team during the design, development, testing, and implementation and maintenance stages of the application.</p>
<p>l. Provide technical support to guarantee availability of all systems and Oracle databases in the development, production and staging environments during the specified hours of operations.</p>
<p>m. Provide expertise to project teams with regards to design, procurement, testing, implementation and maintenance of complex, high-availability infrastructure architectures.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.  This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, and a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research.
 
The Department of Navy (DoN) seeks to streamline the acquisition process by taking advantage of innovative e-procurement technologies that will assist DoN in leveraging resources, reducing administrative tasks and associated labor costs, while ensuring regulatory compliance to maintain high levels of competition, obtain reasonable prices, and meet socio-economic goals.
  Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government's stated requirements. DoN is seeking professional web-based reverse auctioning services that allow the DoN buyers to post specific requirements to obtain offers for commodities and services from different suppliers within the provider network maintained by the Reverse Auction Service Provider.  The goal is to reduce direct and indirect purchase costs and to capture detailed spend data. Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas:

This web-enabled reverse auctioning interface shall permit buyers to conduct real-time competed auctions by posting online reverse auction formatted solicitations, utilize best value award criteria, and establish auction start/end times.
  The system shall be versatile to allow buyers to have complete control of the process to post auctions, cancel auctions at any time if it is in the best interest of the Government, and make award to any supplier within the offer pool.  In addition, the contractor shall work with DoN to develop additional reverse auctioning system capabilities and features as mutually agreed by the parties. 

Buyers shall have the ability to set a target price, optionally set the criteria for selecting the winner(s), include DoN terms and conditions, and set a specified start and end date of each auction.  At the end of the auction, the buyer shall have the option to select the winner(s) manually.

Suppliers shall be able to submit a successively lower offer and see whether their submitted offer is leading or lagging behind the lead bid or target price established via current market research completed by government buyers.
   Suppliers shall not have knowledge of the other offers posted or suppliers participating in the auction to anonymously compete for a DoN requirement.  Contractors who believe that they posses the expertise and experience to fulfill all of these requirements are invited to submit technical and management capabilities addressing each of these areas in writing. Interested contractors should also address their business process in regards to payment method (e.g., subscription vs. transaction fee) as well as whether they can fulfill the requirements via GSA schedules.

Please send responses via e-mail to david.felling@navy.mil by close of business on 6 January 2012. Please limit your response to no more than five pages.
 For any questions, please contact David Felling at 757-443-1964.

Interested organizations must demonstrate and document concisely their extensive experience and recommendations as part of this announcement. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as proprietary information. 

Responses to the RFI will not be returned nor will receipt be confirmed. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

Also include information such as: Company name, address, email, telephone number, points of contact, CAGE code, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and whether your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.
 (4) Is your firm a certified HUBZone firm (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting this market search to determine the capabilities of potential small business sources in preparation for a future procurement. Information submitted in response to this notice is merely used for internal market research purposes and no feedback will be offered to the interested parties that submit capability statements.
The EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) has a requirement for contractor(s) to provide external peer reviews of Agency products. These external peer reviews may be both scientific and technical in nature.  The successful contractor(s) shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment and facilities in support of the efforts delineated by the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http:www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages submitted by respondents are as follows : Capable to perform at a minimum 20 peer reviews simultaneously involving scientific/technical peer reviews of documents and materials related to the following topics: 1) complex chemical-specific hazard assessments; 2) background documents that include toxicological reviews on hazard identification, dose-response information and risk characterization, human health and ecological risk assessments, can cer and non-cancer assessments provisionally developed for Superfund Risk Assessors, and various advanced statistical methodologies applied to hazard assessment modeling; 3) research plans and proposals dealing with the application of state-of-the-science approaches for conducting hazard assessments; 4) scientific and technical reviews; 5) Agency work products; and 6) preparation of instructional materials to communicate highly technical guidelines and standards related to health or the environment. It is anticipated that the solicitation will contemplate a multiple award performance-based indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity task order contract(s). Task orders may be issued on a firm-fixed-price or time-and-materials basis. On rare occasions task orders may be issued on a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), level of effort, completion or term basis. The ordering period established under the contract(s) will be five years. 
The applicable NAICS code is 541990 (All Other Professional Scientific, and Technical Services) with a size standard of $7 million in annual receipts. ANY INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESS may submit a capability statement which clearly demonstrates its management, scientific and technical capabilities to perform the key requirements described above. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis. In the capabilities statements, responders should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern. As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. Responses to the above should be submitted to growne y.matthew@epa.gov no later than 15 calendar days from the date of posting.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers proposals and are in descending order of importance: 1) Past Performance and 2) Price. Factors 1 and 2 will be applied to determine the best value to the Government. Past Performance shall be considered significantly more important than price (factor 2).<br />In accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified or FAR 19.1404, if your firm is a SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer for this acquisition, please respond by email to Sarah Rall at sarah.j.rall@uscg.mil. Questions may also be referred to Sarah Rall at this email address and by phone at (757) 628-4663. In response, please include the following: (a) positive statement of your intent to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers. Note: At the time of solicitation, when proposals are due, if two companies are planning to conduct business as a Joint Venture or any other type of teaming agreement they shall provide past performance on projects of similar scope that they have performed together as a Joint Venture. Providing individual past performance documentation from each company on separate projects where the two did not work together is not considered to be sufficient past performance. A Joint Venture that cannot provide this requested information will not be considered to have sufficient documentation needed to evaluate past performance as an evaluation factor. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set-aside or SDVOSB set-aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set Aside or 52.219-27 or Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside will apply, which requires that at least fifty (50) percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUBZone small business concerns.<br />Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in FAR Clause 52.232-33. CCR can be obtained by accessing the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423. Your response is required by 2:00 p.m. EST, January 3, 2012. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside. Failure to submit all information requested may result in a small business set-aside. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone or SDVOSB set aside will be posted on the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, in support of Product Manager - Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, is conducting a market research investigation for blast protective gloves. The goal of this effort is to identify firms with capabilities to provide/design/develop gloves for use by the combat Soldier during combat operations in an effort to provide additional protection over the current Army Combat Glove. The gloves must be capable of meeting critical technical and uniform requirements as follows: 1) Available in a subdued color. 2) Made of leather, inherently flame resistant materials, or a combination of the two, and all findings that will not ignite, melt, or drip onto the flesh in flash flame conditions. 3) Provide excellent dexterity and tactility with which writing with a pen/pencil and firing a weapon are easily achievable tasks. 4) Integrate textiles and/or materials designed to provide blast protection greater than current combat handwear with focus on protecting against ballistically propelled dirt, rocks and debris on the back of the hand and fingers. 5) Provide impact protection for the base of the palm as well as the knuckles. 6) Provide excellent durability when worn daily and in contact with abrasive/rough materials. 7) Wrist closure that will prevent debris from entering the glove and does not restrict timely donning and doffing.  8) Five fingered design curved and shaped to the relaxed position of the hand. 9) Have a storage loop/cord extending  " from the cuff/wrist base of the glove. Interested sources must, by 29 December 2011, respond with detailed information on their current product(s) and how they are made or could be modified to address the U.S. Army requirement. Interested sources shall include detailed information regarding their firm's experience, personnel, facilities and domestic production capability. Product information should include product cost, technical information (e.g. technical literature, data and illustrations, technical certifications), performance capabilities, independent laboratory test results, and relevant company background/experience, and product sample if available. If a firm chooses to submit a sample, no payment will be made by the government for such sample. Firms should provide pricing for currently available product and/or estimated pricing for gloves currently under development. Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business. This notice is for market research only. Responses to this notice are to be sent to Ms. Stacey Lee, U.S. Army Natick Soldier RDEC, RDNS-WPW-C, Bldg #4 Room D236, Natick, MA 01760-5019. This is not a request for quotations. No solicitation document exists. The information received under this announcement may be used to purchase items for Government testing and/or for developing acquisition strategy.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Heidi Shorter, Chula Vista, CA.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The Spatial Orientation Center (SOC), Naval Medical Center San Diego requires technical support for experiments concerning blast overpressure effects on traumatic brain injury and effects of exposures to continuous and impulsive noise on hearing and balance in a rodent model. <br>The services required are:<br>o technical support for research proposals and protocols<br>o experiments to evaluate process of blast-induced neurological injury and of noise induced hearing loss <br>o treatments and/or prevention of blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury and inner ear injury<br>o application of expertise of small animal models to blast overpressure and noise induced biochemical oxidative stress<br>o employ methodologies to evaluate investigational agents and compounds to protect/restore neurological and cognitive function to blast-induced injury<br>o surgical preparation and implantation of devices and methods to repairing or renewal of sensory tissues to return or recover function<br>o Collect and record data from investigations and maintain the experimental database<br>o Logistic support and recordkeeping for studies with the Animal Research Coordinator.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>Heidi Shorter has been involved in work with small animal models as an animal care specialist at the NMCSD animal facility. She has knowledge of the programs utilized by the SOC in determining behavioral, physiological, and cellular response mechanisms to blast overpressure and biochemical oxidative stress using small animal models. Heidi Shorter has monitored materials, supplies and animal inventories and has participated at various investigations at the NMCSD animal facility. As an animal care specialist she has employed various methodologies and procedures under Protocol CIP#NMCSD.2009.003 and CIP#NMCSD.2009.009. She is experienced in performing surgery on small and large animals for various NMCSD departments. The time to train a new animal research technician to perform on par with Heidi Shorter would hinder any new and ongoing developments by the SOC.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>The SBA Dynamic Small Business Search returned no small businesses associated with both the NAICS 541690 and any of the keywords animal research, rodent models, audiological.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>None<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>None<br><br>6.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information Regarding the Reinsurance Program under the Affordable Care Act
<SOLNBR>HHS-CMS-DBSC-RFI-11-621
<RESPDATE>011612
<ARCHDATE>02162012
<CONTACT>Brian J Humes, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-787-8898, Email brian.humes@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request for Information Regarding the Reinsurance Program under the Affordable Care Act</span></strong>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> This notice is a request for information (RFI) to gain market information on entities that could administer a transitional reinsurance program. This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides that each State must establish a transitional reinsurance program to help stabilize premiums for coverage in the individual market during the first three years of Exchange operation (2014-2016). On July 15, 2011, the Departments of Health and Human Services (CMS) published a proposed rule regarding the reinsurance program and other premium stabilization components of the ACA. The proposed rule provides standards to States establishing or contracting with a not-for-profit reinsurance entity responsible for carrying out the transitional reinsurance program, including collecting reinsurance contributions from issuers and third-party administrators, and calculating and disbursing reinsurance payments to eligible individual market issuers.</p>
<p>This RFI solicits information about entities that could function as a reinsurance entity for the transitional reinsurance program. CMS or one or more States may contract for services required to fulfill the statutory and regulatory requirements of the reinsurance entity. <br /><br /><strong>DATES:</strong> Submit written or electronic comments by 4:00 PM ET on January 16, 2012.<br /><br />We note that responses to this RFI are not offers, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or to issue a grant. The purpose of this RFI is to gather public comments on the proposed rules for reinsurance, risk corridors, or risk adjustment under the ACA. Those comments have been collected and are being evaluated separately. Information obtained in response to this RFI may be used by the Government for program planning and development, or other purposes with or without attribution. Do not include any information that might be considered proprietary or confidential.</p>
<p>Section 1341 of the ACA provides that each State must establish a transitional reinsurance program to help stabilize premiums for coverage in the individual market during the first three years of Exchange operation (2014-2016). The reinsurance program, which is a State-based program, will reduce the uncertainty of insurance risk in the individual market by making payments for high-cost cases. This program will attenuate individual market rate increases that might otherwise occur because of the immediate enrollment of individuals with unknown health status, potentially including, at the state's discretion, those currently in state high-risk pools. CMS published proposed rules for states and health insurance issuers for this reinsurance program on July 15, 2011 at 76 FR 41930.</p>
<p>Section 1321(c) (1) authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the reinsurance program and other components of title I of the Affordable Care Act in states that have not done so. The statute also requires that each State, or CMS on behalf of the State, establish or contract with an entity to carry out the reinsurance program. The reinsurance entity must be a not-for-profit organization with a tax-exempt status.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS:<br /></strong>This RFI seeks comment on the entities that could carry out the transitional reinsurance program. CMS may enter into one or more contracts to fulfill the statutory and regulatory requirements of the transitional reinsurance program established under section 1341 of the ACA depending on the workload and number of States that would require assistance. In such a case, the contractor may be tasked with one or more of the following functions: <br />&bull; collecting reinsurance contributions;<br />&bull; accepting and validating requests for reinsurance payments;<br />&bull; remitting reinsurance payments; <br />&bull; reconciling and verifying reinsurance contributions and payments<br />&bull; maintaining records; and,<br />&bull; providing customer support to issuers.<br /><br />CMS is seeking to engage formally, in a transparent and participatory manner, with entities that understand the reinsurance market, and would be able to perform the responsibilities of a reinsurance entity under the statute and associated regulations. In carrying out the transitional reinsurance program, CMS seeks to mitigate conflicts of interest (COI) that may arise if potential market competitors operate the reinsurance program. As such, we request any information on potential COIs, and potential avenues for mitigation, from all stakeholders, including issuers and third-party administrators. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Infrastructure Questions<br /></strong></span>(1) Does your organization operate as a not-for-profit reinsurance entity in the state(s) in which you currently conduct business? <br />(2) If your organization operates as a reinsurance entity but does not function as a not-for-profit, what steps would have to be taken to convert the organization or the part of that organization responsible for reinsurance operations into a not-for-profit entity? What other considerations should be taken into account in connection with such a conversion? <br />(3) What other steps must your organization take in order to be prepared to smoothly transition into a role as administrator of a new temporary reinsurance program? <br />(4) Does your organization operate nationally or in limited geographic areas? If the latter, what are the geographic areas?<br />(5) Would your organization be able and willing to contract with a State and/or the Federal government to operate a temporary reinsurance program? <br />(6) Are there any State and/or local licensing requirements that must be considered by an organization operating as such a reinsurance entity?<br />(7) What potential conflicts of interest (COI) could arise if your organization were to operate such a reinsurance program as a not-for-profit entity? How might these COIs be mitigated? <br />(8) For organizations that do not currently have COI mitigation programs, what steps would have to be taken to develop and execute such a program? <br />(9) What is a reasonable amount of time for your organization to become fully operational (e.g., have all systems in place to operate a reinsurance program) after the date of a contract award? What resources would be necessary?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collection and Disbursement of Reinsurance Funds Questions<br /></span></strong>(10) Describe your organization's ability to perform the following functions: <br />&bull; collecting reinsurance contributions;<br />&bull; accepting and validating requests for reinsurance payments;<br />&bull; remitting reinsurance payments; and,<br />&bull; reconciling and verifying reinsurance contributions and payments. <br />(11) What services related to the collection of reinsurance contributions, or disbursement of reinsurance payments to another entity would your organization need to subcontract due to a lack of capacity, expertise, or experience? <br />(12) What COIs could arise for such potential subcontractors?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Collection Questions<br /></span></strong>(13) Describe current data systems that are used by your organization, including any standards, security systems, and web-based interactive structure. Are your systems compliant or have the capability of being Section 508 compliant &lt;http://www.section508.gov/&gt;? <br />(14) Do your organization's current data systems have the capability to interface with external systems to accept data and reports? If yes, what types of interfaces are currently in place?<br />(15) What data are currently collected by your organization related to medical costs?<br />(16) What is your organization's current capacity for collecting and verifying claims submissions from issuers?

<DESC>This is a special notice of intent to award a contract extension on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The contract extension is necessary while a follow-on competition for the management and operation of the Sandia National Laboratories is conducted. The contract extension would be awarded to Sandia Corporation, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation. The current contract with Sandia Corporation (expiring on September 30, 2012) would be extended for a one-year base period (October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013), with two additional three-month options, to be exercised if needed.
<p>Sandia National Laboratories' (SNL) basic mission is to perform as a Multi-Program Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), while assuring accomplishment of its primary and essential assignment as a nuclear weapons research, development and engineering laboratory for NNSA's Defense Programs. SNL's major facilities are located at Albuquerque, New Mexico; Livermore, California; and at a test range near Tonopah, Nevada.</p>
<p>The current contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 with Sandia Corporation may be viewed at the following web site: http://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ouroperations/apm/mosupportdept/sandiacorp . The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 561210.</p>
<p>The extension is being sought to continue the SNL mission while NNSA completes the follow-on competition. Continuity of performance at SNL is essential, considering the unique and extraordinary national security missions that must be continued there without interruption during the timeframe of this acquisition. NNSA cannot afford the risk of disruptions to the work that is currently being performed by Sandia Corporation in managing and operating SNL.</p>
<p>This special notice of intent to award a contract extension on a sole source basis is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation for offers. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing no later than 4:00 p.m. Mountain Time, January 17, 2012. All responses and inquiries must be addressed in writing to NNSA Office of Acquisition Management (NA-APM-113.1), Attn: Stephen Sandager, PO Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185-5400, or email to Stephen.Sandager@nnsa.doe.gov . Response to this notice is not required.</p>

<DESC><strong>Request for Information (RFI): "New Experimental Medicine Studies: Fast-fail trials (FAST)" <br /></strong><br /><strong>"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and to gain information for project planning purposes." <br /></strong><br />"New Experimental Medicine Studies: Fast-fail trials (FAST)" was previously referred to in Sources Sought Notices as Small Clinical Trials to Test Feasibility and Specific Target Engagement of Novel Pharmacological Treatment in Mood and Anxiety Disorders (FAST-MA), in Psychotic Spectrum Disorders (FAST-PS), and in Autism Spectrum Disorders (FAST-AS)
<p>Note: Small Business Sources Sought Notice numbers: HHS-NIH-DA-SBSS-12-240, HHS-NIH-DA-SBSS-12-241, HHS-NIH-DA-SBSS-12-242 were previously issued on www.fbo.gov on November 10, 2011.</p>
<p>Note: Research and Development Sources Sought Notice numbers: HHS-NIH-DA-RDSS-12-240, HHS-NIH-DA-RDSS-12-241, HHS-NIH-DA-RDSS-12-242 were previously issued on www.fbo.gov on November 15, 2011. <br /><br /><strong>Background.<br /></strong><br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has recently published the above referenced Sources Sought notices for small research networks that can conduct early trials of new or repurposed compounds for treatment of mental disorders, intended to facilitate development of new therapeutics through a focus on molecular and clinical target engagement. (See: attachments of the three RDSS notices.) Three separate areas have been targeted: autism spectrum disorders, psychotic spectrum disorders, and mood/anxiety spectrum disorders. In keeping with the new NIMH RDoC program (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-funding/rdoc/index.shtml ), emphasis is placed upon the study of mechanisms associated with particular brain circuits or other neurobiological systems, as studied either within traditional DSM/ICD disorder categories or across a related spectrum of disorder categories. The major criteria for selecting research networks considered by NIMH include relevant experience and expertise of the investigators, availability of relevant patient populations in which to conduct trials, and the demonstrated capability of the research sites to conduct trials that involve the acquisition of a large and diverse number of molecular and clinical measures (e.g., PET, sMRI, fRMI, EEG/ERP, MEG, neurocognitive testing, emotion reactivity or regulation tasks).</p>
<p>The general approach NIMH intends to take for these initiatives is to follow the concept of "experimental medicine." In this instance, the term is refers to the approach outlined recently by Littman &amp; Williams (Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2005, 4:631-638):<br /><br />Experimental medicine is the use of innovative measurements, models and designs in studying human subjects for establishing proof of mechanism and concept of new drugs .... and for efficiently terminating the development of unsuccessful ones. Humans are the ultimate 'model' because of the uncertain validity and efficacy of novel targets and drug candidates that emerge from genomics, combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening and the use of poorly predictive preclinical models. The in-depth investigation of the effects of drugs and the nature of disease progression is becoming ever more feasible because of advances in clinical biomarkers.</p>
<p>Thus, the intended emphasis is upon studies in humans rather than animal models, and upon a "fast-fail" paradigm to reduce development time and costs given the well-known high failure rates in early-stage drug development. NIMH anticipates that if these research networks are instantiated, any studies that are conducted will encompass the range from Phase I to Phase IIa, depending upon a variety of factors. These include (but are not necessarily limited to) such factors as whether a given compound is new or repurposed; the extent and strength of pre-clinical data; extent of data regarding dosing; availability of measures (such as PET ligands) that can demonstrate engagement at the receptor/molecular level; and availability of measures to demonstrate engagement of clinical targets such as biomarkers, endophenotypes, or intermediate phenotypes. Further background material is available through recent papers about problems with the drug development process (e.g., Paul et al., "How to improve R&amp;D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge," Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2010, 9:203-214; the Arch2POCM project, http://sagebase.org/partners/Arch2POCM.php ).</p>
<p>The choice of the particular molecular, circuit-level or clinical mechanisms to be studied, the particular measures that will be employed to assess these mechanisms, and the choice of compounds to be studied is anticipated to be determined by the NIMH, with input from the Principal Investigator (PI) of the overall research network and the PIs of the network sites. NIMH anticipates that any compounds that are evaluated in these networks will already have an Investigational New Drug (IND) approval/clearance from the FDA in order to avoid unanticipated delays in testing.</p>
<p>For purposes of this initiative, Phase I generally is used to refer to proof of mechanism or proof of principle - i.e., a demonstration that a targeted mechanism can be engaged in humans with some appropriate measures of physiological effect along with no adverse events/off target activity. For example, it might be demonstrated that a compound has occupied a given receptor, or that it produced one or more physiological or biochemical downstream effects as predicted from preclinical studies (e.g., EEG changes, decrease in a metabolite in CSF, etc.) and that any unexpected mechanism- related side effects have not been observed. Proof of clinical mechanism is here equated to proof of concept - a demonstration of clinical efficacy at doses shown to engage the specified target, ideally with some intermediate physiological or biochemical readout or biomarker (Phase IIa).</p>
<p>NIMH is considering use of an Intellectual Property Option to Collaborator<br />Clause similar to the following:</p>
<p>NIMH may collaborate with an outside investigator who has proprietary rights to compounds and/or devices which may be assigned under this contract. This collaborator will be identified by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) at the time of assignment and in this case, the following option regarding Intellectual Property Rights will be applicable.<br />Contractor agrees to promptly notify the NIMH and "Collaborator" in writing of any inventions, discoveries or innovations made by the Contractor's principal investigator or any other employees or agents of the Contractor, whether patentable or not, which are conceived and/or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of this study using Collaborator's Study Agent or Device (hereinafter "Contractor Inventions").Contractor agrees to grant to Collaborator: (1) a paid-up nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free, world-wide license to all Contractor Inventions for research purposes only; and (2) a time-limited first option to negotiate an exclusive world-wide royalty-bearing license for all commercial purposes, including the right to grant sub-licenses, to all Contractor Inventions on terms to be negotiated in good faith by Collaborator and Contractor. Collaborator shall notify Contractor, in writing, of its interest in obtaining an exclusive license to any Contractor Invention within six (6) months of Collaborator's receipt of notice of such Contractor Invention(s). In the event that Collaborator fails to so notify Contractor or elects not to obtain an exclusive license, then Collaborator's option shall expire with respect to that Contractor Invention, and Contractor will be free to dispose of its interests in such Contractor Invention in accordance with its own policies. If Contractor and Collaborator fail to reach agreement within ninety (90) days, (or such additional period as Collaborator and Contractor may agree) on the terms for an exclusive license for a particular Contractor Invention, then for a period of six (6) months thereafter, Contractor shall not offer to license the Contractor Invention to any third party on materially better terms than those last offered to Collaborator without first offering such terms to Collaborator, in which case Collaborator shall have a period of thirty (30) days in which to accept or reject the offer. Contractor agrees that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any inventions, discoveries or innovations, whether patentable or not, which are not Subject Inventions as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(e),* arising out of any unauthorized use of the Collaborator's Study Agent and/or Device shall be the property of the Collaborator (hereinafter "Collaborator Inventions"). Contractor will promptly notify the Collaborator in writing of any such Collaborator Inventions and, at Collaborator's request and expense, Contractor will cause to be assigned to Collaborator all right, title and interest in an to any such Collaborator Inventions and provide Collaborator with reasonable assistance to obtain patents (including causing the execution of any invention assignment or other documents). Contractor may also be conducting other more basic research using Study Agent and/or Device under the authority of a separate Material Transfer Agreement (MTA), or other such agreement with the Collaborator. Inventions arising there under shall be subject to the terms of the MTA, and not to this clause.*35 U.S.C. 201(e): The term "subject invention" means any invention of the Contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement: Provided, that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) (FOOTNOTE 1) of the Plant Variety Protection Act (7U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the period of contract performance. <br />Protection of Proprietary Data. <br />Data generated using an investigational agent and/or Device proprietary to a Collaborator will be kept confidential and shared only with the NIMH and the Collaborator. The Contractor retains the right to publish research results subject to the terms of this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sought.</strong></p>
<p>Comments about any aspects of this initiative are encouraged. These include the composition of these research networks, their capabilities, and the types of trials that are conducted. Examples of the kinds of comments that might be submitted under this RFI include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; What capabilities with respect to clinical targets are particularly valuable for the sites within research networks (e.g., PET, sMRI, fRMI, EEG/ERP, MEG, neurocognitive testing, emotion reactivity or regulation tasks)?</p>
<p>&bull; Are there particular RDoC constructs (see http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-funding/rdoc/index.shtml ) that appear particularly promising for new compound development with respect to one or another of the three study areas of autism spectrum disorders, psychotic spectrum disorders, and mood/anxiety spectrum disorders?</p>
<p>&bull; What targets (molecular and/or clinical) appear particularly promising for evaluation with respect to one or more of the three study areas of autism spectrum disorders, psychotic spectrum disorders, and mood/anxiety spectrum disorders? (Please specify the area)</p>
<p>&bull; Is it worth giving consideration to a broader or narrower range of trials than the Phase I to Phase IIa space that has been specified? For example, would it be useful to include research conducted before the IND phase in network evaluation (e.g., studies done under the aegis of the Exploratory IND); in what circumstances might this be useful?</p>

<SUBJECT>A--Technical Assistance Services for Communities (TASC)
<SOLNBR>SOL-HQ-12-00004
<CONTACT>Nicole Pratt
<DESC>PurposeThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research and gather information from industry on technical assistance to community members to facilitate their involvement in the environmental decisions affecting their community.  The purpose of this contract is to be able to provide supplemental, non-advocacy technical assistance services at no cost to communities to empower them to substantively participate in addressing environmental issues and actions which impact their community.This RFI is solely for informational, planning and market research purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor do they affect a potential offeror?s ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation.  The U.S. Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice.  Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to this process.  All data gathered shall remain the property of EPA.  All cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.BackgroundFor the last twenty-five years, the Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI, more commonly known as Superfund) has supported independent, non-advocacy, technical assistance programs that augment the technical assistance provided to communities by EPA staff.  Such assistance has been provided through Technical Assistance Grants (TAGs), the Technical Assistance Services for Communities (TASC) contract and, formerly, the Technical Outreach Services for Communities (TOSC) program that was administered through the Hazardous Substance Research Centers.  TAGs, while statutorily mandated, are limited to communities affected by National Priorities List (NPL) sites.  Therefore, TASC and its predecessor, TOSC, were developed to provide similar assistance to communities near hazardous waste sites ineligible for TAGs.   While support under the TAG program remains narrowly confined to the communities at NPL sites, the TASC program has expanded to encompass NPL and  non-NPL sites under the Superfund program, and  other  EPA offices and programs, such as Federal Facilities Restoration and Reuse Office (FFRRO), Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) (which manages the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  (RCRA) program), Office of Water (OW), Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ), and the Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) program.  The areas of technical assistance potentially sought under this requirement are as follows. (Please refer to the attached draft Statement of Work for a detailed description of the requirements for each task area.) ?	Technical Assistance Needs Assessment?	Community Advisory Group/Panel Formation?	Meeting Facilitation?	Technical Document Review and Interpretation?	Presentations?	Training?	Workshop Organizing and Delivery?	Community Educational Materials?	Communication Materials, and Program Analysis and Support?	Project Reports?	Community-Based Environmental Job-Training ProgramsQuestions for IndustryAs part of our market research and acquisition planning efforts, EPA requests firms with expertise and experience related to the requirements outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) provide feedback pertaining to the following questions:       1. Please indicate your small business socioeconomic classification if you are a small business firm.    2. As written, are the requirements outlined in the attached draft SOW clear and understandable? If not, what specific areas require additional clarity and in what way?3.  Please provide any information that needs to be considered from an acquisition planning perspective, to include actual or potential challenges/limitations associated with procuring these types of services (i.e. legal prohibitions, conflict of interest concerns, etc.)?4.  What labor categories and qualification requirements are most commonly associated with performing the task areas identified in the draft SOW? The Government is seeking feedback related to what firms practicing in this industry would view to be both the key and non-key labor positions and the minimum qualifications (i.e. education, years of experience, special certifications, etc.) for doing this type of work. 5.   Please discuss standard industry practices, and highlight any best practices associated with performing this type of work. 6.  Please discuss any issues the Contracting Officer should consider when developing the solicitation for this requirement (i.e. contract clauses, small business consideration, proposal preparation costs, etc.). Highlight any factors that would make competing for this contract desirable or undesirable for your firm. 7.   Please discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with a single award and/or a multiple award contract for these types of technical assistance services. What do you consider the more desirable option and why?  8.  Based on your firm?s experience, what procurement strategy represents the most effective approach when considering the cost, time, and resources required to manage a contact for these types of services efficiently.9.  What is the ideal contract type for procuring the type services supported under this requirement? Please discuss alternate contracting mechanisms to include Agency-specific contracts, Federal Supply Schedules, etc. 10.   Please discuss any additional comments or concerns.

INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Transparent Occlusive Dressings. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center., Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is May 2012. </strong>The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection.<br /></span>Points of Contact: <br />Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil, 808-433-3686 and <br />Wendy Sprouse, MMESO Pacific Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse@amedd.army.mil, 808-433-7985<br /></strong><br />B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Transparent Occlusive Dressings. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $927,007.63. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, fifty-one (51) of the total fifty-one (51) line items represent the top two (2) product groups and account for 100% ($927,007.63) of the total volume in sales $927,007.63 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil. </strong>The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong></span></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The five (5) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /></span></strong>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Transparent Occlusive Dressings for use on IV sites, that are sterile, individually wrapped, latex-free/safe, hypoallergenic, waterproof or water-resistant, moisture vapor permeable (porous enough to allow excess moisture vapor to vent but too small for bacteria and water to pass through), available in two size ranges as stated below, with a transparent window that allows visualization of the site.<br />a. At a minimum the vendor must provide Transparent Occlusive Dressings in sizes: small = approximately 1 1/2"x 1 1/2" to approximately 2 3/4"x 4"; and large = approximately 3"x 3" to approximately 3 3/4"x 5"<br /><br />REQUIRED ITEMS<br />1) Dressings transparent occlusive (IV) in size small with measurements ranging from approximately 1 1/2"x 1 1/2" to approximately 2 3/4"x 4"<br />2)Dressings transparent occlusive (IV) in size large with measurements ranging from approximately 3"x 3" to approximately 3 3/4"x 5"<br />&nbsp;<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Transparent Occlusive Dressings. <br />b. Vendor must provide a complete itemized list of products supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via Microsoft Excel spread sheet, and a product catalog and literature in response to this RFIAQ. Vendors are required to supply all items in all sizes and styles.<br />2. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Transparent Occlusive Dressings. Vendor must provide the DAPA number or provide documentation the DAPA number has been applied for. <br />3. Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Transparent Occlusive Dressings, or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />4. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />5. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act.<br />Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System.<br /><br />Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />1. Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Pacific, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO Pacific verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box of Transparent Occlusive Dressings, from each of the two size ranges indicated below, is to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites identified in the letters of invitation.<br />SAMPLE SET<br />1)Dressings transparent occlusive (IV) small size ranging from approximately 1 1/2"x 1 1/2" to approximately 2 3/4"x 4"<br />2)Dressings transparent occlusive (IV) large size ranging from approximately 3"x 3" to approximately 3 3/4"x 5"</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate sample products from each vendor&nbsp;against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, against the requirements and recording on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately seven (7) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. Efficiency of Use/Patient Safety/FDA Standard for Device Labeling - 21 CFR 820.120 - The packaging is easily identifiable as to size and type of product. Product packaging will be clearly and boldly labeled with the product type and size in order to avoid errors and waste.<br />2. Standard: IC.02.02.01: The hospital reduces the risk of infections associated with medical equipment, devices, and supplies. Product packaging is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to a sterile field. Product packaging must be easy to open and allow for aseptic delivery to a sterile field as compromising the sterile field could lead to patient infection.<br />3. Patient Comfort/Clinical effectiveness/Cost - The care of wounds; a guide for nurses, 3rd ed. - Design of dressing allows for easy application and product readily molds to a variety of anatomical shapes. This type of dressing is used on many different areas of the body, including those that curve, roll, fold, and have hair (i.e., subclavian &amp; forearm). Patient comfort and clinical effectiveness are of primary importance with any dressing product. Having to replace them frequently because they do not stay in place is very costly.<br />4. Patient Safety/Prevention of Infection - NPSG 07.04.01: Implement evidence-based practices to prevent central line -associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) - Dressing adheres securely to patient's skin, while removal of product does not damage skin. Impaired skin integrity increases patient's risk of infection.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Pacific and must be received by 5:00PM HST thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span></p>

<p>CCR REQUIREMENT - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (1) of that provision are as follows:</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical capability of the items offered to meet the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>2. Service support furnished with the offered system.</p>
<p>3. Price.</p>
<p>The government will award the purchase order to the lowest price technically acceptable quote.<br /><br />Technical acceptability will be determined by review of information submitted by the quoter who must provide sufficient descriptive literature that unequivocally demonstrates that offered products meet the technical requirements as stated herein.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the service meets the technical requirements.

The following addenda have been added by reference: 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000): "...not later than 1 day prior to contract expiration provided...preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30-days before the contract expires...this shall not exceed 4-years exclusive of the terms set forth for delivery and warranty".</p>
<p>The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

<p>At such time as the services of the Contractor are terminated, expire contractually or are otherwise not extended, or upon request by the Contracting Officer at any time, the Contractor shall issue, within five (5) working days, a "Certificate of Maintainability" for any or all equipment acquired and/or maintained under this contract. The certificate shall state that preventive maintenance in accordance with the specifications of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has been performed and that the equipment is performing in accordance with the OEM's specifications such that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any one-time charges (including but not limited to repair or inspection charges) if such maintenance were assumed effective the day after the Contractor's performance ceases. The Contractor is responsible for bearing all costs associated with obtaining such certification at no separate charge to the Government. Should the Contractor fail to issue the required Certificate of Maintainability in accordance with this clause, or should any equipment fail to perform in accordance with the certification, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any reasonable costs incurred by the Government for the purpose of bringing the equipment up to the required OEM maintenance level. If equipment is acquired under this contract, without maintenance of such equipment being concurrently acquired under the contract, the Contractor shall issue a Certificate of Maintainability for such equipment at the time of delivery for each piece of equipment. The certificate shall state that the equipment is in such condition that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any charges to the Government. All charges required to obtain the requisite performance of the equipment, up to the later of the time the equipment is accepted by the Government or the warranty expires, shall be borne by the Contractor. The time the equipment is accepted by the Government is the date that the Government determines that the equipment has passed acceptance testing, not the effective date of acceptance. The fact that the equipment may have been acquired with a warranty does not relieve the Contractor of its obligations under this clause.</p>
<p>Clauses and provisions are incorporated by reference and apply to this acquisition. Clauses and provisions can be obtained at http://www.arnet.gov.</p>
<p>A standard commercial warranty on parts and workmanship is required.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. The requirement will be issued by Department of Veteran Affairs, Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina (VAMC Durham).   

This combined synopsis/solicitation serves as a request for quote (RFQ) for lab services. The solicitation document, incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-54.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 621511.    


SCHEDULE OF SERVICES:

CLIN 0001	Genomic Testing		163		$__________	$___________

CLIN 0002	Storage				136		$__________	$___________

	

					Total			$__________	$___________

1.0	SCOPE OF WORK

CLIN 0001: The vendor shall provide all necessary services and materials to supply extraction, genotype testing, and storage up to 3 years for approximately 163 samples

CLIN 0002: Extraction and storage for up to 3 years for approximately 136 samples. 

VA Durham will provide to the vendor a lavender-topped EDTA tube drawn, containing a minimum of 1mL of whole blood for each patient.  

No patient information is required for genetic testing. Samples will not contain any identifiers that will enable patient identification. Each sample will be labeled with a randomly assigned study number; only the VAMC study staff will have access to the key linking patient identifiers to the study number. Upon arrival at the laboratory, a test development number (TD#) will be assigned to each sample, enabling the tracking of each sample through the DNA extraction, and testing processes within the laboratory. The test development and the VA study numbers will be linked throughout the study.  

As testing is completed, a "Research Only" report will be written for each sample.  The genotypic findings for the specified SNPS within the KCNJ11, PPARG and TCF7L2 genes will be denoted for each sample.  


2.0	PERFORMANCE DETAILS

DNA will be extracted from patient samples (EDTA anti-coagulated peripheral blood), and genetic testing will be performed for intervention participants on three genes related to diabetes (KNCJ11, PPARG, and TCF7L2).  Each gene contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of interest that will be genotyped to determine the alleles present.  

Through the use of an allelic discrimination assay, the genotype for specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in three genes related to diabetes (KNCJ11, PPARG, and TCF7L2) can be determined.  Each sample will have DNA extracted using a magnetic bead based automated technique, producing 100uL of purified DNA.  The DNA from participants randomized to the intervention group will then undergo genotyping for the desired SNPs in the specified diabetic related genes (KCNJ11, PPARG and TCF7L2). 

Any extracted DNA not used for testing will be stored until the completion of the study. Testing of study samples will be done using the allelic discrimination assay. Testing will be batched once a week, with a maximum turnaround time of 10 business days. 

SNPs to be genotyped in each gene:

KCNJ11:Rs5219
PPARG: Rs1801282
TCF7L2: Rs7903146

2.1. PERFORMANCE PERIOD

The performance period is estimated to be a twelve (12) month period.  

2.2 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE

Confined And Poorly Ventilated Enclosed Space Watch shall include an individual stationed outside one or more confined and poorly ventilated enclosed spaces who monitors authorized Entrants and is trained to perform all Confined And Poorly Ventilated Enclosed Space Watch duties.
Confined And Poorly Ventilated Enclosed Space Watch shall:
       a. Satisfactorily recognize a Confined and Poorly Ventilated enclosed Space and be knowledgeable of the hazards associated with working in these spaces.

 Communication will be at a minimum every 5 minutes for confined spaces and 1 hour for poorly ventilated enclosed spaces. Cell phones are not an acceptable form of communication. At the end of the shift, turn in log sheets to the Entry Supervisor.
       e. Remain outside the space during entry operations unless relieved by another authorized Confined And Poorly Ventilated Enclosed Space Watch.

Note: We expect candidates to be trained on the entire SOP with not just an understanding of their responsibilities but know the definitions, procedure and enclosures as it relates to the process.

Candidates should be able to recognize a valid Norfolk Naval Shipyard Confined Space Certificate (date posted, expiration date and time of expiration, Safe for Hot work, Safe for Entry and not safe for entry). They should know that entry into a confined or poorly ventilated enclosed space is not authorized without a posted Confined Space Certificate.
h. Bag and Drag/General Housecleaning and Spotter duties shall be assigned by the on-site supervisor to Confined and Poorly Ventilated Enclosed Space Watches that are released by the government Tank Area Manager (TAM) to be on standby.
  Government TAM will release Confined and Poorly Ventilated Enclosed Space Watch personnel to standby when tank watch duties are finished and the Confined and Poorly Ventilated Enclosed Space Watch is not needed for another Confined and Poorly Ventilated Enclosed Space Watch location. The standby status goes into effect one half hour after tank watch duties are completed. Bag and Drag/General Housecleaning duties are the removal of industrial debris such as sheet metal, steel plate, structured shapes, piping, cable ends, nuts and bolts, spent welding wire, hardware and/or trash from overhead to deck.  Spotter duties are coordinating pedestrian traffic with vehicular traffic to maintain pedestrian safety, typically performed at the head or foot of the ships ramp.
 
i. Government reserves the right to make changes to the contract as new requirements dictate.
j. Government requires potential contractor candidates to provide specific training lesson plans for confined space for review prior to awarding contract.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman.

If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

For this solicitation, United States Marine Corps Regional Contracting Office, National Capitol Region intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc.; therefore, vendors should not use the Submit Bid button on the NECO website to submit their pricing information.

United States Marine Corps Regional Contracting Office, National Capitol Region is taking this action in an effort to improve both vendor access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, competed, real-time bids. All responsible vendors that respond to this combined synopsis/solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.
 Vendors who require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Vendors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the FedBid process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive process.

It is the responsibility of the vendor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR), vendors must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award.

<DESC>16 DECEMBER 2011
<p>There have been a few questions asked on this solicitation and the questions along with the responses are listed below. There is also a revised purchase description, 12M-204A-PR, Revision 1 dated 14 December 2011 that has been posted along with an Instructions to Offerors. The due date for proposals has also been extended to 22 December 2011, 4 PM EST.</p>
<p>Question: It appears that there is a possible semantics conflict. The opportunity and associated PD calls for barometer. By definition, a barometer measures atmospheric pressures. The PD states that the proposed solution measure from 0.5 psia to 16 psia. 0.5 psia is well below the minimum barometric pressure that is found anywhere on earth. Typically in barometric applications, the minimum pressure is about 11 psia. Is the requirement really to measure pressures as low as 0.5 psia?</p>
<p><br />Response: Most of the time, these gauges will be used to measure barometric pressure. However, I stated I wanted a range down to 0.5psia because they will also be<br />used below atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p><br />Question: Section 2.2 of the PD indicates a measurement uncertainty specification that does not include any time dependency. Most uncertainty statement of which I am aware do include a time dependency. Is it correct that the measurement uncertainty for this requirement should not include any time dependency (long term or short term stability)? This statement also makes reference to temperature compensation. Is the temperature compensation range assume to be equal to order wider than the 73 +/- 6 degrees F operating range specification defined in section 3.4?</p>
<p>Response: Time Dependency: It should hold this<br />accuracy for at least a year.<br />Temp Compensation: Yes it should be able to hold its accuracy with this<br />temp range.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to post the answers to questions 14, 15, 23, 26, and 52.</p>
<p><br />14. Would all internal testing be conducted from your network in Washington, DC?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes</p>
<p>15. Is there a pre-established budget for this project? Could you please provide the budget figure?</p>
<p>Answer: 15a. Yes. 15b. The budget information will not be revealed.</p>
<p>23. Where are the systems to be tested located? Are any of FHFA systems/applications within the scope of this effort hosted by third-party organizations? if so where?</p>
<p>Answer: 23a. The systems to be tested are located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. 23b. FHFA will not provide any information pertaining to operational security.</p>
<p><br />26. Could you please tell us if this is a first time contract or if a similar contract was awarded in past years as well? If yes, could you please provide us a copy of the proposal of the most recently successful contract holder or at least the bid amount that the successful bidder had presented the last time? I believe this will help us provide a much more complete response.</p>
<p>Answer: As indicated on the answer to question #3, this is a new requirement for the Federal Housing Finance Agency. One of the legacy agencies (Federal Housing Finance Board) had a contract with Brown &amp; Company for Federal Information Security Management Audit Services, where part of the scope was for similar efforts. A copy of the proposal or bid will not be provided.</p>
<p>52. Are any of the locations multitenant facilities? If so, how many?</p>
<p>Answer: 52a. Yes, all FHFA facilities are multi-tenant and we currently have four (4).</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<DESC>This Amendment makes the following changes to the Invitation for Bid (IFB) N6247312RP007:
1. Paragraph 3.b in the Invitation for Bid currently states the Bid Opening shall begin promptly at 2:00p.m.  Pacific Daylight Time (PDT), on December 20, 2011. The Bid Opening date has been amended to promptly take place at 2:00p.m. PDT, on January 10, 2012.
2.  Paragraph 11. Important Notices in the Invitation for Bid is amended by inserting the following: SEVENTEENTH IMPORTANT NOTICE  PROPOSED CALTRANS LICENSE. Paragraph 11 of the proposed Lease states, This LEASE is subject to all outstanding easements and rights of way over, across, in and upon the LEASED PROPERTY, or any portion thereof, and to the right of the GOVERNMENT to grant such additional easements and/or rights of way over, across, in and upon the LEASED PROPERTY as the GOVERNMENT shall determine to be in the public interest. Bidders are hereby notified that Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar may issue a proposed access License to the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) within the proposed MCAS Miramar Agricultural Outlease boundary.
 This license would authorize CALTRANS to utilize an existing access road through the leased premises to access to their existing right-of-way for the I-805 North Design Build Project located adjacent to the Outleased boundary. The term of the new license is proposed to begin 1 March 2012 and end 30 June 2016. This proposed license would require a working relationship and the coordination between the CALTRANS and the Lessee. As a provision of the proposed license, CALTRANS would be required to obtain written approval from the Lessee to ensure that the proposed access does not interfere with nursery operations.  The Temporary Access Agreement Map for the proposed access license is attached for your reference as Attachment #4 to the IFB.
3.
 Attachment #3 of the IFB, Department of the Navy Lease for Agricultural Purposes is amended by deleting Exhibit B, MCAS Miramar Agricultural Outlease Map, therefrom and inserting the attached Exhibit B, MCAS Miramar Agricultural Outlease Map, thereto.
4. The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred or associated with the preparation and submission of a proposal in response to this solicitation.
5. ALL OTHER PARAGRAPHS, PROVISIONS, AND CONDITIONS OF THE IFB ARE TO REMAIN UNCHANGED.
6. Bidders shall complete Blocks 8 and 15A, sign Block 15B, and submit this Amendment in a sealed bid envelope with the Bid and Bid Deposit. Block 11 requires that the potential bidders acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to the hour and date specified, as amended.
 Failure of your acknowledgement to be received at the place designated for the receipt of offers prior to the hour and date specified may result in rejection of your bid.

It is likely that this or another classified deployment will be a requirement of the follow-on contractor. The&nbsp;contractor must have, at day one of contract award, the ability to receive classified deployment information, prepare to negotiate the requirement, and get to the deployed location within the 120 day phase-in timeframe.</span></p>
<p>In regards to Facility Clearances (FCLs), Chapter 2-102 of the NISPOM establishes eligibility requirements a company must meet before it can be processed for an FCL. One requirement is that there has to be a need to access classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. Government requirement. In the case of the C-21 requirement, access to classified information is not required for a company to SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The Government is not in a position to remove the requirement to obtain an FCL prior to award because a contractor must have a FCL the day of award in order to carry out the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Even though there is a requirement to have a FCL prior to award, the Government cannot sponsor any contractors until there is a bona fide need for that contractor to access classified information for this C-21 CLS requirement. Take caution that if another contractor sponsors a company for an FCL for this C-21 effort, there are no guaranteed assurances that DSS will approve the FCL. Defense Security Services (agency responsible to the issuance of FCLs) have informed this agency that the FCL depends on a variety of circumstances such as completion of all FCL required paperwork, the identification of the company Key Management Personnel (KMP) who must obtain personnel clearances to the level of the FCL (if the KMP are uncleared this can take some time), FOCI mitigation, etc.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Questions and Answers<br /></span><span>Additional Questions and Answers are attached to this posting.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE (1 Dec 11)<br /></strong></span><br />Due to a change in policies and procedures, the lead time to get Base Entry Approval has shortened. For those Contractors who <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will not be</strong></span> traveling with someone who already has base access, please get the information requested in the Pre-Proposal Conference Announcement Packet (Guest Name, Drivers License #, State of Issue, and Date of Birth) to Samuel McDuffey, <a href="mailto:Samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil">samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil</a>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO LATER THAN FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2011</strong></span>.

<p>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation<br />Paying Agent (PA) Services Synopsis</p>
<p>PBGC disburses about 800,000 benefit payments each month totaling above $5 billion annually to retirees in over 4,000 terminated private-sector single-employer defined benefit pension plans. PBGC is seeking the most cost-effective Paying Agent (PA) solution that the market has to offer subject to identified PBGC constraints (e.g. organizational structure, risk profile, system limitations, file formats, business processes). PA services are overseen by the Benefits Payment Branch (BPB) of the Retiree Services Division (RSD) within the Benefits Administration and Payments Department (BAPD). PBGC maintains its own pension recordkeeping system for over 1.5 million participants. That system packages payment changes (adds and updates) and transmits them to the PA's pension payment system several times each month.<br /><br />Services sought include the following (activities flagged with * indicate an opportunity for departure, or potential departure from historical practices, bracketed numbers indicate fiscal year (Oct-Sept) 2011 volumes:<br /><br />&bull; Perform all services in observable compliance with: <br />o The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), associated National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (e.g. 800-37, 800-60, 800-53, 800-53A, 800-137, 800-34 and other applicable NIST standards), and evolving PBGC Enterprise Information Security Office (EISO) policies and procedures including Information Security Requirements for Externally Hosted Systems. Safeguarding sensitive PBGC data (protecting its availability, confidentiality and integrity in accordance with FIPS 199/200 requirements), access controls, configuration management, contingency planning (including continuity of operations) and a rigorous continuous monitoring plan are of especially critical importance. Most of PBGC data, including data loaded into the PA's pension payment system, requires NIST 800-53 controls required of moderate risk systems. The required high-level process is as follows. It is expected that after contract award, items 1 - 6 will be completed before the PA's pension payment system can go live with PBGC data:<br />1. Define the control environment of the PA's pension payment system<br />2. Assess the adequacy of the control environment against NIST 800-53 controls<br />3. Document the gaps<br />4. Develop plan of actions and milestones (POA&amp;M) to close the gaps<br />5. Evaluate the risks of operating the system based on items 1 - 4<br />6. Decide to authorize the operation of the PA's pension payment system (or not) - A Federal Responsibility<br />7. Monitor the progress of the POA&amp;M<br />8. Continually evaluate the effectiveness of the control environment. The failure to obtain and maintain a valid system security authorization will be grounds for termination of the contract.<br />o A sound system of internal controls as evidenced by, among other things, annual SSAE No. 16 (formerly SAS 70) covering internal control over all operations associated with PBGC benefit payments including any services performed by sub-service organizations (e.g. subcontractors/joint ventures for outsourced IT, print/mail, tax, check image services).<br /><br />&bull; Support PBGC audits including those sponsored by PBGC's Inspector General (see for example the report on internal controls at http://oig.pbgc.gov) [In FY11 this included 8 full days at contractor sites]. <br /><br />&bull; Disburse benefit payments to PBGC payees via EFT PPD [7 million] &amp; IAT* [0] entries and paper checks [2 million]. Payments include:<br />o Monthly annuities [9 million], back payments [32,000]. and other payments payable on the first of the month;<br />o Lump sum distributions [13,000] and other payments *weekly [2,200].<br />o Unique-situation payments [1,600 Fleming, 57 Page-Collins settlement, 0 Rettig/SID settlement (last was 12/2009) payments]<br /><br />&bull; Calculate, withhold, remit to IRS &amp; report to IRS &amp; to PBGC payees federal income taxes (not state income taxes)<br /><br />&bull; Withhold and remit PBGC-approved IRS levies and a limited number of medical/life deductions to support unique agreements (~4,000 payees in several steel plans).<br /><br />&bull; Maintain PBGC sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII), on contractor-owned pension payment system hosted within the United States and accessible only to authorized employees from within the United States.<br /><br />&bull; Continue recurring payments until PBGC transmits a change (recurring payments are mostly monthly but some quarterly, semi-annual and annual).<br /><br />&bull; Provide read-only web access to about 500 PBGC users and limited read-write access to about 10* PBGC/BPB users to the contractor's pension payment system.<br /><br />&bull; Exchange data between PBGC's benefit administration systems, including:<br />o approved payment changes from PBGC [450,000];<br />o acknowledgement of approved changes from contractor;<br />o trial balance projection from contractor;<br />o payment history (payee sub-ledgers) from contractor;<br />o NOC &amp; ACH return files from contractor;<br />o potentially tax forms (e.g. 1099-R) &amp; check images from contractor for PBGC's Image Processing System (IPS)*;<br />o potentially daily individual payee settlement data (e.g. checks that have cleared) from contractor*.<br /><br />&bull; Provide a web service for PBGC's MyPBA online self-service system (www.pbgc.gov/mypba) to serve payment history data (payee sub-ledgers) and images of checks and tax forms (e.g. 1099-R, 1042-S) to PBGC payees.<br /><br />&bull; Provide exception processing services including:<br />o delete pending ACH payments prior to submission to the ACH Operator [5,100];<br />o stop payment on checks [16,000];<br />o reissue stopped checks to permanent address [9,300];<br />o reissue stopped checks to temporary address [2,300];<br />o express mail reissued checks [340]<br />o issue manual checks in rare situations [30]<br />o process ACH returns [6,600];<br />o issue replacement checks for ACH returns [5,200];<br />o resolve returned replacement checks for ACH returns [470];<br />o return funds to PBGC for stopped or returned payments not reissued [6,800];<br />o return funds to PBGC for stale-dated checks [4,800];<br />o issue replacement checks for stale-dated checks upon PBGC request<br />o process approved manual changes and enter data into the PA's pension payment system [400];<br />o potentially process ACH pre-notification entries* [0];<br />o process ACH notices of change (NOC) [8,400];<br />o process ACH reclamations [8,500], recoveries* [0], and written demands to RDFIs for payment [500];<br />o process ACH traces [1,100];<br />o provide copies of paid checks not available to PBGC via contractor's pension payment system [800]<br />o process payment history (payee sub-ledger) adjustments;<br />o recover (or net) tax overpayments from the IRS;<br />o disburse overpayment refunds to PBGC payees [200];<br />o investigate potential fraud.<br /><br />&bull; Support written and oral communications with or involving payees including:<br />o mail checks with custom PBGC messages and occasional inserts (e.g. EFT marketing brochure, newsletter);<br />o mail statements to payees (e.g. net change, trustee to trustee transfer, net zero) [190,000];<br />o use PBGC's Document Management Center's (DMC) address as the return address on all outgoing written communications to PBGC payees*;<br />o forward incoming mail from individual PBGC payees to PBGC's DMC* [In FY11 PA processed (scan/index) 15,000 mail pieces, but at that time outgoing mail bore the PA's return address];<br />o direct calls from individual PBGC payees to PBGC's Customer Contact Center (CCC)* [In FY11 PA handled about 400 calls directly (not forwarded), but incoming calls will dwindle with PBGC return address on checks];<br />o forward subpoenas. and IRS tax levies to PBGC's Office of General Counsel for processing;<br />o potentially* mail non-resident alien (NRA) letters and letters associated with IRS levies to PBGC payees.<br /><br />&bull; Use certain PBGC systems for:<br />o communication (Email, Web Portal);<br />o exception processing (eCARF Portal);<br />o research (e.g. Spectrum, CRM, IPS);<br />o letter generation (eALG);<br />o performance and other reporting (Paying Agent Acquisition Support Metrics - PAASM Portal).<br /><br />&bull;

Background. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The Department of the Air Force is responsible for organizing, training, equipping, and providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required to enable the conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces.
<p>2. Description.</p>
<p>A. Submissions under ATI BAA with Supplemental Information. This announcement requests submissions under BAA HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA for the basic and applied research associated with an Airborne Weapon Layer (AWL) for the BMDS. MDA and the US Air Force (USAF) request submissions from industry in the areas of (1) airborne sensors, (2) air-launched kinetic interceptors, and/or (3) integrated sensor and interceptor approaches. The sensors, interceptors, and/or integrated approaches will result in end-to-end kill chains on existing or planned USAF combat aircraft, US Navy (USN) combat aircraft, or other innovative platforms. MDA and the Air Force are investigating an AWL that emphasizes engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory (boost and early ascent phases) while also providing capabilities for descent and terminal phase engagements. MDA and the Air Force request performance, cost, and schedule information on an AWL that can support a proof of principle flight demonstration within 3 years in order to determine its relative utility. The demonstration will serve as proof of technological feasibility and provide an assessment of producibility.</p>
<p>B. Concept of Employment. The information below provides a brief overview of expected basing, desired operational employment, and potential involvement of partners. Additional information on the Concept of Employment will be provided at the Industry Days.</p>
<p>(1) AWL capability will be forward based to provide immediate response to emerging crises and potential conflict. AWL capability stationed in the United States will provide Homeland Defense and rapid theater augmentation.</p>
<p>(2) AWL may be integrated in both offensive counterair and defensive counterair operations. Offensive counterair using AWL would likely focus on integration within attack operations packages. Defensive counterair operations would likely focus on engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory, but would also include area defense and point defense of critical assets. Offensive counterair and defensive counterair capabilities are to be provided in the context of their associated operational altitudes and positions. For more information on counterair operations, refer to Joint Publication 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats, 5 Feb 07 found here: www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_01.pdf. <br /><br />(3) AWL will be tasked to quickly integrate with air and naval forces to gain operational advantage over the adversary.</p>
<p>(4) AWL may conduct operations using decentralized execution with engagement authority delegated to the individual fire unit (platform operator). Delegation would be consistent with the rules of engagement, defended asset lists, and platform position depending on other missions assigned and maneuvers for self-defense.</p>
<p>(5) AWL will also transmit and receive data including situational awareness, sensor cues, and fire control solutions with other air, space, land, and maritime air defense assets using normal communication/data link and air defense networks. Integrated fire control engagements may occur based on AWL formation tasking, or they may be directed by engagement authorities outside the formation.</p>
<p>(6) AWL should be considered for Allies and multi-national partners through international armament cooperation.</p>
<p>C. Major AWL Components. Respondents should consider:</p>
<p>(1) Platform. Potential platform options include current or future fighters, bombers, or remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). For submission preparation purposes, respondents may use F-15C, F-35A, B-1B, MQ-9, and/or others as a baseline for their reply; however, innovative concepts using other platforms are encouraged.</p>
<p>(2) Sensors and Integrated Sensor Approaches. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should address the following functions: detect, track, target, and provide/support a valid fire control solution, state vector, and covariance at extended ranges from the ballistic missile launch site. Both organic and networked concepts will be considered. Sensor capability should support the full range of interceptor capabilities without degrading aircraft performance beyond that of current targeting pods on aircraft. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should also provide capabilities for engagements against multiple ballistic missiles, warheads, and/or reentry vehicles with capability for basic classification/typing and discrimination. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches may introduce new equipment, modify existing equipment, or integrate combinations of new, modified, and existing equipment to include radars, infrared search and track systems, targeting pods, etc. Modifications to existing equipment should not adversely affect primary mission functions of the platform.</p>
<p>(3) Interceptors. Interceptors should be compatible for carriage and employment across all speeds and G loadings for USAF fighters, bombers, and unmanned aircraft systems. Interceptors may be carried internally or externally on fighters, bombers, or RPVs. Interceptors for internal carriage should be sized and shaped to fit within an F-35A internal weapons bay without interfering with other internal weapons carriage and employment. Options that can be integrated on multiple platforms are desirable over single-platform concepts. Interceptors may also be compatible with carriage and employment from USN combat aircraft. Interceptors should be capable of engaging basic and complex ballistic missile threats. Interceptors may take an incremental development approach that provides an interim capability enroute to final capability. Final production interceptors should also meet insensitive munitions requirements. Interceptors should be compatible with carriage and employment from existing air-to-air and/or air-to-ground weapons stations on fighter, bomber, or RPV to the maximum extent practical. Unique equipment required for carriage and employment of interceptors shall be included in the interceptor reply.</p>
<p>(4) Communications. AWL platform will use current and/or planned platform-specific communications/data link capabilities to provide information to and receive information from other AWL assets or Missile and Air Defense Networks. This includes state vectors, covariance, and fire control quality data. Both organic and networked performance will be considered. Requirements for AWL communications capabilities beyond these parameters shall be included in responses.</p>
<p>(5) Integration. Respondents should address integration issues for sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications systems.</p>
<p>3. BAA Submissions with Supplemental Information.</p>
<p>A. Cost. Cost proposals should be prepared in accordance with the instructions as provided under the MDA ATI BAA, HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions.

<CONTACT>Wanda Carrier, Email carrier.wanda@epa.gov
<DESC><p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research and gather information from industry on technical assistance to community members to facilitate their involvement in the environmental decisions affecting their community. The purpose of this contract is to be able to provide supplemental, non-advocacy technical assistance services at no cost to communities to empower them to substantively participate in addressing environmental issues and actions which impact their community.</p>
<p>This RFI is solely for informational, planning and market research purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor do they affect a potential offeror?s ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation. The U.S. Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to this process. All data gathered shall remain the property of EPA. All cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>For the last twenty-five years, the Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI, more commonly known as Superfund) has supported independent, non-advocacy, technical assistance programs that augment the technical assistance provided to communities by EPA staff. Such assistance has been provided through Technical Assistance Grants (TAGs), the Technical Assistance Services for Communities (TASC) contract and, formerly, the Technical Outreach Services for Communities (TOSC) program that was administered through the Hazardous Substance Research Centers. TAGs, while statutorily mandated, are limited to communities affected by National Priorities List (NPL) sites. Therefore, TASC and its predecessor, TOSC, were developed to provide similar assistance to communities near hazardous waste sites ineligible for TAGs. While support under the TAG program remains narrowly confined to the communities at NPL sites, the TASC program has expanded to encompass NPL and non-NPL sites under the Superfund program, and other EPA offices and programs, such as Federal Facilities Restoration and Reuse Office (FFRRO), Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) (which manages the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) program), Office of Water (OW), Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ), and the Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) program.</p>
<p>The areas of technical assistance potentially sought under this requirement are as follows. (Please refer to the attached draft Statement of Work for a detailed description of the requirements for each task area.) ? Technical Assistance Needs Assessment? Community Advisory Group/Panel Formation? Meeting Facilitation? Technical Document Review and Interpretation? Presentations? Training? Workshop Organizing and Delivery? Community Educational Materials? Communication Materials, and Program Analysis and Support? Project Reports? Community-Based Environmental Job-Training Programs</p>
<p><strong>Questions for Industry</strong></p>
<p>As part of our market research and acquisition planning efforts, EPA requests firms with expertise and experience related to the requirements outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) provide feedback pertaining to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Please indicate your small business socioeconomic classification if you are a small business firm.</p>
<p>2. As written, are the requirements outlined in the attached draft SOW clear and understandable? If not, what specific areas require additional clarity and in what way?</p>
<p>3. Please provide any information that needs to be considered from an acquisition planning perspective, to include actual or potential challenges/limitations associated with procuring these types of services (i.e. legal prohibitions, conflict of interest concerns, etc.)?</p>
<p>4. What labor categories and qualification requirements are most commonly associated with performing the task areas identified in the draft SOW? The Government is seeking feedback related to what firms practicing in this industry would view to be both the key and non-key labor positions and the minimum qualifications (i.e. education, years of experience, special certifications, etc.) for doing this type of work.</p>
<p>5. Please discuss standard industry practices, and highlight any best practices associated with performing this type of work.</p>
<p>6. Please discuss any issues the Contracting Officer should consider when developing the solicitation for this requirement (i.e. contract clauses, small business consideration, proposal preparation costs, etc.). Highlight any factors that would make competing for this contract desirable or undesirable for your firm.</p>
<p>7. Please discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with a single award and/or a multiple award contract for these types of technical assistance services. What do you consider the more desirable option and why?</p>
<p>8. Based on your firm?s experience, what procurement strategy represents the most effective approach when considering the cost, time, and resources required to manage a contact for these types of services efficiently.</p>
<p>9. What is the ideal contract type for procuring the type services supported under this requirement? Please discuss alternate contracting mechanisms to include Agency-specific contracts, Federal Supply Schedules, etc.</p>
<p>10. Please discuss any additional comments or concerns.</p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

The due date for the Application package (to include the SF-330s) is changed from January 10, 2012 to January 5, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. EST. This is due to any error in the last Modification that moved it to January 10th. That Modification should have said January 5, 2012.

In addition, the fourth paragraph from the end of the presolicitation notice is changed as follows:
The last sentence is changed to read, "The final selection of highly qualified firms will be based on the combined total rating of the written SF330s and the oral presentation interview which the oral presentation is more important than the SF330."

<AWARDEE>Singhal and Company, Inc.
<DESC>Multiple centers within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require Audio Visual (AV) support services at both Government and non-Government facilities. The requirements range from a base year with multiple options to one-day meetings. Due to the FDA's fluctuating conference, training, and meeting needs, centers are unable to forecast all requirements for AV support services based on quantity and delivery schedule. Furthermore, the fluctuating needs may inhibit the centers' ability to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.
<p>For the reasons specified above,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;determined that an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with the ability to issue Firm-Fixed Price, Labor Hour, or Time and Material Task Orders and is in the best interest of the FDA.&nbsp;While non-fixed price task orders may be issued, The Government will issue Firm-Fixed Price Task Orders to the maximum extent practicable.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p><br />I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p><br />Acquisition Office: <br />30 CONS/LGCZ <br />Vandenberg AFB, CA</p>
<p>Contracting Office Location: <br />30 CONS/LGCZ <br />1515 Iceland Ave<br />Vandenberg AFB, CA 93437</p>
<p>Contracting Officer: Claudia D. Boga<br />DSN 275-2661, Commercial: (805) 605-2661</p>
<p>Purchase Request: <br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is an interim extension for twenty-four months to F0468-03-C-0050, the Western Range Operations, Communications and Information (WROCI) Contract. The WROCI contract has been designated as a "mission essential contract" under DoDI 3020.37.</p>
<p>The existing WROCI contract, a Cost Plus Incentive Fee/Award Fee (CPIF/CPAF) contract, provides for operations and maintenance, support services, training, command, control, communications, information and computer systems services, testing, modifying and installing communications, electronic and security systems at launch facilities, launch control centers and test facilities for the 30th Space Wing. The WROCI contract is a base plus 7 option year contract, which is currently in its seventh option year. The seventh (last) option year will end on 30 Sep 2011. This contract action with a period of performance of 1 October 2011 - 30 Sep 2013 is intended to provide continuation of mission essential support services while a much more comprehensive follow-on contract is finalized. The twenty-four month extension is structured as four (4) consecutive periods of performance: 1 Oct 11 through 31 Mar 12; 1 Apr 12 - 30 Sep 12; 1 Oct 12 through 31 Mar 13 and 1 Apr 13 - 30 Sep 13. This structure allows for the exercise of the first six-month extension (1 Oct 11 through 31 Mar 12) with ninety (90) days notice (as of 30 Jun 2011) under clause 52.217-8, contingent on approval of this J&amp;A, followed by the second six-month extension through 30 Sep 12. The third six-month extension (1 Oct 12 through 31 Mar 13) will accommodate the projected Launch and Test Range (LTRS) Integrated Support Contract (LISC) award date of 28 Sep 12 with a three-month phase in through Dec 12. As events in the LISC acquisition timeline unfold, and if it becomes apparent that further extensions will be necessary, the fourth extension can be exercised <br />independently or at the same time as the third six-month period, whichever is appropriate. The third extension can be exercised independently if developments in the LISC acquisition indicate that the fourth extension will not be necessary. Conversely, the fourth extension period can be exercised at the same time as the third extension if events in the LISC acquisition timeline indicate that the LISC will not be awarded on schedule.</p>
<p>Options for a period of time smaller than six months is not feasible due to the administrative burden of additional requests for proposal and proposal preparation on the part of the contractor. Additionally, issuance and re-issuance of contractor employee Common Access Cards (CAC) numbering in excess of 700 for periods less than six months would be an unnecessary burden for both the Government and the contractor. Both of these scenarios could potentially cause a negative impact on critical support required for launches projected during this timeframe. The follow-on contract, LISC, will combine three separate and distinct contracts and provide for future modernization of the ranges to include the WROCI. The three contracts to be combined are 1): The Western Range Operations, Communications and Information (WROCI) contract, which supports Western Range operations, level-one maintenance and base operations support, and is managed by the 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg AFB, CA; 2) The Eastern Range Technical Services (ERTS) contract, which supports Eastern Range operations, level-one maintenance and base operations support and is managed by the 45th Space Wing, Patrick AFB, FL; and 3) The Space Lift Range Systems (SLRS) contract, which Provides sustainment through level-two depot maintenance, logistics support and range modernization/upgrades and is managed by the Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles AFB, CA. <br /><br />The WROCI contractor currently provides support to the Spacelift Ranges in conjunction with the ERTS and SLRS. The follow-on contract, LISC, which combines the WROCI, ERTS and SLRS contracts, was originally anticipated to be awarded by SMC as early as August 2011. However, due to the increased complexity and scope of the combined requirement, award of the LISC is now anticipated not to occur until on or about 28 Sep 12. LISC is expected to have a three-month phase-in period (through 28 Dec 2012), 15 months after the expiration date of the current WROCI contract (30 Sep 11). The three-month phase-in period does not allow for potential protests from contractors and does not take into consideration the fluctuating and possibly heavy launch tempo that is likely to occur. Requesting an extension period that reaches beyond Dec 2012 (through Sep 2013) is prudent and will allow for critical contract support during these or other unpredictable events. Advance planning for the follow-on contract (LISC) began in early 2009 with the formation of the requirements team. Development of the requirements and Acquisition Plan for the follow-on contract has required substantially more time and resources than anticipated. This was attributable in large part to the substantial increase in complexity and scope of the requirements. Additionally, unanticipated delays in the process have put the Government in the position of not having a WROCI contract awarded prior to the expiration of the current WROCI contract (30 Sep 11). 30 CONS has no direct role in the LISC acquisition, other than as advisors to SMC relating to operation of the current WROCI contract.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY NEEDS</p>
<p>The WROCI contract requirements include providing Western Range operations and maintenance; support services; training; command, control, communications, information and computer systems services; testing, modifying and installing communications, electronic and security systems at launch facilities, launch control centers test facilities and all appropriate 14 AF alarmed facilities. The WROCI provides network equipment and software maintenance, and direct customer support for user access to, and information transfer, over the Non-Classified internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), Local Area Network (LAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN) to the US Air Force, 30th Space Wing (30 SW). The WROCI requires an innovative, integrated, flexible and effective management approach and the contractor must provide technical support in a planned and coordinated manner which will ensure essential Western Range support systems are ready to support user requirements, and cause no impact to Range program schedules due to equipment degradation, failures, system problems or reprioritization of program requirements. This contract is deemed "mission essential" pursuant to DoDI 3020.37. InDyne, Inc. is the incumbent contractor under the current WROCI contract. <br />The government intends to negotiate basic CLINs for Management, Operations, Logistics, Reimbursables, Travel, Operation Support to Acquisition (OSTA)/Mission Flight Control Center (MFCC) Support, Overtime, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Support, O&amp;M LCG Comm Support, X-37B Contingency Support and Target Motion Resolution Analysis to ensure the continuation of these vital services for the twenty-four month extension period of performance proposed herein. The estimated cost of these services for the proposed twenty-four month extension is $116,964,443.61.<br />This estimate is based on the IGE dated 12 Apr 11. Funding for this effort will utilize 3400 appropriations. <br /><br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this action is contracting by Other than Full and Open Competition, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), this effort is only available from the original source because it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The current WROCI Contractor, InDyne, Inc. is the only responsible source that can fulfill all of the WROCI contract requirements within the current schedule and budget constraints. The learning curve of a new contractor would have a negative impact on the range's ability to meet launch schedules and would increase the risk of launch delays. InDyne, Inc. possesses established processes and procedures necessary to accomplish the operations, communications and information requirements of this contract. <br />To award an interim contract to any source other than InDyne, Inc. would cause unacceptable risk of mission delays and could prevent critical space launches from being achieved. Given the complexity and scope of WROCI requirements, award of an interim range contract based on full and open competition would require at least 13-15 months from the date of posting a Request for Proposal (RFP). This would place the award date for the interim contract well past the current WROCI contract expiration date of 30 Sep 11. Additionally, the LISC follow-on contract, which includes WROCI requirements, is anticipated to be awarded by 28 Sep 2012, with a 3 month Phase-In through 28 Dec 2012.</p>
<p>The current contract (F04684-03-C-0050) was awarded competitively on 23 Jul 03 and expires 30 Sep 2011. The incumbent contractor, InDyne, Inc. is the only known contractor that is capable of providing all of the services described in Section III above within the time frame provided. The Government must have these critical and highly specialized services without delay or interruption of service in order to meet the mission. The WROCI contract supports a technically diverse, complex and dynamic environment directly related to the 30th SW launch mission. Without the contracting coverage provided by the WROCI contract, launch capabilities would be adversely affected, to include launch delays, which have been estimated to cost the Government up to $1M per day. Delays and/or slippages of these launches due to inadequate support could potentially cost the Government millions of dollars. <br />Due to the criticality of services provided by the WROCI contract and the impact that would result from the interruption of these services, the Vandenberg AFB mission would be seriously jeopardized unless the agency is permitted to extend the current contract for a period of twenty-four months.</p>
<p>Delays caused by a new contractor ramping up and transitioning into full performance could impair the integrity of launch schedules, jeopardize safety and security of government property, and may result in launch delays and degradation of mission readiness.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF THE EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>A Notice of Intent to issue a sole source extension in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for a performance period of twenty-four (24) months was publicized in FedBizOps on 24 Mar 11. No responses or expressions of interest were received from industry.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer anticipates the costs for this effort will be fair and reasonable. In accordance with FAR 15.403-4, the contractor will be required to provide certified cost and pricing data. The Contracting Officer will make a determination as to the cost fairness and reasonableness based on, but not limited to, the following recommendations: Audit Reports from DCAA, Program Office technical evaluations and extensive prior service contract history.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED <br /><br />Market research revealed that the services required to support the Western Range and the 30th Space Wing are unique relative to some of the requirements currently in operations such as launch capabilities and MDA requirements. In some instances, these services are not available in the commercial marketplace. The services performed under the WROCI are relied upon heavily by the Air Force to meet demanding and critical launch support requirements. Market research also showed that although contracts for Operations and Communications type services exist, none of the contractors have experience that encompasses the totality of the requirements of the WROCI contract to include all three major areas of Operations, Communications and Information contained in the WROCI contract. Market research included posting of a Special Notice titled "Notice of Intent to Extend Services for Western Range Operations. Communications and Information (WROCI)" to the Federal Business Opportunities website on 24 Mar 11, to include requesting businesses with an interest in performing the services advertised to contact VAFB, not later than 11 Apr 11. There were no responses of interest from industry.<br />Also, market research included EZ Query to determine if there is anything out there that encompasses the services offered on the WROCI. EZ Query did not identify services the same or similar to what is offered under the WROCI contract.<br /><br />IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The proposed extension would ensure continuation of mission essential services. InDyne, Inc. the incumbent, holds all required certifications and clearances, is familiar with the complexity of the facility and the equipment, and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional twenty-four month period.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>A Notice of Intent to issue a sole source extension for Western Range Operations, Communications &amp; Information (WROCI) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for a performance period of twenty-four months was publicized in FedBizOps on 24 Mar 2011. No sources other than incumbent have expressed an interest and willingness to provide the requested services for the contemplated extension period. Given the critical nature of the required services and the time constraints for performance, the incumbent contractor appears to be the only viable source for fulfillment of these requirements. <br /><br />XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO THE COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a follow-on contract (LISC) using full and open competition to include the WROCI contract in accordance with the FAR. The WROCI contract extension is a necessary interim step to provide these vital services until the follow-on contract is awarded.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>As evidenced by the signature on the Coordination and Approval Document, the WROCI Program Manager (PM), has certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>

<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>The Defense Logistics Agency will be issuing a solicitation for a follow-on corporate contract with Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS). The current corporate contract SPM4AX07D9006 covers only CAGE 0B9R9. The follow-on will cover all consumable and depot-level repairable NSNs that are sole source to CAGEs 0B9R9, 21849, and K0137, will contain approximately 1100 NSNs ,and will be valued at approximately $225,000,000.00. Some of the newly covered NSNs on this project have been purchased from small businesses over the past three years. Therefore, the Contracting Officer has concluded this requirement meets the definition of a significant bundling of contract requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He has further concluded the bundling is necessary and justified by measurably substantial benefits exceeding 5% of the contract value, in terms of inventory savings, administrative savings, and material cost avoidance.</p>
