<SUBJECT>B -- Report on Housing Practices and Public Health Measures
<DESC>00HCTBBG-2006-33332 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Brown University, Box 1929, 164 Angell Street, Providence RI 02912-1929. The authority of this sole source procurement is FAR 13.106-1. The CDC intends to conduct a study in Rhode Island that will provide information relevant to the correlation between environmental concerns and health issues involving chronic, episodic and acute pathophysiological conditions; and/or traumatic injury in the home. Rhode Island was chosen due to its small geographical region, and based on current census studies suggesting that most residents seldom relocate out of state or move to another jurisdiction or country within the state. Brown University will be required to identify and evaluate various preexisting surveys, instruments or tools that can be used to monitor housing quality and the resident’s health status as it directly relates to lead (Pb) toxicity and other environmental toxicants. Brown University will provide documentation in the form of technical guide based on pre-approved format. Brown University was chosen to provide these services based on the belief that they are the only vendor within the designated geographical region that posses the required experience working with local health, residential and environmental issues. Brown University is the only vendor believed to posses the necessary clinical and technical skills required to accomplish this work in a timely manner with accurate results. This not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of the publication date of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires may be sent to Russell Oxford by e-mail at efn3@cdc.gov or by fax to 770-488-2670.
