<DESC><p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be soliciting proposals for a contract to migrate, operate, maintain and enhance the AHRQ National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) resources, http://www.guideline.gov/ and http://www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov/.</p>
<p>AHRQ is the lead Federal agency charged with improving the quality, safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that provides evidence-based information about health care outcomes, quality, cost, use, and access. In addition, AHRQ is committed to preparing and deploying tools and materials that help our key target audiences understand how to put research findings and related products into practice. Equally important, AHRQ supports initiatives that disseminate and help move research into practice. As a result, health care decisionmakers are able to make informed decisions that improve the quality of health care services.</p>
<p>The NGC and NQMC are Internet-based tools for the collection, classification, and dissemination of evidence-based clinical practice guideline and health care quality measures, measure sets, and related information. These repositories are searchable databases of catalogued and indexed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and quality measures meeting explicit criteria, presented in a standardized fashion that facilitates comparisons and informed decisionmaking.</p>
<p>The goal of the NGC and the NQMC is to provide physicians, nurses, and other health professionals; health care providers; health plans; integrated delivery systems; purchasers and others an accessible mechanism for obtaining objective, detailed information on clinical practice guidelines and quality measures, respectively, and to further their dissemination, implementation and use in informed health care decision making.</p>
<p>The NGC and NQMC will be also be addressing implementation of stricter inclusion criteria, thereby raising the evidence bar to assure that guidelines and measures represented in the Clearinghouses have been developed using more robust methodology. In addition, the NGC will be implementing the Institute of Medicine's recommendation that NGC indicate the extent to which guidelines adhere to the standards for developing trustworthy guidelines.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>While there are IT components in this project, this is not an IT requirement. The project is content-driven supported by information technology.<br /><br />The objectives of this project are to:</p>
<p>&#61607; Develop, publish, update and archive content for NGC and NQMC (including HHS Measure Inventory as applicable), meeting production and quality goals<br />&#61607; Enhance content, presentation, and process, being responsive to shifts in landscape and user requirements<br />&#61607; Provide timely technical assistance to NGC and NQMC users<br />&#61607; Report on NGC and NQMC user experience<br />&#61607; Support content and project management efforts with information technology in accordance with regulatory, process and change controls, and stated requirements<br />&#61607; Maintain a modern software and hardware technical infrastructure<br />&#61607; Manage the project effectively, efficiently, and in accordance with requirements</p>
<p>AHRQ anticipates awarding one contract under this solicitation, for a period of one base year and four 1-year option periods. The Government is under no obligation to exercise the options either at award or at a later date.</p>

<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Titertek Berthold, 330 Winn Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35805 for the acquisition of yearly maintenance service for the Quadflex III EC, Auxiliary Digiflex, Quadflex III EC, and Auxiliary Digiflex. The purchase order will be for a base period of 12 months and two option periods of 12 months each.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. <br /><br />Titertek customized the Quadflex III liquid handling systems for the unique application of spotting human blood on special filter paper. These instruments are one-of-a kind products and only exist at CDC. They are imperative for the continuity of the Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program and Titertek is the only one allowed to provide maintenance for service of these instruments.<br /><br />As the original equipment manufacturer of these instruments, Titertek is the only contractor that can provide a) on-site repair which is usually the next normal business day response to service calls; b) emergency service for in-warranty instruments to correct any defects that impair the proper performance of the instrument at no additional cost; c) preventative maintenance and emergency repair actions during normal business hours, coordinated so that actions can be accomplished with a minimum of interference to operational use of the equipment; d) access to technical phone support during normal business hours; e) trained service staff qualified to diagnose problems and repair and maintain Titertek equipment; f) Titertek Field Engineers and Technicians and augmented by qualified independent, factory-trained technicians employed to provide more timely and cost effective service; g) scheduled planned yearly maintenance. <br /><br />Titertek provides service manuals to engineers containing service procedures applicable to the equipment trained on. Engineers periodically receive service information and updates, often consisting of compilations of recent problems and suggested methods of correction. The original equipment warranty information states that the manufacturer only ensures performance at original levels if genuine manufacturer parts or manufacturer trained technicians provide service. Titertek is the original equipment manufacturer and they will not provide service for equipment that they have not previously maintained.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Titertek Berthold. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2013-Q-15297 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN December 21, 2012. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Kenneth Tomer, Cary, NC 27518 for a modification to existing Order #HHSN273201200004I pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The modification will add an additional 520 hours and extend the performance period through December 31, 2013. This request is for Dr. Tomer to finalize existing laboratory research projects and resulting publications related to on-going research performed by the Mass Spectrometry Group as well as assist with the transition of projects to other laboratories. Specifically, Dr. Tomer will provide the following services per the Statement of Work: Scope: Under this order, the contractor will provide support services to satisfy the overall operational objectives of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Laboratory of Structural Biology. Support to the current non-trainee staff with techniques used in mass spectrometry; Support of specific techniques and analyses of differential surface modification, antibody: antigen interactions, and flash photolytic oxidation of proteins, protein characterization, including post-translational modifications, small molecule quantitation and metabolomics, and mass spectrometric aspects of proteomics as the staff transitions to a collaborative research staff; Assist with current projects within the Laboratory of Structural Biology; Support policy development to the Protein Microcharacterization Core; Assist trainee staff with placement assistance for obtaining permanent employment; Assist trainees with current projects. The justification for selection of Dr. Tomer is as follows: Dr. Tomer retired in December 2011 from the Laboratory of Structural Biology after twenty-five years at the NIEHS as a Senior Investigator. In order for Dr. Tomer to complete projects, fulfill his commitment to trainees in his laboratory and also provide guidance during a transition period, this mechanism is needed for the continuation of the closure of his laboratory. It is critical for the Mass Spectrometry Group to retain leadership stability until a new tenure-track Principle Investigator in mass spectrometry can be identified. NIEHS has invested in a significant level of mass spectrometry instrumentation, which has been used for collaborative research as well as for Dr. Tomer's independent research projects. Given present circumstances, it is highly doubtful if funds will be available to initiate a search for a tenure-track replacement in the near future. During this period, the current non-Trainee staff will continue to a collaborative research facility within the Laboratory of Structural Biology. Dr. Tomer will also continue to provide guidance to his Trainees until they obtain permanent employment and, especially, through the follow-on policy activities of the trans-NIH Biodefense grant.&nbsp; Dr. Tomer is the only person that can provide the support and guidance to the current non-Trainee staff with his unique capabilities in: techniques used in structural mass spectrometry including, differential surface modification, antibody: antigen interactions, and flash photolytic oxidation of proteins; protein characterization, including post-translational modifications; small molecule quantitation and metabolomics; and, mass spectrometric aspects of proteomics as the staff transitions to a collaborative research staff. He will provide guidance to the existing Trainees and work with them on their research projects until they obtain permanent employment. He will also recommend instrumentation developments and serve as an expert during a search for a permanent replacement. Due to the experience and expertise of Dr. Tomer, in addition to his impressive career at the Institute, he is the only person who is able to provide the services required. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability. Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Contracting Specialist at the address provided. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 6 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 6 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the modification will be issued with Dr. Tomer. The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$7.0 Million. This procurement is to be processed using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12 Commercial Item Acquisition of Commercial Items.<br />

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Diane Forsythe for a modification to existing Order #HHSN273201200003I pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The modification will add an additional 281 hours and extend the performance period through January 31, 2013. This request is for Dr. Forsythe to provide consulting services to the Comparative Medicine Branch regarding special animal projects and maintaining and resolving issues concerning AAALAC accreditation. The services requested require an in-depth knowledge of existing animal protocols and on-going research projects currently existing at NIEHS. Specifically, Dr. Forsythe will provide the following services per the Statement of Work: Scope: Under this order, the contractor will provide support services to satisfy the overall operational objectives of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Comparative Medicine Branch. Provide guidance to the Acting Chief on animal program issues; Assisting with oversight to the CMB budget; Assist with oversight of the animal space requirements; Assist with projects requested by the SD such as review of animal resources and cost accounting; Assisting with review of animal study proposals and service to the NIEHS Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC); Assisting with oversight of ongoing improvements being made to the Mouse Information Management System (MIMMS); Assisting with improvements and implementation of the E Sirius cost accounting and protocol management software; Serving as an alternate to the Acting Chief on various NIEHS and NIH committees (DIR Council, ARAC, APD, AFPAB, COOP); Assisting with animal program related training (CMB contract staff, investigators, lab animal residents/externs); and Assisting with orientation of new Branch Chief if necessary. The justification for selection of Dr. Forsythe is as follows: Dr. Forsythe has served as the Chief of the Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) since 1988 in addition to serving as the NIEHS Animal Program Director. Dr. Forsythe has an in-depth understanding of the NIEHS animal program and the requirements for maintaining AAALAC accreditation. The NIEHS has a continuing need for her services on an interim basis until a replacement is hired. The recruitment process for a replacement is already underway; however, a national search is required and the entire process can take up to an additional six months under the Title 42 guidelines. The NIEHS Scientific Director has named Dr. Mary Grant as the Acting Chief of the CMB until a replacement for Dr. Forsythe is hired; however, the availability of Dr. Forsythe for consultation to the CMB is critical during this interim period prior to the arrival of a permanent Branch Chief. It is necessary for the Division of Intramural Research to retain the ability to consult and seek advice and guidance from Dr. Forsythe. Dr. Forsythe will continue to provide assistance and guidance to Dr. Grant on animal program issues. Due to the experience Dr. Forsythe possesses from her many years of experience at the NIEHS in the capacity of CMB Branch Chief, she is the only person who is able to provide the services required by this Term Purchase Order. As a retiree, Dr. Forsythe is able to bring experience and knowledge of the animal program without any bias or conflict. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability. Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Contracting Specialist at the address provided. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 6 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk intends to acquire predictive screening test services in support of Naval Hospital Twenty-nine Palms (NHTP), California. NHTP requires a specific type of genetic testing called the BRAC Analysis which can detect mutations with the BRCA gene. This is a sole source action to be awarded as a contract to Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah. NAVSUP FLCNs intent is to issue a firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR 15 (Contracting by Negotiation) procedures.  The contract is needed as soon as possible and the anticipated period of performance, according to the PALT, is from 01 May 2013 through 30 April 2014 with two one-year options.
  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Myriad is the only laboratory that provides BRAC Analysis testing services. Myriad scientists discovered the mutated BRCA gene and own the patent on the technology required to perform the testing.
Challengers may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by sending challenges to Lauren Lauver at lauren.lauver@navy.mil. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all challenges to this sole source determination by the specified response date will be considered by the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.

<DESC>NSN 1R-5307-014442264-V2, REF NR 901-011-160-101, QTY 30 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to
support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS.
<p>This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. The work consists of furnishing all labor, equipment, appliances, devices and materials, and performing all operations necessary in connection with the "On-Call" Airfield Pavement Markings and Base-wide Road Pavement Markings. The site of the work is the Airfield in Area A and Area B, and Area A and Area B Base-wide Roads located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.</p>
<p>Each call written against this contract shall have a performance period stating the required start date and the construction duration and expected completion date. Emergency situations will require a start work response time as short as one day. Aircraft and vehicular traffic cause pavement markings to crack, peel and fade over time; resulting in the need for periodic maintenance (painting overlay or paint removal and repainting). Aircraft landings cause a build-up of tire rubber. In one year of normal airfield operations, the rubber build-up covers existing pavement markings causing a safety problem for landing aircraft. The rubber needs to be removed a minimum of once a year and the markings repainted. Heavy usage would require removal and repainting twice a year. Salt applications and snow removal on the airfield and roadways also cause deteriorated pavement markings: snow plows degrade and damage the reflective beads on the pavement markings. Satisfactory markings are required to enhance safety on both roads and airfield pavements. This project reapplies markings on both road and airfield pavements and removes markings as required.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 5-year (Base year plus 4 option years) period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>2012 NAICS Code: 237310, Size Standard: $33.5M.</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation are highly encouraged to submit the following by 3:00 p.m. (local Dayton time) on 21 Dec 2013:</p>
<p>Responses should include the following: <br />(1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a Prime Contractor;<br />(2) provide your DUNS Number or CAGE Code. <br />(3) list of work experience similar to the type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact with their phone numbers, and an explanation of the relevancy of the project (limit to 5 single-sided pages); <br />(4) documents from surety (or their agent) of bid bond, payment bond and performance bond capability for this project;<br />(5) If you are considering a HUBZone Joint Venture that has not been SBA approved, specify the name of the firm you intend to form a joint venture, and the steps you will take to obtain SBA certification before proposal due date.<br />(6) a copy of 8(a) approval and certification; and/or<br />(7) date of HUBZone certification; and/or<br />(8) documentation of SDVOSB status</p>
<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation by e-mail (preferred) to mandie.lee@wpafb.af.mil and james.bane@wpafb.af.mil or fax 937-257-2825. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested Small Business, 8(a) program participants, HUBZone, or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 10 pages. Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered "non-responsive" in this requirement. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a set-aside or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a modification in the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>

IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. Project 040400, Replace A/C/D System Pumps, Facility 31240. Project scope includes the removal of the eight (8) existing High Temperature Hot Water (HTHW) circulating system pumps, installation of five (5) new HTHW pumps with Variable Frequency Drives (VFD), and all pump controls, piping, and electric service in facility 31240. Scope also includes a cross connect between the three systems and flow balancing valves to be installed to ensure proper flow of HTHW to the three different systems.<br />HTHW systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. Contractor needs to be aware Construction timelines are very tight since these repairs cannot be started until after the HTHW system is turned off, and must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. Work will need to be carefully coordinated with the plant to minimize impact to mission. There is a high probability that anther critical project will also be in construction while this project is under way.

<a href="mailto:lance.drennan@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command - New Jersey in support of the Armament, Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) intends to solicit, negotiate, and enter into a section 845 Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with the National Small Arms Technology Consortium (NSATC).  Section 845 of Public Law 103-160, as amended, authorizes the use of OTAs, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, under certain circumstances for prototype initiatives directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems proposed to be acquired or developed by the DoD.   <br> The government has a need to team with industry, academic, and nonprofit partners through establishment of an Other Transaction agreement with Small Arms consortium members. Through the proposed agreement, the Government's primary objective is to collaborate with a consortium to perform a coordinated research and development program designed to develop prototype technologies improving U.S. industry, university, and Government capabilities as required to sustain U.S. military supremacy in Small Arms technologies.  <br>  <br> A consortium comprised of educational, nonprofit, and commercial organizations and with broad and open membership is required to provide the Government a partner able to collaborate across barriers that include military/civilian, public/private, local/regional/national, and political/jurisdictional concerns. The consortium should be open to new membership and display a broad array of expertise and experience, connected to small arms related technologies and applications.   <br> OTA's for prototype initiatives are acquisition instruments that generally are not subject to the federal laws and regulations governing procurement (FAR based) contracts.   As such, they are not required to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), its supplements (i.e., DFARS) or laws that are limited in applicability to procurement contracts.  To be eligible for an OTA instrument, the proposing contractor must be a non-traditional contractor or have at least one nontraditional defense contractor participating to a significant extent OR provide a one third cost sharing. <br> Under the proposed agreement, members of the NSATC shall perform research, development and engineering activities, which address the Army's long-range research, development, engineering and production goals pertaining to hand guns, shoulder fired weapons, grenade launchers, machine guns, automatic cannons and other ground weapons/devices such as a lightweight acoustic and directed energy weapons.  Also included are small arms ammunition; hand gun launched and rocket grenades; fire control; embedded computers; power supplies; fuzing and the soldier/gun/vehicle interface. <br>  <br> The Center will engage in broad areas of research and development leading to prototypes to include weapon systems, subassemblies such as fire control, fuzing and power supplies, materials and material behavior, coatings, manufacturing science and technology, modeling and simulation and failure analysis.  The Center will also foster specialized education and training as necessary consistent with the goals of the Center.   <br>  <br> A formal written solicitation is not planned.   <br>  <br> Any responsible/interested sources shall submit their qualifications and capabilities within fifteen (15) business days of this notice to: US Army Contracting Command New Jersey, ATTN: ACC-NJ-ET, Mr. Lance P. Drennan Bldg. 10B, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000 or submit the information electronically to the email address lance.p.drennan.civ@mail.mil. Information submitted should include your organization, personnel, facilities, applicable subcontractor network and past experience to meet specific needs stated above. Include company name, address, telephone number, technical point of contact, item nomenclature, item description, and brochure/literature. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement.  <br> Electronic submittals are preferred.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
<p>The purpose of this SS is to identify businesses that are interested in a study on "Genetic Testing Services" for Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP), Clinical Trial Number: NCT00369421, Protocol Number: 76-HG-0238, providing biochemical and molecular testing for genetic syndromes, inborn errors of metabolism, and mitochondrial diseases for clinical and research programs.</p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible businesses, under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 621511, Medical Laboratories, with business size standard of $13.5M Per Annum.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge.</p>
<p>The DIR-NHGRI- Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP) protocol 76-HG-0238, Clinical Trial Number: NCT00369421 are connected to this clinical testing, which began in 2008 as a vehicle for admitting patients with broader range of inborn errors of metabolism. Under this observational protocol study, patients with long-standing, complex undiagnosed diseases are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for comprehensive evaluation to discover new genetic disorders and/or potential treatments. The UDP program has made 47 diagnoses, which is about 20% of the total number of patients seen in this protocol to date. Ongoing research continues<br />to find diagnosis on the other patients who have been seen in the UDP to date. <br /><br />The Researchers in the Protocol study intend on diagnosing and treating certain inborn errors of metabolism. By doing this, researchers hope to expand their knowledge about these disorders and provide access to patients of interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Patients enrolled in this protocol have been referred with a known or suspected inborn error of metabolism, heritable disorder, or genetic predisposition. Patients participating in this study will be examined and treated on an outpatient basis, if practical. However, patients requiring specialized tests or treatments will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center as necessary. Researchers will use only accepted medical procedures in diagnosing (medical history, physical examinations, X-ray studies, eye examinations, blood tests, and urine tests) and treating the patients involved in this study. Additional tests may be required on a case by case basis. UDP has a critical need for expertise in clinical and laboratory genetic services, a key component in current and future clinical study results.</p>

<DESC>The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. The Department of State is conducting Sources Sought to determine the number of&nbsp;HUBZone--who are considered a HUBZone concern under North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 541519.The Government must ensure that there is adequate capability, experience, and competition among the potential pool of responsible contractors. Therefore, the purpose of this Sources Sought is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of&nbsp;HUBZone within the industry. As stated, the intended audience of this Sources Sought includes ALL&nbsp;HUBZONE Concerns.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DoS), Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) mission is to ensure that U.S. diplomacy is informed by the best possible intelligence and analytical insights, and that Intelligence Community (IC) activities are consistent with and supportive of the country's national security and foreign policy objectives. The primary purpose of INR is to manage intelligence information to serve the foreign and domestic needs of the Secretary of State, the President's representatives (ambassadors) and functional and regional DoS bureaus. The Intelligence and Research Information Support System (INRISS) is the primary information processing system utilized in INR. In addition, it also interfaces with other IC activities and Communities of Interests (COIs). The INRISS system became operational for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) processing in 1987.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only seeking responses from Small Businesses. Large and Non Profit Businesses are not to respond. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to this 541810 NAICS Code. Teaming is encouraged. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.
<p>The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and two option years. After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time. Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the questions listed below. In addition, please provide a capability statement addressing your organization's ability to perform as a prime contractor the work described below.<br /><br />Project Title: National Outreach, Public Education, and Engagement Initiatives (NOPEEI) (National Campaigns)<br /><br />The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was created in 1992 to work in collaboration with States to improve prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services for individuals with mental and/or substance use disorders. Its vision is to provide leadership and devote its resources toward helping the Nation act on the knowledge that: behavioral health is essential for health, prevention works, treatment is effective and people recover from mental and substance use disorders. Toward that end, SAMHSA has identified Public Awareness and Support as one of the lead strategic initiative efforts with an emphasis on increasing the public understanding about mental and substance use disorders and the numerous issues associated with increasing public acceptance and furthering self determination and support for those in recovery from these conditions. This will be the umbrella for setting the strategic direction for SAMHSA's communications work through 2014 to help people with mental and/or substance use disorders and their families build strong and supportive communities, prevent costly behavioral health problems, be resilient after traumatic experiences and promote better health for all Americans.<br /><br />Individuals with mental and/or substance use disorders experience high rates of trauma, unemployment, homelessness, poverty, social isolation, discrimination, poor health outcomes, and early mortality. Despite promising new approaches, little improvement has taken place and these individuals remain continually marginalized and excluded from their communities. Additionally, prejudice and discrimination have been identified as major impediments to social inclusion.<br /><br />Public education and outreach to SAMHSA's mission-oriented constituencies has been a cornerstone of SAMHSA's efforts to prevent and reduce the incidence of mental and substance use disorders and the trauma associated with these disorders. Moreover, SAMHSA's legislative Authority (SEC. 501. 290aa. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION) and subsequent Congressional mandates (Section 2(d) of the 2006 Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act (STOP Act)) call for SAMHSA to carry out public information and knowledge dissemination functions on these issues and those that promote the integration of substance abuse and mental health services into the framework of the newly adopted Affordable Care Act. <br /><br />Within this context, SAMHSA seeks to engage key constituencies and service providers from the prevention, mental health services, and addiction treatment fields to conduct efforts that will help to promote increased public awareness and understanding of the multitude of issues that currently hinder the advancement of wellness as well as those that can promote the wellbeing of those affected by mental and/or substance use disorders. Through these efforts, SAMHSA will engage the public in a broad dialogue about how to prevent, treat, and broaden public and familial connectedness and support for those affected by mental and/or substance use disorders so we can continue to reduce the incidence of mental illnesses and addictions and generate the necessary support to get people into treatment as well as to sustain those in recovery from these conditions.<br /><br />The purpose of this Contract is to provide communications support for national outreach and public education initiatives across a variety of behavioral health topics. SAMHSA is working to improve the understanding and awareness of mental and substance use disorders, promote emotional health and the prevention of substance abuse and mental illness, increase access to effective treatment, and support recovery. Guided by SAMHSA's strategic plan, this Contract will support public education initiatives which advance critical and timely elements of SAMHSA's mission. <br /><br />One of the tasks for the base year is to continue a national underage drinking prevention campaign in concurrence with the direction of the United States Congress, in consultation with the industry, advocates, and other interested parties, for an underage drinking prevention public service campaign directed at parents. The campaign targets educational efforts to parents of children aged 9 to 15. It identifies and promulgates research-based public health messages and activities, and supports national and local media efforts to reduce underage drinking. A workgroup including representatives of the private and public sectors, including representatives from the industry and advocacy organizations working in the prevention of underage drinking, advises the process and participates in a mutually acceptable, comprehensive public service campaign over the period of this Contract.<br /><br />The focus for the base year will be to continue to promote, disseminate, and evaluate the public education messages developed by SAMHSA's Underage Drinking Prevention National Media Campaign. These campaign implementation efforts will utilize SAMHSA's communication platforms and the network of intermediary partners as well as coordinate across SAMHSA's related public education efforts. This Contract directly supports Goal 1.2 - Prevent or reduce consequences of underage drinking and adult problem drinking, SAMHSA's Strategic Initiative #1 - Prevention of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness. In the second and third years (Option Years 1 and 2), the focus will be to refresh the messages and products targeted to parents based on the lessons learned from each iteration of the underage drinking media campaign.<br /><br />Early alcohol initiation among youths is associated with alcohol dependence or abuse. In 2011, adults aged 21 or older who had first used alcohol at age 14 or younger were over 7 times more likely to have alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year than adults who had their first drink at age 21 or older (13.8 vs. 1.8 percent) (2011 NSDUH).</p>
<p>Among youths, alcohol dependence or abuse is also associated with depression. In 2011, 23.7 percent of youths aged 12 to 17 (224,000 youths) with alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year also had past-year major depressive episode (MDE) (2011 NSDUH). Moreover, alcohol dependence or abuse among youths is related to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide.<br /><br />Recent neuroscience research has suggested the harmful effects of alcohol on youth brain development. Underage drinking is strongly correlated with poor school performance, risky sexual behavior, delinquent behaviors, motor vehicle crashes, violence, and crimes. <br /><br />Thus, underage drinking and related problems have profound detrimental consequences for underage drinkers, their families, and our society. SAMHSA recognizes addressing underage drinking is a high priority goal in the improvement of prevention and intervention services.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates fourteen HC-144A aircraft. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The HC-144A aircraft is manufactured by EADS CASA based in Seville, Spain. The base CASA CN-235-300M provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A aircraft. The USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) and require particular aircraft parts and accessory replacement to accomplish this task.</p>
<p>USCG OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center, Elizabeth City, North Carolina is seeking alternate sources that can provide any or all spare component items listed in Attached Product List. Only new items are acceptable; reconditioned or used materials are not acceptable. The USCG will not be able to provide manuals or drawings for this requirement. Interested parties must have access to the OEM data and manuals.

Also, state approximate lead-time for delivery of your product, provide details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Additionally, detail if the product has been qualified for use in any Department of Defense (DoD) or Federal Government Aircraft. The applicable NAICS code is 336413 - Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing.</p>
<p>REPLIES:</p>
<p>Please respond to the following questions: (1) is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified Hub Zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm certified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, provide POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions.</p>
<p>After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still intends to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published on the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) website. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation separately.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to Aviation Logistics Center, 1664 Weeksville Road, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, Attention: John Travers, Contract Specialist, MRS Division or emailed to John.R.Travers@USCG.mil.

The contract award builds upon Stemnions successful completion of pre-clinical animal trials and the appropriate pre-clinical animal safety testing.  The latter included multiple toxicology studies that resulted in FDA permission to proceed with a 2009 Phase I human clinical trial using ACCS to demonstrate safety in the treatment of partial thickness burns.  The Phase I human trial outcomes demonstrated safety in the treatment regimen and allowed Stemnion to proceed to the next round of clinical trials.
  Those efforts include: 

	Preparation and Development of Materials for Research and Clinical Trials 
	ACCS Research & Development: formulations for controlled-release, release to specific tissues and to stabilize the ACCS for storage at room temperature.
	Immunology
	Ocular Surface Disorder/Dry Eye Clinical Trial

The estimated value of this contract is $30.660 million. The period of performance for this contract is anticipated to be a base period of 12 months with two optional periods.  The first option period will be for 12 months.  The second option period will be for 18 months.  Stemnion controls over 20 patents pending that are directly related to the AMP cell and ACCS cytokine solution therapies that are entering FDA Phase I and Phase II clinical trials.
 Stemnion is positioning itself to have a first-in-class, FDA-approved product for use in wound healing and, eventually, other clinical applications as well.

Although other companies will be able to produce their own products based on their own proprietary technology and cells, it will be very difficult for a company to develop a generic version of Stemnions product for several reasons.
The first is that Stemnions products are very complex biologicals which would be hard to replicate.  Stemnion was chosen because their cell and conditioned media possess unique properties that are not found in products from other companies.  Secondly, Stemnions confidential, proprietary process would be difficult if not impossible to copy.
 Thirdly, the Affordable Care Act provides for 12 years of data exclusivity for new biologics such as Stemnions products. Therefore, once Stemnions product is FDA-approved, even if a company were able to make a same or similar product (termed a biosimilar) it would still have to wait 12 years before being allowed to rely on data generated by Stemnion to obtain FDA approval. This would force a company interested in producing a biosimilar to commit millions of dollars and years of research to generate their own preclinical and clinical data.

Based on these unique capabilities and the previous work done with Stemnion.  Stemnion is the only company capable of meeting the Governments requirements.
  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data and other information sufficient to determine capability to perform the proposed contract effort.

All capability statements received by 10:00AM local Time on December 21, 2012, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to wayne.medina@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>NASA is releasing an open letter to the geosynchronous satellite community encouraging discussion on proposed cooperative servicing aids, features that could be incorporated into new satellites to facilitate future on-orbit servicing. The letter was written in response to requests following NASAs 2012 Second International Workshop on On-Orbit Satellite Servicing. To foster discussion, the letter includes a list of proposed cooperative servicing aids. Suggestions range from low-impact activities such as imaging the spacecraft on the ground at the same wavelength the on-orbit rendezvous sensor would be using, to more involved activities such as adding a standardized docking feature to a satellite during its build phase. The full letter with proposed list of cooperative servicing aids can be found in the attached file described as "NASA Cooperative Servicing Aids Letter."

<p>Description of Services:</p>
<p>Laboratories performing testing on specimens derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease, or the impairment of, or the assessment of the health of, human beings must meet the requirements set forth in AFIP Pamphlet 40-24, 01 September 2007, Department of Defense Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program (DOD CLIP). The CLIP is DoD's equivalent program to Federal law regulating civilian laboratories, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (42 CFR 493), which is overseen by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>
<p>This procurement shall provide accreditation services, to include on-site inspections to be performed by a CMS-approved accreditation organization authorized to evaluate, validate, and enforce compliance.  The accreditation cycle shall include DoD laboratories of all CLIA-designated complexity categories (i.e., Waived, Provider Performed Microscopy, Moderate Complexity, and High Complexity).  The accreditation services should also include an internal self-inspection, monitored by the accrediting entity, utilizing contractor provided inspection checklists.  The inspection agency must also evaluate complaints from patients, commanders or other users.  Reports of complaint inspections are governed by 10 U.S.C 1102 as quality assurance documents.</p>
<p>This procurement shall provide an annual proficiency testing program that must include samples of organisms and/or specimens that are representative of analytes or specimens tested.  Laboratories are then evaluated on their performance and must successfully score at least 80 percent of acceptable responses for performance for the testing event.  Unsatisfactory analyte performance in 2 of 3 or 3 of 4 consecutive testing events will be considered unsuccessful analyted performance.  The proficiency testing program will furnish products/surveys containing proficiency testing challenges for analytes and tests regulated by CMS as stated in 42 CFR Part 493, Subpart I - Proficiency Testing Programs for Non-waived Testing.  The PT program must include all regulated analytes and tests for all specialties and subspecialties in the clinical laboratory and anatomic pathology services as required within Subpart I.  The PT program shall also include challenges for non-regulated analytes and tests sufficient to maximize coverage of the non-regulated analytes and tests performed in DoD laboratories.  The frequency of inclusion of non-regulated analyte and test PT challenges in a PT program should, as a minimum, satisfy the frequency requirements listed in 42 CFR 493.1253 through 493.1255 and the CLIP requirement of two challenges per year. The proficiency testing program furnished products/surveys shall be acceptable to the accrediting agency. The proficiency testing program shall also provide any other proficiency-related materials as may be helpful in fostering laboratory compliance with CLIA.  Such materials may include, but are not limited to, surveys/materials for Instrument Calibration and/or Linearity Verification, Personnel Competency Testing modules, and Quality Management or Educational surveys.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  All information shall be furnished at a no cost or obligation to the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses received, will be made entirely at the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit information to Mr. Stephen Ching at Stephen.ching@tma.osd.mil no later than 13 December 2012 at 12:00PM Eastern Standard Time.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For 
Other Than Full and Open Competition
1. 	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 12, William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital (Station 607).   Transaction number 607-13-1-129-0001 and 607-13-1-129-0002.

2.   Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The Transplant/Surgical Service is required to rent/purchase Thoratec VAD devices, and all supporting expendable items, for all heart transplant candidates who require mechanical support.  The Dual Drive Console (DDC) system that is rented here is the controller for the Thoratec TLC ventricular assist device that helps to support the patient's cardiac function.  Without the system, the result would be a dramatic drop in the cardiac output and thus put the patient at risk of cardiac failure and arrest.

3. 	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Madison VA is required to rent the Thoratec DDC as it is the only device that controls the Thoratec TLC VAD device.  This VAD device is implanted in patients at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics and without the DDC portion of the system we would not be able to control the cardiac output of the patients.  The device is rented on a monthly basis at $7,500.00/month.

4.	 Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

( X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;

( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 
	6.302-3;
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4

( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;

( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;

( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.    Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The Thoratec VAD system is specifically requested since we currently have a contract with the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics (UWHC) for transplant services (Contract number VA69D-P-1750).  Part of that contract includes the cost of the VAD device itself as well as the surgical procedure to implant and remove the device.  UWHC only uses the Thoratec VAD system and we must procure devices and expendables that are compatible with the Thoratec system.   The Thoratec system mentioned here is the only system that will be compatible for us to provide the necessary care and life support required for veterans requiring ventricular assistance.  Our need is to provide the highest quality care in the most cost effective manner.  Because patients are scheduled for this procedure with very little notice, our need for this equipment is usually of an urgent nature and we are compelled by the request from the Chief of Staff and Directors Office to emergently provide this equipment.  Thoratec can provide this equipment within 24 hours which meets the needs of the patient, facility and contract with UWHC and they are the only VAD device that is FDA approved.
  

6. 	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:   None.  No other system is compatible with the Thoratec VAD system.  UWHC exclusively uses Thoratec devices and supplies and under our contract agreement with them we are required to use this product.

7. 	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The contracting officer anticipates the cost will be considered fair and reasonable and provides the following basis for this determination IAW FAR Part 13.106(a). Cost is deemed reasonable due to prior awards to Thoratec for the same/similar pricing and based on commercial catalog pricing available to the general public. 

8. 	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons 
Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10. Market research revealed that Thoratec is the only company that is FDA approved. There are 9 prior actions for same/similar items on FBO.
The Medical Staff at VA Madison and UW Madison currently use this equipment and are knowledgeable about the medical equipment available on the commercial marketplace thru medical conferences and networking. The medical staff are subject matter experts and they know there is no other company that can provide the needed equipment. No other companies were found on the internet that were compatible with Thoratec equipment that is implanted in patients. 
A search of the FDA revealed that Thoratec has the only FDA-approved LVAD for Destination Therapy, or permanent support. 

9. 	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  The VA is required to use the Thoratec TLC DDC system as it is the only device that is compatible with the Thoratec TLC VAD device.

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to
Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:   None.  We are required to use the Thoratec TLC DDC system as it is the only device that is compatible with the Thoratec TLC VAD device. 


12. Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the
Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the
justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

The solicitation number is W912PF-13-T-0009 and this solicitation is issued as a Request For Quote (RFQ). The solicitation is unrestricted and all interested offerors shall submit written quotes (oral quotes will not be accepted). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 562991.  <br>  <br> The purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation is to provide twenty (20) portable toilets and three (3) hand-wash stations at three (3) separate locations in Douala, Cameroon. <br>  <br>  Offerors are required to indicate the daily cost of the portable toilets including all costs per the paragraph 3.

Provide three (3) Past Performance Questionnaires: see below. <br>  <br> The government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  <br>  <br> Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - The addendum to paragraph (a) is as follows: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  <br>  <br> The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  <br>  <br> 1. Technical Capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement per 3. Specific Requirements in the Performance Work Statement; <br>  <br> 2. Past Performance: This factor will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on three (3) Past Performance Questionnaires submitted as to whether the past performance is relevant and demonstrates successful past performance by the vendor, such as: no terminations for default, no ratings less than satisfactory by its customers/references, whether the quality of its work was satisfactory and completed in a timely manner and whether  the vendor demonstrated reasonableness and cooperation during performance of the contracts. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of unacceptable past performance. In addition, failure to meet the quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor to consider in determining unsatisfactory performance. <br> Past Performance Evaluation Ratings: <br> Acceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance is unknown.  <br> Unacceptable- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br> For Past Performance to be considered relevant, it must be similar in work and must be completed in the last three years from the date of this solicitation.  In the case of a quote without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the vendor shall be determined to have unknown past performance. Unknown shall be considered acceptable. The Government will conduct a past performance assessment on all contracts submitted by the vendor on the attached Past Performance Questionnaire. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance. The Government will consider the Past Performance information, as well as information obtained from any other sources.; and  <br> 3.  Price will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness and for unbalanced pricing. <br>  <br> Clauses included: FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commerical Items; FAR 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.214-34 - Submission of Offers in the English Language; FAR 52.225-14 - Inconsistency Between English Version and Translation of Contract; FAR 52.225-17 - Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers; FAR 52.222-50 Combat Trafficking in Persons; FAR 52.228-3 Worker's Compensation Insurance (Defense Base Act); FAR 52.233-1 Disputes; FAR 52.233-3 Protest After Award; FAR 52.238-3 Workers Compensation Insurance; FAR 52.252-1 - Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference; FAR 52.252-2 - Clauses Incorporated by Reference; FAR 52.232-8- Discounts for Prompt Payment; FAR 52.237-2 Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation; FAR 52.242-15 - Stop-Work Order; DFARS 252.201-7000 Contracting Officer's Representative; DFARS 252.222-7002 Compliance with Local Labor Laws (Overseas); DFARS 252.223-7006 Prohibition on Storage and Disposal of Toxic and Hazardous Materials; DFARS 252.225-7041 Correspondence in English; DFARS 252.225-7042 Authorization to Perform; DFARS 252.225-7043 Antiterrorism/Force Protection for Defense Contractors Outside the United States; DFARS 252.232-7008 Assignment of Claims (Overseas).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical, past performance and price.<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are slightly more important when combined when compared to price.

The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offer.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions. Also, 52.212-2(b) above does not apply to this requirement since there are no options.</p>

<p>The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation in full text:</p>
<p>52.27-103-72 DOJ CONTRACTOR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT BUREAU OF PRISONS (JUNE 2004)</p>
<p>For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:<br />1. Legally resided in the United States (U.S.);<br />2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or<br />3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.<br />If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm<br />By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 26540.2F (NOV 2008)</p>
<p>Department of Justice (DOJ) Order 2640.2F prohibits the use of non-U.S. citizens in the performance of this contract or commitment for any position that involves access to or assisting in the development, operation, management, or maintenance of any DOJ Information Technology System. By signing this contract or by beginning performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>52.24-403-70 NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)</p>
<p>Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are <br />listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required; <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1(a) and 1(b) above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p>3. Intermittent Contractors:</p>
<p>An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p>5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM's instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code <br />"3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. [End of Clause]&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)</p>
<p>During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor work force will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency <br />periods. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.</p>
<p>The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: <br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. <br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. <br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. <br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. <br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. <br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. <br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. <br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.&nbsp;<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. <br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2. Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, in the Federal Acquisition Regulations. [End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.232-99 Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (Deviation) (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012.<br />(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.<br />(b) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.<br />(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;ADDITIONAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Contractors are advised that the Contracting Officer will verify registration in the System for Award Management database (www.sam.gov) and the company's Representations and Certifications prior to award of any contract by entering the potential awardee DUNS number into the database. Failure to complete the registration may result in elimination from consideration for award.</p>
<p>Contractors are further advised to mark each individual item within their offer considered privileged or confidential under the Freedom of Information Act with notification that the data is considered confidential and privileged and not subject to mandatory disclosure under the FOIA.</p>

PRICE AND DELIVERY ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product <br />Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ <br />___________________ <br />___________________ <br />___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction applies only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system. <br />(End of instructions)</p>

<p>Line Item 0001: Analytical Support.</p>
<p>I.	BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>NIST requires outside analytical support for a variety of projects that all relate to the environmental, health and safety (EHS) aspects of engineered nanomaterials.  Specifically, NIST requires total elemental composition analysis of aqueous samples to quantify stock solutions of engineered nanoparticles and determine their respective dissolution rates under various environmental conditions.  This project is related to NIST's support of the interagency-collaborative National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI).  NIST is tasked with developing the metrology required to support science-based risk assessment protocols, and the requested outside analytical support is required to meet our objectives in this area.</p>
<p>The contract objective is to obtain outside analytical support for precise and timely elemental composition analysis of aqueous samples at a reasonable cost.  The results will be used in quantifying dissolution rates of engineered nanoparticles and adjust stock solution concentrations for various advanced surface analysis techniques.</p>

www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the interested contractors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.
 Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a quote not to be accepted by the Government. 

The following Clauses are applicable:


FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractors  whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.
    (i)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM SERVICE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT
    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE
   (iii)  PRICE

Quotes will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
  Under this factor, quotes will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the quote to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those quotes which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those quotes determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with quoting contractors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the quoting contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM SERVICE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(4) The contractor shall provide documentation of license in the state the business operates in and compliance with all Federal, State, Local laws, regulations to ensure compliance with all EPA regulations. Quoting Contractors technical information will be used to determine whether the items or services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items or services quoted, as provided in Quoting Contractors technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.
  Quotes which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

(c)  Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required, will be used to make a determination of whether the quoting contractor has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Quoting Contractors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.
 

Quoting Contractors which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any quote which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other quotes.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting contractors past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the quoting contractors past performance.

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Quoting contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

(e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoting contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, USAID/RDMA intends to issue a solicitation for the ASEAN-U.S. Partnership for Good Governance, Equitable and Sustainable Development and Security (ASEAN-U.S. PROGRESS) activity to provide technical assistance, training, materials, and other resources as needed to support and enhance ASEAN's capacity to advance good governance and regional security, and to promote equitable and sustainable human development in Southeast Asia in line with ASEAN Political-Security and Socio-Cultural Blueprints, as well as the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership Plan of Action 2011-2015 (PoA). The activity will also provide technical assistance to the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia, in order to expand its capacity to facilitate and support meetings, agreements and protocols and outreach central to ASEAN's regional integration agenda.
<p>The overall development goal of the activity is to enhance ASEAN's ability to advance good governance, regional security and equitable and sustainable human development. It will focus on improving regional responses and ASEAN-U.S. cooperation to address emerging regional and global challenges. The activity will contribute to the overall ASEAN-U.S. Partnership Program effort.</p>
<p>The component objectives of the activity are: (a) enhancing ASEAN's ability to advance good governance and political and security integration, particularly in the areas of public-private sector dialogue, promotion of human rights, cooperation to combat transnational crimes and non-traditional security threats; (b) enhancing ASEAN's ability to advance socio-cultural integration, particularly in the areas of women's and children's rights, disaster management, and the capacity and quality of science-based policy-making; and (c) supporting the ASEAN Secretariat's function to facilitate and support meetings, agreements and protocols central to the three Pillars, as well as Secretariat's implementation of the ASEAN-U.S. PoA, the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI), and the Masterplan on Connectivity, particularly in the areas of project management, capacity for outreach and use of ICT in Secretariat's activities. In addition, the activity will incorporate coordination and communications support for overall USAID assistance to ASEAN. Reflecting the demand-driven nature of U.S. assistance to ASEAN and to take advantage of "windows of opportunity" that were not present or accounted for at the design/award stage, the activity will provide flexibility to address other relevant elements of the ASEAN Community Blueprints and the ASEAN-U.S. PoA.</p>
<p>USAID/RDMA envisions a combination of technical assistance, training and grants (for either U.S. or ASEAN-region based organizations) to ensure rapid response to emerging opportunities to achieve activity objectives. USAID also places emphasis on the utilization of regional expertise and partnerships in the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

12. Description:
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-R-200008 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-62.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.  The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price contract for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:  
SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET FOR REQUIREMENTS
It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  
Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  
Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 
The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

Cost or Pricing Data
It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition.  However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.

Evaluation  Commercial Items 
Proposals will be evaluated and contract issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  
Technically Acceptable:  Proposals must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact.: <br /><br />Christopher J.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the phase-in, phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by this contract are maintained at the required level of proficiency.
  (c)  The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to remain on the job to help the successor maintain the continuity and consistency of the services required by this contract.

SECTION D - CONTRACT DOCUMENTS, EXHIBITS, OR ATTACHMENTS
	
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.	Contracting Officer's Authority.  The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this Order, and notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this Contract and Order, the said authority remains solely within the Contracting Officer.  In the event the Contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the changes will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.

2.	Indemnification.  The Contractor shall save and hold harmless and indemnify the Government against any and all liability claims, and cost of whatsoever kind and nature for injury to or death of any person or persons and for loss or damage to any Contractor property or property owned by a third party occurring in connection with or in any way incident to or arising out of the occupancy, use service, operation, or performance of work under the terms of the Contract and this Order, resulting in whole or in part from the acts or omissions of the Contractor, any subcontractor, or any employee, agent, or representative of the Contractor or subcontractor.  

3.	Government's Liability.  The Government shall not be liable for any injury to the Contractor's personnel or damage to the Contractor's property unless such injury or damage is due to negligence on the part of the Government and is recoverable under the Federal Torts Claims Act, or pursuant to other Federal statutory authority.
 


SECTION E - SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

E.1  52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
            (a) The Government will award a contract on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of Acceptable must be achieved for the Technical Factor.
 All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel.  The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of proposals.
 All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first evaluate the total proposed price of all Offerors.  Thereafter, the Government will evaluate the technical proposal of the lowest priced Offeror only.  If the lowest priced Offeror's technical proposal is determined to be rated as Acceptable, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further evaluation of the remaining Offerors' technical proposals.  If the lowest priced Offeror's technical proposal  is determined to be rated as Unacceptable, then the Government may evaluate the next lowest priced technical proposal, and so forth and so on, until the Government reaches the lowest priced technical proposal that is determined to be  rated as Acceptable.  However, the Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors' technical proposals should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government's best interest.
 The proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.  Proposals which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
 1.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.  The evaluation process will consider the extent to which the proposal provides a service agreement as either the manufactuer or an authorized representative of the manufactuer on all requested equipment at the sites listed.
2.   PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  The Government will evaluate offers by adding the total of all line item prices.  The Total Evaluated Price will be that sum.
    (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)
E.2  52.216-1  TYPE OF CONTRACT  (APR 1984)
  The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation.
(End of Provision)
E.3  VAAR 852.270-1  REPRESENTATIVES OF CONTRACTING OFFICERS (JAN 2008)
  The contracting officer reserves the right to designate representatives to act for him/her in furnishing technical guidance and advice or generally monitor the work to be performed under this contract. Such designation will be in writing and will define the scope and limitation of the designee's authority. A copy of the designation shall be furnished to the contractor.
(End of Provision)
E.4  VAAR 852.273-74 AWARD WITHOUT EXCHANGES (JAN 2003)
  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without exchanges with offerors. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct exchanges if later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.
(End of Provision)

<DESC>QUESTION:<br />On the first page section 1b, it states that the chamber operates from -40<br />C<br />to +125C. However, on the second page, it states a temperature range of<br />-160C to +200C. Also, it states the use of a cascade system, a cascade<br />system cannot reach -160 C, that I know of. That will require the use of a<br />cryogenic not cascade system. <br />So, should the numbers on page 2 read -60 C and not -160 C. Please address<br />these apparent temperature discrepancies.
<p>ANSWER:<br />Line 1)b. describes the operational range for the TVAC CHAMBER which has a<br />temp range of -40C to +125C. This is the operational range in which we plan<br />to test in.<br />Line 2)a. describes the range for the "Independently controlled Plate"<br />(-160C to +200C), subsystem level. This describes the capabilities of the<br />plate, not the entire system.<br />Line 2)b. describes the range for the "Independently controlled thermal<br />shroud" (-160C to +200C), subsystem level. This describes the capabilities<br />of the shroud, not the entire system.<br />Line 2)c. describes the "cascade" or "circulator" system has a required<br />temperature range of -50C to 200C.</p>

<DESC>This amendment extends the combined synopsis/solicitation due date until 0900 local German time on 14 December 2012.   <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  This contract is for a non-personal service in support of US Army Military Religious Programs. The Contractor must be committed to working within the pluralistic Military Chapel environment, in cooperation with other congregational leaders to meet the needs of the congregation. As a non-personal services contractor, the Catholic Religious Education Coordinator is not a member of the Chapel or Installation Chaplain's Office Staff. The contractor and all employees shall identify themselves as contractor personnel by introducing themselves or being introduced as contractor personnel and displaying distinguishing badges or other visible identification for meetings with Government personnel. The Contractor shall appropriately identify themselves as contractor employees in telephone conversations and in formal and informal written correspondence.  <br>    <br>  The mission of the Chaplain's program is to provide for Essential Elements of Religion to include worship services for all assigned soldiers, civilians, and family members. The primary goal of the religious education program is to provide basic religious understanding through Bible studies, doctrinal studies and life application studies for children, youth and adults within the garrison. All aspects of the religious education program shall remain the responsibility of the Commander and shall be conducted under the supervision of the USAG chaplain. The USAG chaplain will designate a chaplain or chaplains to supervise all chapel religious education programs. The USAG Director or Religious Education (DRE) will advise the chaplain and will provide guidance and direction for program design, curriculum selection, volunteer training and program administration... As such, they fall under the responsibilities of all Chaplains and, here in particular, the Catholic Community Chaplain. The Catholic Religious Education Coordinator falls under the USAG Baumholder Chaplain's Program.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>

<p>(6) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>(8) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>

<DESC>RFP 226264 <br />One C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />November 21, 2012
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (CSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered CSAPRs and the new CSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the transportable CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed at PNNL in Richland, WA.</p>

<DESC>This modification to the Solicitation FORCE XXI BATTLE COMMAND BRIGADE AND BELOW (FBCB2) MOUNTED FAMILY of COMPUTER SYSTEMS (m-FoCS) is to extend the proposal Response Date from 25 September 2012 to 17 October 2012.  Due to the recent questions from industry and variation between the Draft RFP and the Final RFP, the Government feels that such an extension is warranted.  This extension will also impact the Equipment Evaluation by extending the delivery date for each offeror's equipment and materials from 1 October 2012 to 10 October 2012.  <br><br>With regard to solicitation questions posted via the ASFI website, the Government will not respond to questions posted after 24 September 2012, 1630 EDT.  The Government will review all questions and/or comments presented before that deadline; however, the Government reserves the right to respond or not respond to any questions or comments received after 24 September 2012, 1630 EDT. <br><br>The Government posted a Secure Document Package (SDP) to ASFI on 23 August 2012.   The Government has also recently posted a SDP for the drawings called out in Performance Specification paragraph 3.1.2.2 which references the existing JV5 isolator mounts. These SDPs can be accessed under the heading: "m-FoCS Documents" and "m-FoCS Mounts."  Vendors must create a log-in to request access to the SDPs in accordance with the Vendor access instructions at the link below.  In order to obtain access to the SDPs, the Government will require a submission of form DD 2345 and will provide a Non-Disclosure agreement (NDA) to be signed and returned.  This NDA states the following, "The Recipient shall require its employees, subcontractors or suppliers, or prospective subcontractors or suppliers, or vendors (hereinafter referred to as 'Receiving Party or Parties') to sign a Use and Non Disclosure Agreement (U&NDA) prior to disclosing or releasing these Data to such persons or entities."  The Government never provided a sample U&NDA.  Thus, in lieu of a signed U&NDA, the Government is requiring that the Authorized Representative for each offeror, who is signing the NDA for access to the SDP, provide a list of all "Receiving Parties" to the Contract Specialist James.P.Purdy10.civ@mail.mil no later than 24 September 2012, 1630 EDT.  Offerors with access to the SDP posted on 23 August 2012 will be required to request access to the SDP posted with Amendment 0001 of Solicitation W15P7T-12-R-0001 through the ASFI website.  Offerors currently with access to the SDP will not be required to resubmit any documentation with the exception of the above mentioned list of all "Receiving Parties" in order to gain access to the SDP posted with Amendment 0001.<br><br>Vendor access instructions are available at the following link (copy & paste into your url): https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=getstart&mode=list&tab=list&tabmode=list&static=guides<br>

The RFP issued 23 Aug 2012 is the definitive document for the m-FoCS solicitation.  Any documents released prior to this date were issued for informational use only.<br><br>2. The space envelopes for the Basic, Intermediate and Advanced solutions are based upon agreements with the platform Project Managers, reflecting the maximum space claim available for the m-FoCS solution.  These space envelopes are set forth in the 23 Aug 2012 RFP. <br><br>3. The Government will accept hardware for the equipment evaluation that does not conform to the space claim in the specification, provided that the proposal addresses how the offeror intends to meet the requirement.  Equipment Evaluation submissions not meeting the minimum specification requirements will be considered when assessing the maturity of the proposed solution. The fact that equipment may not meet the space claim requirement at the time of the Equipment Evaluation will not be considered as part of the Government's evaluation of the performance of the equipment.<br>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government from an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Requests for solicitation will not receive a response. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division, is seeking potential sources who are interested in the manufacture of 57mm Target Practice (TP) Cartridges.

The ammunition must be suitable for Navy surface ship applications and meet the safety requirements of the U.S. Navy Weapon Systems Explosive Safety Review Board (WSESRB). The cartridge shall be electrically primed and designed to function in the 57mm MK 110 MOD 0 Gun Mount.  The cartridge is intended to be used for target practice firing.  The fixed cartridge shall consist of an inert projectile, a cartridge case with propellant charge, and a primer.

<DESC>(2c) NOTICE - This and all request for information (RFI) and sources sought notice (SSN) postings to-date, for the anticipated CROWS AT requirement, have been for the sole purpose of market research--the gathering of information to help define requirement parameters and formulate a potential acquisition strategy.  The requirement statement/specifications and strategy will likely change, as a result of refinements implemented based upon input received thus far and in the future from all sources.  The Government's final acquisition strategy and requirement specifications (e.g. SOW, test specifications, drawings, etc.), should a solicitation for proposals be issued, will supersede all such documents used during these market research efforts.  An amendment to this posting will be made, as determined by the Government, with information regarding the next anticipated activity associated with the CROWS AT.  No response is required, as a result of this amendment.

All Other Terms and Conditions from the Original Sources Sought posted to FBO on November 9, 2012 Remain unchanged

Questions and Answers that were submitted:
 Q1 - Would a team arrangement as follows, meet the solicitation requirements (Sources Sought Notice VA248-13-R-0174) of SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS, ITEM 2?
a.	Florida registered Fire Protection Engineers for supervision, quality control and engineering judgments.
b.	Life Safety Surveyors, qualified as described by the Joint Commission (Comprehensive Accreditation Manual for Hospitals: The Official Handbook (CAMH) section LS.01.01.01) and meeting all of the other technical selection criteria.
A1 - In accordance with (IAW) with FAR Part 9.601 Definitions Contractor team arrangement, as used in this subpart, means an arrangement in which -
(1)	Two or more companies form a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential prime contractor; or
(2)	A potential prime contractor agrees with one or more other companies to have them act as its subcontractor under a specified Government contract or acquisition program.
If the teaming arrangement described in Q1 meets FAR Part 9.601 and the requirements in Sources Sought Notice VA248-13-R-0174 then the teaming arrangement above would be acceptable.  
Q2 -Will a proposal or even the initial response to this solicitation - be accepted if an application for license by endorsement is in the process?
A2 - If the prime AE firm meets all of the requirements as specified in Sources Sought Notice VA248-13-R-0174 with the exception of not having a Florida Professional Engineer license, proposals would be accepted with the understanding that if selected for award the prime AE as described in Sources Sought Notice VA248-13-R-0174would have a valid Florida Professional Engineer license. 
Q3 - As a small firm that operates in many States, a requirement that the firm's principle must be licensed in any/every state where we provide support to the Federal Government would be extremely cost-prohibitive. Especially since these are Federal Properties, I cannot understand the need for licensure in all states, including Florida. 
A3 - Sources Sought Notice VA248-13-R-0174 does not require the firm's principle to be licensed in all states, but does require the principle in the firm to be a licensed Professional Engineer in the state of Florida.  In addition, please see A2.
IAW FAR Part 36.602-1(a) (5) Selection Criteria.  Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project. 
In order to address the requirement (Location in the geographical area of the project) the Contracting Officer made the decision to limit the location of the prime AE firm to be within a 200 mile radius of the Bay Pines Veteran's Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) located at 10000 Bay Pines Blvd., Bay Pines, FL.
In order to address the requirement (knowledge of the locality of the project) the Contracting Officer made the decision to "require the principle in the firm to be a licensed Professional Engineer in the state of Florida".
Market Research conducted has indicated that there are an appropriate number of qualified firms located within the 200 mile radius of the Bay Pines VAMC.
Q4 - Please clarify that existing VA rules support your requirement that at least two SDVOSB be deemed fully qualified.  If not, agency must begin looking at qualified VOSB firms.  Is this a correction understanding? 
A4 - IAW the Veteran Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 819.7005(c) If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer at a fair and reasonable price from an eligible SDVOSB concern in response to a SDVOSB set aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that concern. If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from eligible SDVOSB concerns, the set aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for VOSB competition.
Q5 - The report requirement under the Scope of Work entails complex and diverse engineering capacity and capability.  Few firms, if any regional SDVOSB or VOSB firms exhibit such characteristics. It is not possible to meet the standard 51% self-perform criteria under such a rigid scope.  I suggest a decrease self-perform obligation up to 20%, as this is mostly consulting engineering not primarily done in house.
A5 - IAW FAR Clause 52.219-14(c) (1) Limitations on Subcontracting. Services (except construction). At least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.
Q6 - We are respectfully requesting that you remove two requirements from the Solicitation, specifically the requirement that the firm be located within 200 miles, and the requirement for the Fire Protection Engineer to be a principal of the firm. 
A6 - Sources Sought Notice VA248-13-R-0174 is revised to reflect the following.  "The prime AE firm shall be located within a 300 mile radius of the Bay Pines VAMC located at 10000 Bay Pines Blvd., Bay Pines, FL. The purpose of increasing the geographical area of the project from 200 miles to a 300 mile radius of the Bay Pines VAMC is to include in full the North Florida/South Georgia Veteran's Health System (Gainesville/Lake City) geographical area of the project. The Fire Protection Engineer does not have to be a principle of the firm.  The principle in the firm must be a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of Florida and shall include a copy of the license in the SF330 package.  Please see RFI A2. Please review Sources Sought Notice VA248-13-R-0174 Submission Requirements paragraph 2.
Q7- This solicitation has a submission requirement limited to (30) pages maximum.  Normally this does not include the SF 330 Part II forms.  Does the (30) page maximum include the SF 330 Part II forms?
A7- The SF330 part I and II are not included in the 30 page max limit.  The technical proposal and any other information provided outside of the SF330 will have a 30 page max limit.
Q8 - Is the 200 mile limit flexible or can it apply the different sites?
A8 - Refer to answer 6 (A6).

<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br />FOR<br />OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>a. Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>Aeronautical Systems Center, Enterprise Acquisition Contracting Division (ASC/PKE)<br />2275 D Street<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7228</p>
<p>POC: Jason Cadek<br />(937) 656-7499<br />E-Mail: Jason.Cadek@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>b. Program Activity: All Air Force (AF) Commands are directed to manage their individual Contracting Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) requirements under AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical Services Management and Control guidelines.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>a. CETS is the medium through which AF units use contractor personnel to provide on-site proficiency training, technical advice and technical assistance when organic skills are not available. The CETS may be acquired to support Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), the Army, the Navy, the Air National Guard (ANG) and possibly the Coast Guard for various weapon systems/subsystems/equipment located at operational AF, ANG, Army, Navy and Coast Guard installations.</p>
<p>b. This Class J&amp;A covers contractual actions for CETS to be awarded for 01 January 2011-31 December 2015. The total estimated number of contracts to be covered for the 5-year period of performance (01 January 2011-31 December 2015) is 10, for an estimated amount of $140.25M. This estimate is based on each Commands' projected CETS requirements, based on historical data, for the 5-year period covered by this Class J&amp;A. Contracts will be awarded and task orders issued only after corresponding requirements have been validated by HQ USAF/ILMM and Commands have issued purchase request packages to ASC/PKESN. The exact number of contracts/task orders and estimated amounts cannot be precisely determined as Commands are continually eliminating and adding CETS representatives, at their respective bases, each year as requirements materialize.</p>
<p>c. The CETS support weapon systems such as F-22 A/C, F-16 A/C, F-15 A/C, KC-135 A/C and A-10 A/C, which is in direct support for the aircrafts in the AFPEO/AC Portfolio. All AF activities that have CETS requirements must submit, on an annual basis, their HAF-ILM (A) 7150 (or its equivalent) to HQ USAF/ILM. This report includes precise narrative justifications for each CETS requirement including a list of the prime contractors. In accordance with AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical Services, HQ USAF/ILMM reviews and validates these requirements on an annual basis. HQ USAF/ILMM maintains these reports.</p>
<p>d. Contracts will generally be awarded during the September-December timeframe prior to the start of each year of performance. The contracts are based on the calendar year with a period of performance beginning 01 January and ending 31 December. All CETS contracts are service contracts, which are requirement contracts, with task orders issued against them. The funding is obligated to each task order issued against the basic contract on a yearly basis. Any CETS contracts that contain AFMC requirements will have a separate Requirements Approval Document (RAD) per contract covering the entire period of performance. All non-Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) requirements will provide the appropriate Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) documents and Determination/Decision Document (DDD). The CETS contracts/task orders utilize fixed price man-month or man-day contracts with cost reimbursement Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for personnel support expenditures such as official travel and in some instances, relocation. All CETS contracts are awarded in accordance with AFI 21-110.</p>
<p>e. CETS is not a typical program managed by ASC. The CETS program is unique because it does not have any Program Managers, Financial Managers, Logisticians or Engineers involved within the CETS contracting organization. Those functions are performed within the requiring activities, not within the CETS Contracting Office.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>a. The AF acquires CETS for specialized on-site technical nonpersonal services that are essential in accomplishing the assigned mission of the equipment and/or weapon systems. The CETS contracts provide a method by which the contractor can provide new/updated information to the using command on new and/or complex equipment and weapon systems in the AF inventory. The CETS contracts also encompass on-the-job training of AF maintenance personnel by employees of the original equipment manufacturers. The CETS representative's main duties consist of the following:<br />&bull; Give on-site technical advice and hands-on training on all aspects of equipment maintenance and operations including modifications and retrofits;<br />&bull; Advise and train on special tools, handling equipment, test equipment and other related items;<br />&bull; Comply with and emphasize safety precautions and comply with Voluntary Protection Program requirements on applicable bases;<br />&bull; Provide maintenance and operational information from the manufacturer;<br />&bull; Assist in mishap investigations and failure data reporting;<br />&bull; Perform direct maintenance only under unusual or emergency circumstances.</p>
<p>b. Air Force Engineering and Technical Services (AFETS) are the primary source of Engineering and Technical Services (ETS) support in the AF. AFETS field engineers are used and retrained as necessary to meet technical needs. CETS is an important element in developing an organic AF capability (insourcing) for its systems. In accordance with AFI 21-110, CETS personnel may not be retained on contract beyond which time AFETS personnel have attained proficiency on assigned systems and can provide the technical assistance associated with CETS support.</p>
<p>c. All of the CETS contractors are original equipment manufacturers (OEM)s. The OEMs have successfully provided engineering and technical support over the past 30 years. The CETS OEMs place highly trained personnel in the field to train AF maintenance teams. The AF personnel continually evaluate, through weapon system and team performance, the quality of service these CETS personnel provide. Since a majority of CETS contracts are follow-on, the technical capabilities of the CETS personnel have already been validated.<br />d. The type of funding that the AF CETS program uses is 3400 appropriations or operations and maintenance funds (O&amp;M). All other services/agencies will provide their appropriate O&amp;M funding. For any CETS Foreign Military Sales (FMS), AFSAC will provide the appropriate funding and will be sole source designated by the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA)/International Agreement Competitive Restrictions (IACR) for individual contracts instead of this Class J&amp;A. <br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition for this class of contract actions is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). In the case of each individual contract, there is only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Under this Class J&amp;A the requirements are deemed to be available only from the original source (OEM) for the continued provision of highly specialized services.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br /><br />a. For each acquisition awarded under the authority of this J&amp;A, the agencies' minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique services available from one source (the OEMs). The OEM contractors possess the necessary proprietary data required to provide on-site CETS technical training. The AF lacks the expert resources and data necessary to establish an organic capability for these services when weapon systems/equipment or modifications thereto are initially fielded. The services are contracted from the manufacturer of the equipment or weapon systems in accordance with the policies and procedures in AFI 21-110. Only OEM CETS supported contracts have the ability to reach any specific expert at any time. Therefore, this acquisition is for continued performance of a highly specialized service.</p>
<p>b. The OEM contractors also provide critical, updated technical data to the CETS representatives in the field. The original technical data is acquired by the government during the initial acquisition of the system/subsystem. At times the technical data is ambiguous and the OEM provides the expertise for interpretation. Furthermore, the expertise of the OEM contractor's research, development, manufacturing and administrative teams, buoyed by the learning curve effect of the manufacturing redesigning, modification and refining process, is not available outside the original equipment manufacturers. Additionally, the OEM contractors are highly trained, possess many years of experience, as well as being certified by the OEM on the different types of equipment that they will be training the AF to use/maintain.</p>
<p>c. Acquisition of engineering drawings from the prime contractor, OEM, is often lengthy and time consuming. Frequently, the OEM contractor can supply the drawings through their CETS representatives within hours, thus enhancing the operating Commands' ability to make a major decision that affects the safe operations of very expensive weapon systems during combat situations. There are times when the ALC will have to go to a manufacturer for drawing support because the center does not have the system knowledge to support a request. Having the CETS representative available eliminates this time consuming procedure and increases the operational readiness of warfighting systems.</p>
<p>d. ASC/PKESN believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the AF's requirements. The OEMs are designated as sole source for CETS provided in support of AF major subdivisions such as AFMC, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air Combat Command (ACC), United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and the ANG. Due to the fact that technical data and expertise are not available except from the OEMs, award to any other source would result in unacceptable and unreliable training for our AF maintenance teams and a critical increase in weapon systems downtime. Based on the reasons stated previously, it is also likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost as a result of required reverse engineering on the different weapon systems/equipment or modifications in order for any other source to provide the required training, which would take numerous years. The process of reverse engineering for each different weapon systems/equipment or modifications would be substantially expensive that it would duplicate previously incurred costs for developing, manufacturing and training individuals so that the company would be able to provide individuals to perform CETS duties. There is not any way to provide an estimate for the duplication cost for the different weapon systems/equipment or modifications for CETS, since the original cost for each of the individual programs are not known to ASC/PKESN. It would be too costly to request the OEMs to research and provide the total costs for each individual program from research and development through production. None of the excess cost for reverse engineering would likely be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements due to the fact that the entire process would be too time consuming.</p>
<p>e. Accordingly, OEMs are the only firms capable of providing the services described in Section III above without the USAF experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE<br /><br />A synopsis was published on 13 August 2009 in the FedBizOpps following coordination with the Small Business Office. No sources have formally responded. A prior synopsis, for the FY 08-FY 10 program, also did not produce any new sources. Individual contract synopses published over the past 6 years have not produced any new qualified sources beyond the OEMs. All CETS basic contracts, that meet the criteria set forth in FAR 5.3, will be synopsized in an individual Notice of Contract Action.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>Fair and reasonable price determination on individual contract actions will be made based upon the results from various tools such as audits, technical evaluations and historical information. The requiring agencies provide a DD255a with each contract requirement which contains an independent government estimate for the calendar year. All proposed program costs will be thoroughly analyzed for each contract action. Contractors will be required to submit cost or pricing data to support the government's evaluation of the proposed price (in accordance with TINA threshold). When an audit is required, the technical evaluations will be provided by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and audit assistance from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). When under the TINA threshold, analysis will be performed by contacting DCAA for recommended rates and factors and by comparison to other PKESN CETS contracts. These methods will provide the contracting officer with adequate knowledge to determine a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>As described previously in Section VI, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties. No inquiries were made regarding the synopsis. Furthermore, market research for CETS over the past 30 years has not generated any successful new sources other than the OEMs.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>a. ASC/PKESN experience has been that the various commands that CETS supports have contracted for Interim Contract Support (ICS) CETS personnel to support the USAF because the new systems are so intensive with computer driven devices that hardware/software changes and technical data are late-to-need. The manufacturer normally has the task of maintaining the technical data/software baseline for the USAF. Until the total engineering support is transferred to the responsible Air Logistics Center (ALC), the manufacturer has the only master file of current technical data.<br />b. There are many components and hardware support items that are coded weapon system peculiar. The manufacturer has the specification data to cross-reference these items and provide alternative part numbers and specification numbers that can be substituted for installation on a component. As the weapon system matures, the AF develops the cross-reference tables at the ALCs and provides adequate support. This support is critical until in-house capabilities are developed.</p>
<p>c. Procurement of engineering drawings from the prime contractor (OEM) is often lengthy and time consuming. Frequently, the OEM contractor can supply the drawings through their CETS representatives within hours, thus enhancing the operating Commands' ability to make a major decision that affects the safe operations of very expensive weapon systems during combat situations. There are times when the ALC will have to go to a manufacturer for drawing support because the Center does not have the workforce to support a request. Having the CETS representative available eliminates this time consuming procedure and increases the operational rate of warfighting systems.</p>
<p>d. The Commands' statements of work will define all requirements to deliver a full-up operational weapons system to a combat unit. Frequently during the process of production, modifications/changes are made that affect the end product causing a shortfall in technical data, software and hardware for subsystems when the initial system is fielded. The CETS representatives are often the only link between and operating unit and the company to solve the problem.</p>
<p>e. The minimum needs of the government for data and data rights have been determined according to DFARS 227.71. No technical data will be purchased or generated by contracts awarded under the authority of this J&amp;A. Only services and related travel support costs, as defined and approved under the procedures set forth in AFI 21-110, can be purchased under the authority of this J&amp;A.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>See Section VI above.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>The expertise required to provide CETS on a specified piece of equipment or weapon system is not normally available from other than the prime manufacturer. As the equipment/weapon system remains in the AF inventory, the possibility of the AF having trained personnel experienced on the contractor's equipment increases. This organic capability will result in the contracted services being eliminated. Other than organic capability, obtaining open competition is not practical due to the constant changes in the equipment/weapon system and lack of updated technical data being readily available.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The contracting officer's signature on the coordination and approval document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>As CETS support extends to multiple platforms and multiple users contracted through ASC/PKESN, per AFI 21-110, there is not a single POC for technical/requirements. Each using activity provides their requirements to ASC/PKESN through a DD255a per the AFI. As evidenced by his/her signature on the coordination and approval document, the Contracting Officer acting as the coordinator for all program managers has certified that any supporting data contained herein which is the using activities responsibility is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO PROCURE ITEM PECULIAR TO ONE MANUFACTURER (See FAR 11.105(a)(3)).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Education, Office of Communications and Outreach (the Department), intends to solicit, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 19.8, InquisIT, LLC, 14701 C Willard Road, Chantilly, VA  20151, for provision of Parature Enterprise software (Parature) products and services.  InquisIT, LLC is an authorized Parature reseller.  The procurement will be conducted using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).</p>
<p>The Department has a need for web-based, IPv6-compliant software to operate an eService Center.  The eService Center is a web-based customer relationship management application that provides online access to searchable, frequently asked questions, and enables the Department's customers to receive information and resources more efficiently and at a greater speed. In addition, much of the labor-intensive process for managing written inquiries, including reporting on customer knowledge and monitoring staff activities, is automated through the eService Center to improve the efficiency of the Center.</p>
<p>Market research for this SAP action determined that Parature was the only web-based, IPv6-compliant software reasonably available to meet the Department's need.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to meet the requirement in writing to the identified point of contact not later than December 14, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely to determine whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Department not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Department. This notice of intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
