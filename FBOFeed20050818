<DESC>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center plans to issue a Request for Proposal for Full Cost Consultation Services in support of GSFC’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Code 150. This requirement necessitates in-depth knowledge and understanding of the approach and policies for full cost accounting.  This knowledge and understanding is essential to ensure that future efforts align with previously established procedures.  The vendor must possess the unique knowledge, skills and ability to facilitate the GSFC's approach to full cost accounting. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase these services from Fred C. McNutt.  The authority for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Mr. McNutt is uniquely qualified to provide the required service.  Mr. McNutt has an extensive background and knowledge from years of operating in an industry business environment.	He was intimately involved with effective business processes and approaches used in a competitive business corporate environment and has the relevant experiences GSFC is seeking.  As Chief Financial Officer for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory he was involved in the development of NASA's policies and approach for full cost from the conceptual and early design phases through the transition to the full cost environment and therefore posses a unique knowledge of the Agency's approach to full cost.  Mr. McNutt participated in GSFC's redirection of planned approaches and procedures for full cost and therefore has experience in reviewing and recommending changes to GSFC's full cost approach and has established working relationships with several key GSFC full cost participants.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 2, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL: http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<ARCHDATE>09242005
<CONTACT>Elisa Brown, 202-385-8397
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's decision to award a modification to extend the current Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) contract.  The period of performance is for a base period of nine (9) months with a one (1) three month option period.  DUATS, a configuration item of the National Airspace System (NAS) modernization program is a weather briefing and flight plan service for pilots. It is projected that the FS-21, to be deployed at the AFSS's by Lockheed Martin (LM) will not support the DUATS requirements until the February 2006 time frame.  Sufficient time of at least four to five months would also have to be allowed after February to accommodate a smooth transition.  Administrative and technical costs would be incurred if a full and open competition were conducted.  Costs far out weigh any benefits that would be derived from a competition.  Even if it were possible to award a full and open competition by October 1, 2005, it would not be cost effective, since the period of performance would only be for a period of six (6) months (February 2006, when FS-21 will support the DUATS requirements).  Given these circumstances, a full and open competition is not prudent. Therefore, the agency intends to extend the DUATS contracts with the current two service providers - CSC Information Systems, LLC (CSC) and Data Transformation Corporation (DTC) until June 30, 2006 with an option to extend performance an additional three (3) months, or until September 30, 2006.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05.  The contract shall provide the VA Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) with quantity one (1) system:  Autopol V Polarimeter including installation and training.  This is an instrument that is used for unattended automatic measuring the optical rotation of specific compounds and is specifically designed for GLP/cGMP laboratories.

This is the only polarimeter with this feature and is important for the QC/QA of the Center’s standards.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest to the Contracting Officer no later than 1400 Mountain Standard Time, August 25, 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete the action based on responses is solely within the Government’s discretion. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive proposal.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of NMVAHCS.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (505) 248-3206.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Seascan for a digital refit to upgrade analog Multiple Opening and Closing Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) mounted video plankton recorder (VPR) system to digital components.  MOCNESS, a set of sequentially opening plankton nets of different sizes with environmental sensors to record depth, temperature, and other water conditions, is used by scientists to study the distribution of ocean animals such as copepods and other small animals less than 5mm in length.  The computer replacing the analog video tape recorders requires a much smaller underwater casing reducing the size and weight of the MOCNESS.  The new software will allow plankton identification to be completed in real time.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334419.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  Seascan designed and manufactured the current analog VPR system and has been involved with the VPR development for over 10 years.  Seascan is the only authorized distributor of the plankton auto identification program.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to provide comparable and compatible equipment by August 31, 2005. No other information will be provided.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. Capability statements and supporting documentation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain a system that will provide Air Force aircrew members protection against laser devices/systems in combat, in military operations other than war, and in training situations while minimizing visual performance degradation.  Aircrews will employ the ALEP Block 2 whenever laser devices (e.g., weapons, rangefinders, and designators) are likely to be employed by US, Allied, or unfriendly forces.  ALEP Block 2 will protect against invisible and visible laser wavelengths from both threats and hazardous equipment.  ALEP Block 2 must also be compatible with aircrew life support equipment (LSE) and provide prescription capability.  Multiple ALEP devices may be required because of the challenges imposed by laser protection versus luminous transmittance challenges, or because of the limitations due to LSE physical compatibility challenges.   When the technology allows, the protection offered by the ALEP Block 2 will be changed during production upon notification by HQ ACC/XO of an emerging threat.  When the technology allows, the production process should allow the capability for changes in the wavelength protection of ALEP Block 2 to counter an emerging threat as determined by HQ ACC/XO.

The ALEP Block 2 program is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.  The Air Force’s acquisition strategy is to enter into Full and Open Competition for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase(s).  The RFP includes two documents that are not approved for public release:  the ALEP Block 2 Performance Specification (PS) Classified Annex and the ALEP Security Classification Guide (SCG).  The information in these documents is essential for proposal preparation/submittal.

As cited in the FedBzOps Notice each offeror must submit their CAGE code Code and classified fax number for security verification.  If classified fax number is not available, please provide a classified mailing address.

The release of the two documents mentioned above will require two actions: (1) Verification by Defense Security Services of your company’s security status (any offerors who have not submitted their CAGE Code and classified fax number/mailing address previously must submit this information ASAP); and (2) Official request of these documents shall be submitted to the contracting officer via email to annabel.rivera@brooks.af.mil.

All offerors must complete the Business Management questionnaire in Section L of solicitation document with three references.   References must be for SAME OR SIMILAR ITEMS.  All offerors shall complete the ACH form, which can be found on UNICOR’s webpage.  A completed ACH form must be on file prior to contract award as well as verification of registration in the CCR database.  If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Offerors can obtain a copy of the ACH form by logging onto www.unicor.gov, Business Commercial Opportunities, Navigate to, Scroll down to Procurement forms, click on ACH Form, print and return completed form with written proposal.  Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Section K, Representations and certifications by logging onto http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process .   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all times.   ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent  information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Specification,  Past Performance and Price.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  The solicitation will be available on UNICOR’s website at www.unicor.gov and eps.gov on or about August 22, 2005.  No copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  All responsible offerors may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<DESC>This is a combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.       This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     The solicitation number is HSCEAM-05-R-00038, which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).     This requirement is UNRESTRICTED acquisition.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.


The proposed ranges must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:

       As set forth in the section entitled, Location and Schedule Requirements, the range must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the time indicated.     

       The range may be indoors or outdoors and shall possess a minimum of ten (10) firing points with compressor and small generator.     An indoor range shall possess air conditioning, heating, and approved ventilation system in conformance with existing OSHA standards.  The contractor is reminded that in accordance with subparagraph (q) of FAR clause 52.212-4, “Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items,” the contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this contract for range services.

       The range shall be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards. There shall be firing lines at the 1.5, 3, 7, 15 and 25 yard lines.

       The range shall possess moveable barricades for the 15 and 25-yard line course of fire.     The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it. (Example: wood).     For outdoor ranges the berms must be of sufficient depth so that rounds cannot penetrate or “shoot through” the berm.  The berms must be of sufficient height to prevent rounds from exiting the range during normal course of fire.  The berms shall be maintained to provide a safe shooting environment at all times when utilized by DHS personnel. For indoor ranges the backstop/bullet trap must be maintained to provide a safe shooting environment as well.  All equipment associated with an indoor range must be in good working order and functional during course of fire (ie., pulley, target system, lighting, etc.)

       The range shall possess a public address system available during firearms training.

       The range shall possess some type of ON-SITE classroom/instructional facility with marking board and/or chalkboard, and seating for a minimum of 25 students.     If an on-site classroom is not available, a covered or enclosed area with seating for a minimum of 25 students, free from the elements, must be available for instructional purposes. 

       The range shall possess a secure storage area dedicated exclusively to DHS under the resultant contract.     This secure storage area shall be capable of storing at least 5000 rounds of pistol ammunition; 100 cardboard type target backers and targets; a portable stand-up 20-gallon compressor and a 12 position portable turning target system AND SMALL GENERATOR.

       The range shall be equipped with men and WOMENS restroom facilities with running water.  NOTE:  PORTACANS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE.

       The range shall possess an area in which to clean weapons. This area shall be equipped with sufficient countertop/tabletop space for multiple users at one time. 

The range shall provide sufficient trash receptacles for used targets, target backers, and empty ammunition boxes.

       The range shall be able to accommodate the following calibers:     .357 SIG, 9mm Luger, and .40.

       The range shall possess adequate parking to accommodate a minimum of 15 vehicles.

       The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms at firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions).     The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster or from concealment.     The ranges rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where student/ instructor ratio would be too restrictive).     The range rules shall allow shooters to utilize weapons on fully automatic during drills.

       The estimated number days for range usage per quarter is 24 days.     The estimated number of rounds fired is 175,000 per quarter.



       
LOCATION AND SCHEDULE REQUIREMENTS

The range must be closed or concealed from the public during the corresponding hours.

Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range from 0800 to 1630 hours, a minimum of 8 days a month with one segment in a block of 5 consecutive days.     This does not include weekends or holidays, however, there may occasionally be circumstances wherein a day of a weekend may be needed. 

Should weather (i.e., rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS will have priority in re-scheduling those missed days within the same month if possible, or the following month if not possible.       

       The range shall be within a 75 minute commute of Highway 290 and Beltway 8.     The 75-minute commute will be assessed in consideration of prime, rush hour traffic in both the morning and late afternoon/early evening.

<DESC>N00244 Naval Base 937 North Harbor Drive San Diego, CA Laura Maxwell 619-532-2365 This is published as a sole source announcement under the authority of the test program for commercial items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  The proposed contract action is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to the authority FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii).   See Note 22.  The NAICS code for this action is 334510. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source contract to N’Spine Monitoring to provide neurophysiologic monitoring services for the Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).  The vendor must have the ability to deliver the required products with 1 to 2 hours for acute trauma (24 hours per day/ 7 days a week).  The vendor will deliver standard replenishment requirements in 1 to 2 business days, unless specified otherwise.  A consultant will be available 24 hours per day/ 7 days a week for technical assistance, pre, peri, and post-operatively.  Quarterly in-services/ updates shall be provided for surgical staff.  Contractor must be in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) regulations.  Invoicing must be on a 30-day billing cycle and must be received by the orthopedic department within 5-10 working days of the following month.   N’Spine Monitoring is the only known contractor in the San Diego area that can perform the specialized neurophysiologic monitoring, and can meet the NMCSD’s urgent delivery requirements.  N’ Spine Monitoring services provides a comprehensive approach to neuromonitoring by providing circumferential analysis of cord function through a multi-modality approach.  This comprehensive approach includes upper and lower extremity Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP), Transcranial Motor Evoked Potential (TCMEP), EMG (free Running and Triggered), Facial Nerve Monitoring and Auditory Brainstem Evoked Potentials (ABR).  The surgeons at the NMCSD are familiar with the N’Spine Monitoring system, and any change in vendor for this requirement would impose added costs for training, and might ultimately compromise the health and safety of the patients. The proposed contract is for a base period of one year, from 1 October 2005 through 30 September 2006, with 4 one-year option periods to follow.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, and provide evidence of HIPAA compliance, CLIA certification and CAP accreditation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all statements of interest and capability received no later than 30 August 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All statements of interest/capability documentation must be submitted via email attachment or fax to the attention of Ms. Laura Maxwell at 619-532-4957.  Mailed documents ! will not be accepted.  All questions pertaining to this synopsis shall be submitted by e-mail only.

The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source contract to All Fresh Products, Inc. to supply specialty food items to the Galley for Inpatient Division at for the Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).  The physicians at the NMCSD rely on these nutritional supplies, many of them low sodium or low calorie, to meet the needs of patient treatment plans.

The proposed contract is for a base period of one year, from 1 October 2005 through 30 September 2006, with 4 one-year option periods to follow.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, and provide evidence of compliance with all safety & HACCP guidelines.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures stated in FAR Part 13. 

The Surveillance Research Program at NCI is currently in the process of developing a survival query system for clinicians. The motivation for this system is to make the rich resources of the SEER survival data more accessible to both clinicians and patients and members of their staff hold patents for nomograms to aid in the treatment decision of prostate cancer, and to help patients better understand their chance of dying from their cancer and from causes other than their cancer. This system augments the more standard survival measure of relative survival by assessing the general health status of the patient and quantifying the contribution of other-cause mortality conditioned on an individual’s current health status. The purpose of this contract is to 1) Assess the discriminatory power of the current version of the survival query system for clinicians to predict those at higher risk of dying from cancer; 2) Quantify the added benefit of including co morbidity information in the survival system; 3) Investigate the need for additional modeling.  

The Cleveland Clinic Foundation is uniquely qualified to perform the services stated above. The Cleveland Clinic is a leader in the development of computerized approaches designed to more accurately predict how a specific illness affects patients. The Cleveland Clinic and its staff are one of the leading facilities in the world on development, validation and use of prediction models.
The Cleveland Clinic Foundation is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the expertise and extensive experience in developing and validating the predictions associated with this project.     

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, and has the support of the above listed partners, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on September 2, 2005.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or sent via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors’ responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to insure all questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  
In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Boston Micromachines Corp (BMC)in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Our team has been working with the vendor to advance the use of the critical MEMS based deformable mirror technology for this mission.  The BMC technology for the deformable mirrors is the only technology which uses a multi-faceted (non-continuous) deformable mirror surface with control of piston, tip and tilt for each of the separate facets.  This technology is required to develop the GSFC VNC laboratory test bed and the test bed design is predicated around this technology.  Any other vendors deformable mirror technology would require a completely new mission concept and a re-design of the laboratory test bed which is not cost effective and is time consuming. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. est. on the closing date above.

<DESC>The National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Ann Arbor, Michigan seeks an experienced vendor to upgrade one of our existing Light Duty Vehicle (LDV) 48? single roll electric dynamometers, which were installed by Horiba Instruments in 1992-96. The vendor shall provide the two essential components of this retrofit - the physical hardware and software changes and the expertise to engineer, install, calibrate, and verify the complete system.  The physical changes involve a new AC flux vectored power converter and drive to enable higher horsepower capability.   The existing motor, load cell, rolls, and all mechanical components of the LDV-48? machine will be retained, but the upgraded system will require new calibration and parameter changes to adjust the response tuning after the electrical power upgrade. The subsystems shall be installed and integrated with the existing Horiba RTM-200 microcomputer and CDC 900 controller systems that control the performance of the dynamometer. Any parameter or software changes shall be completed by the vendor and the performance of the overall system shall be verified by an acceptance test procedure. The North American Industry Classification Code is 334513 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  A written solicitation, PR-CI-05-10719, is anticipated to be issued on Wednesday 5/04/05.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued as a request for proposals (RFP).

<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@ustda.gov
<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. M. Dagva, Director General, Mongolian Civil Aviation Authority Buyant-Ukhaa Airport, Ulaanbaatar – 34, Mongolia, Phone:(976-11) 313-151, 982-001, Fax: (976-11) 313-151, 379-640. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance on the implementation of needed improvements in Mongolia’s air traffic management.  

In Mongolia, rising levels of air traffic and underdeveloped aviation infrastructure are creating an urgent need for the aviation sector to upgrade communications, navigation, and surveillance systems, and air traffic management (CNS/ATM) capabilities. Mongolia’s air traffic is growing at 5 percent to 10 percent per year and has now reached up to 110 flights per day during peak periods.   More specifically, the international traffic over the skies of Mongolia en route to destinations in China and Russia has increased significantly, with China now representing 59 percent of its over-flight volume.  Monitoring air traffic volume effectively is both a safety issue, in ensuring adequate airspace capacity to minimize the risk of accidents, and a financial issue, as international over-flights produce revenue through fees and charges to international air carriers.  

The Monglian Civil Aviation Authority (MCAA), operating under the Ministry of Roads, Transport, and Tourism, is the agency responsible for providing air traffic services, operating airports, setting safety standards and their oversight, and regulating the sector overall.  The MCAA’s existing CNS/ATM system, the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Contract system, requires aircraft to be fitted with expensive avionics equipment in order to interface with the system, and has proven to be neither cost-effective nor appealing to the aviation sector.  In the MCAA’s 2003 Civil Aviation Master Plan funded by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the current system was identified as insufficient to cope with the anticipated future traffic growth over Mongolian airspace.   

As a result, MCAA is currently considering alternative solutions based on Autonomic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technologies for upgrading its existing aviation system. The advantages of an ADS-B Mode S based system include lower costs associated with avionics installation, easier interface, more accurate surveillance data providing increased air traffic capacity, broader scope of data transmission, and greater support for new application add-ons. Currently there are three types of datalink standards associated with ADS-B systems: (i) Mode S “extended squitter”, (ii) VDL Mode 4, and (iii) Universal Access Transceiver. The Mongolians have made some trial tests of VDL Mode 4, which is more widely promoted in Europe, and are considering utilization of this datalink standard for its domestic flight traffic control. However, for its more important international routes, the MCAA is interested in learning more about the Mode S standard, which is endorsed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Agency. 

In order to support the ADS-B Mode S system, MCAA is requesting expert technical assistance to assist it in planning and procuring a pilot system to test the system’s functionality and effectiveness for international air traffic.   The Definitional Mission review of this project proposes that U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) fund a Technical Assistance contractor to work with MCAA in developing an implementation plan, preparing specifications and the tender package for procurement of a pilot system of two ground stations and related equipment, and assisting in tender implementation and evaluation. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $100,051grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 10:00, SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center is the clinical research facility of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Clinical Center provides patient care, services, training and the environment in which NIH clinicians-scientists creatively translate emerging knowledge into better understanding, detection, treatment and prevention of human disease. The Office of Financial Resources Management (OFRM), CC provides efficient and effective financial management of programs that fully support the CC and the NIH in meeting its goals and objectives. OFRM is responsible for managing all of the CC financial operations to include developing and monitoring the annual hospital operating budget; identifying Institute cost and volume utilization information; developing impact assessments for new protocols and initiatives; performing financial and workload audit and control functions; defining business requirements for new clinical information systems and supporting modules that document and monitor patient care. To assist in achieving its goal, OFRM began the design and development of a hospital Executive Information System (EIS) to allow participating NIH Institutes the ability to quickly access and analyze information across a broad range of hospital functions. The initial phase of the EIS initiative was to develop patient census dashboards for hospital and IC leadership. Each dashboard contains hospital patient statistics including inpatient and outpatient census, admissions, average daily census, etc. This was achieved in January 2004. Simultaneously, development was started and implemented in April 2004 for the creation of a hospital executive dashboard with key organization performance indicators including financial, human resources, patient safety, compliance and accessibility. The contractor shall provide all labor, design, tools, equipment, material and other items and services necessary for EIS Enhancements, Development, and Training. It is expected that this Request for Quote and the NAICS code for this requirement is 541511. The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract for a four month performance period.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the Regents of the University of California, Center for Health Policy and Public Health Institute, Los Angeles, CA  90095 for analyses of California Health Interview Survey-Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CHIS-CAM) data to explore the impact of ethnic and racial status, acculturation, and other socio-demographic factors on CAM utilization and resistance to acknowledging CAM use to physicians.  The Center for Health Policy Research at the University of California at Los Angeles, conducted a series of surveys examining health behaviors in California.  These include the 2000 California Health Interview Survey-Cancer Control Topical Module (2000 CHIS-CCTM), the California Health Interview Survey in 2001(CHIS 2001) and the California Health Interview Survey-Complimentary and Alternative Medicine (CHIS-CAM) in 2002.  CHIS-CAM, a follow-back study to targeted individuals who responded to the CHIS Adult core survey, collected extensive information on CAM use among those with cancer, non-cancer, and chronic illnesses other than cancer, to compare and contrast this usage with that of the general population.  The study collected data from 9,187 people (2,071 had cancer) who agreed to be re-contacted from CHIS-2001.  The purpose of this project is to analyze key issues of interest to the NCI within CHIS-CAM data.  The first will address utilization of “ethnic specific” CAM modalities as opposed to other CAM modalities by Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans.  The second will address resistance to the disclosure of CAM use to physicians among those with cancer and other chronic conditions.  The third will examine how such resistance is related to demographics, socioeconomic status, health care access and use, and cultural characteristics.  Analyses of these data is crucial, as the size and diversity of the racial/ethnic groups in the CHIS-CAM sample will help NCI to ascertain use of CAM among racial/ethnic minority populations that are insufficiently represented in current national surveys.  The work to be carried out under this project will require that analyses be conducted using a data set that combines variables from two separate studies: CHIS 2001 and CHIS-CAM.  The University of California, School of Public Health, Los Angeles designed and collected the CHIS-CAM study as well as the CHIS 2001 study and they are the only organization that has the data that is required for this study.   The University of California at Los Angeles is the only known source to the NCI Researcher  who has the data to complete this project. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 1, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Description
CMS intends to award a 23-month fixed cost contract, with no options, to a small business to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid Error Rate (MER) project.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  
BACKGROUND: CMS must estimate improper payments in the Medicaid program as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress.  
The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.
To implement error rate measurement in Medicaid, CMS will use a national contracting strategy.  Under this strategy, CMS will engage three contractors: (1) a statistical contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 4, 2005); (2) a documentation/database contractor (posted to Fedbizopps.gov August 10, 2005); and (3) a review contractor.  The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions.  The documentation/database contractor will gather medical policies and other necessary information from states; will maintain a database of the medical policies (along with quarterly updates to these policies) and will gather medical records from providers.  All information collected by the documentation/database contractor will be maintained in electronic format.  The review contractor will use the policies and medical records obtained by the documentation/database contractor to perform the medical reviews, provide findings to the statistical contractor, jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor and submit the report to CMS.
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: The successful offeror, as the review contractor, shall make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical reviews.  The review contractor shall review each sampling unit to determine if was processed through the claims payment system correctly, medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied.  The review contractor shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the sampling unit, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies.  The review contractor shall conduct the data processing reviews on-site for each state selected, visiting each state between two and five times.  The medical reviews may be performed at a central location.
The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit, a hospital stay, a month of enrollment in Medicare).  The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. It is estimated that between 800 – 1200 sampling units or an average of 1000, per state, will need to be reviewed to achieve 3% precision at the 95% confidence level. The contractor shall perform this work for one complete production, December 31, 2005, through November 30, 2007.  This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal late August 2005 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>HRVHMM Pre-Solicitation Notice

This is a pre-solicitation notice for the Strike-Up/Strike-Down (SUSD) Program.  ATI, in its role supporting the Office of Naval Research’s Seabasing Future Naval Capability, anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the very near future in support of the Shipboard Internal Cargo Movement Program, referred to as Strike-Up/Strike-Down (SUSD).  The SUSD Program has a need for technologies to enable the seamless end-to-end internal shipboard movement of material (various sized cargo, packages, pallets and weapons) onboard a variety of naval vessels.  The anticipated RFP will cover Phase I of the Science and Technology (S&T) development of the automated horizontal to vertical to horizontal transition portion of an end-to-end internal shipboard material movement system.  This pre-solicitation notice and other information is available at www.nsrp.org/seabasing/susd.html
	
The funding anticipated for Phase I of the project will be limited to a maximum of $350,000.00 for each awardee.  It is anticipated two to three Phase I proposals may be funded with a down-select to one following the completion of the initial six-month Phase I effort.  The anticipated period of performance for Phase I is six (6) months from contract award date, which is anticipated to be in December 2005.  The complete project inclusive of options is anticipated to be four years or less in length.  The SUSD Program reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to a formal RFP.

The goal of this pre-solicitation notice is to provide potential responders ample time in which to begin exploring potential teaming opportunities.  A list of potential responders will be maintained at www.nsrp.org/seabasing/susd.html.  Interested parties may request inclusion on the potential responders list by e-mailing their point of contact information along with their area of interest to Marcia Lytton at lytton@aticorp.org.

ATI anticipates conducting a half-day HRVHMM Proposers’ Conference in Charleston, SC within two weeks following RFP issuance.  Participants will have the opportunity to learn about HRVHMM requirements, operating concerns and objectives, and SUSD solicitation package preparation.  At the discretion of attendees, informal discussions may be conducted to explore potential collaborative partnerships.  Complete details including the actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The effort involves the development of an Integrated Emergency Operations Center (IEOC) Program.

The contract will be awarded on  a sole source basis to Mountain Top Technologies (MTT), 647 Main Street, Ste.  310, Johnstown, Pa.   This effort is a follow-on to a Penn State University  task under contract W15QKN-04-D-1012.  The rationale for sole source to MTT is  that the cost to replicate capabilities is estimated to be in excess of $5M and  a program slippage of approximately eighteen (18) months.

<DESC>The proposed simplified acquisition listed herein is a 100 percent Small Business Set-Aside.  The NAICS code is 541611.  The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management has issued a Request for Quote (RFQ) for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Office of Policy, Planning and Budget (OPPB) to provide assistance and support for the OPPB on various agency-wide extramural policy and grant planning activities.  The anticipated period of performance shall be seven (7) months.  Only electronic copies of the solicitation will be available.  Quotes are due by August 29, 2005.

TITLE:

Support for Extramural Policy/Grant Planning Activities

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	

September 1, 2005 – April 28, 2006

PURPOSE:  

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide assistance and support for the Office of Policy, Planning and Budget (OPPB) on various agency-wide extramural policy and grant planning activities.  This arrangement will enhance the ability of OPPB to address, coordinate, and implement these activities in a timely and effective manner.

SCOPE OF WORK: 

In completing this purchase order, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks: (1) review and update up to four to 6 SAMHSA Instruction and Information documents (I & I), converting them to SAMHSA Extramural Policy Statements (SEPS); (2) review and update the SAMHSA National Advisory Council (NAC) Handbook; and (3) establish a process for expeditiously posting grant announcements and their respective synopsis on the SAMHSA web page and on http://www.grants.gov.

Task 1:  Review and Update up to four to 6 SAMHSA Instruction and Information Documents (I & I).  

Instruction and Information (I & I) memoranda are policy papers produced by SAMHSA in the late 1990s, several of which are now out of date. The Government Project Officer (GPO) will identify four to 6 I & Is that are a priority for the contractor to revise and update. The contractor shall research changes that have occurred in Agency policy since these I & Is were developed, as well as any new Department policies and laws that are relevant. The contractor shall be expected to discuss issues with staff across the Agency to explore all factors pertaining to these I & Is, as well as possible resolutions. The contractor also shall develop the documents in the new title and format for SAMHSA policy papers, which are known now as SAMHSA Extramural Policy Statements (SEPS).  

Task 2:  Update the SAMHSA National Advisory Council Manual. 

SAMHSA staff are responsible for administering the work of six National Advisory Councils/Committees. Each group is responsible for advising the Agency.  All three SAMHSA Centers’ Advisory Council members also are involved in the second level of SAMHSA’s dual review system.  Each council/committee is expected to carry out various responsibilities while adhering to specific policies and regulations pertaining to their work.  OPPB is responsible for ensuring that members across these bodies are provided consistent information regarding their function, role, and responsibilities, especially in relation to various statutes (e.g., Federal Advisory Committee Act, Privacy Act, and the Government in Sunshine Act).  The NAC Handbook is the primary document that is used to convey this information in a consistent manner.  To address changes that have been made, the contractor shall review changed policies/practices and meet with various staff to gather updated information and use that material, as appropriate, to revise the NAC Handbook.

Task 3:  Review/Refine Process for Posting SAMHSA Grant Announcements.  

Beginning in FY 2005, all Federal agencies were required to post grant announcements on http://www.grants.gov, a web site that serves as a single source for identifying and applying for government-wide competitive grant opportunities.  This web site provides a synopsis of each funding opportunity as well as pertinent information that must be used to successfully apply for the grant. To adhere to the new requirement, it is necessary for SAMHSA to establish a process that ensures timely and accurate posting of these documents.   The contractor shall convene meetings with SAMHSA staff and review the processes that are currently being used to carry out these tasks.  The contractor shall recommend revisions/refinements to the process that result in timely posting of grant announcements on the SAMHSA website and synopsis that accurately reflect the intent of the program on http://www.grants.gov.  The recommended process must take into account the need for backup support to assist, when needed, with posting the documents.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
I.  PURPOSE
The Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) is seeking sources for a possible future acquisition. This RFI solicits the contractors’ interest and capability to meet stated objectives, and is for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Respondents to this RFI will form the basis of a selected bidders list concerning any subsequent PM ISE RFP actions relevant to Electronic Directory Services or the functional equivalent.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997):
1.	The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs of the FAR.
2.	Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.
3.	This solicitation is issued for the purpose of determining interested contractors for the proposed ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) acquisition.
This RFI serves two purposes: 1) to inform the Government on the type and scope of work expected; and, 2) to receive information and feedback on interest and capabilities of potential sources. We request that contractors replying to this RFI provide a response to each of the questions listed in Section III.
II. BACKGROUND
The intent of this RFI is, consistent with the direction in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004, to provide Electronic Directory Services (EDS), or the functional equivalent, to enable authorized participants to locate and access information, organizations, services and personnel in support of their respective mission requirements for terrorism information. Recognizing that successful counterterrorism efforts require an effective information sharing capability, section 1016 of the IRTPA requires creation of an information sharing environment (ISE) for counterterrorism information in a manner consistent with national security and the information privacy and other legal rights of Americans. In accordance with the INTELLIGENCE REFORM AND TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT (IRTPA), the INFORMATION SHARING ENVIRONMENT (ISE) will reflect the combination of policies, procedures, and technologies linking the resources of the Federal, State, local and tribal governments, the private sector, and foreign allies, to facilitate information sharing, access, and collaboration among users to combat terrorism effectively. The ISE will support the sharing and access to terrorism information, which includes information from the intelligence, law enforcement, military, homeland security and other communities. Section 1016 further specifies that the ISE will have an ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) capability or the functional equivalent.
The ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) is intended to enable authorized users, including operators, analysts, responders, planners and policy makers, to locate and access information, organizations, services and personnel in support of their respective mission requirements. This includes finding experts and possible collaboration partners.  Therefore, this RFI is intended to seek ideas from the broadest possible audience to meet the needs of each of the users of the EDS. Responses should describe what the EDS capability will look like as it matures, identify an initial capability that could be established in the short term (30-60 days), and what a phased approach would provide for a mid- and long-term expansion (1 and 3 years, respectively). An initial capability must at a minimum, contain terrorism information and be accessible to the Federal government with a clear path for early expansion to State, local, and tribal officials, law enforcement, the private sector, and foreign allies. The rough order of magnitude capacity of the ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) for the long term is thousands of organizations and, potentially, millions of individual users, and hundreds of thousand or millions of accesses each day.
III. RFI QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSE
Based on information provided in response to this RFI, the PM INFORMATION SHARING ENVIRONMENT (ISE) will determine the potential offeror’s capability to perform functions as described in this RFI.  Respond in the provided Question/Answer format for each question in the RFI Questionnaire section.  The Government recognizes that many potential offerors will only have information pertaining to a portion of this RFI.  However, this limited “best of breed” information could still be of high quality and significant value to the ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) initiative. Therefore, while the government seeks an EDS solution, it does not discourage partial responses. If you choose not to respond to a question, indicate “no response” and indicate the rationale.  No more than 20 total single-sided pages with print no smaller than 12 point is suggested; however, text included in graphics, tables, and figures can be smaller than 10 point. The submissions must be in sufficient detail and clarity to provide the information needed to assess your solution approach.  Marketing material and reference material may be placed in appendices.  Responses must be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 or later.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from potential offerors.

Question 1. Is this solicitation open to foreign (Australian) registered companies or to U.S. registered but foreign owned companies? Does the fact that the US & Australia signed a Free Trade Agreement in early 2005 have any bearing on the above situation?

Answer 1. DFARS 252.225-7021 TRADE AGREEMENTS states that Australia is a “Designated Country” and a “Free Trade Agreement Country”. The clause further states that offers for “Designated Country end products” be treated as though they were U.S.-made. “Designated Country end products” include “Free Trade Agreement end products” which are those grown, produced or manufactured in a “Free Trade Agreement Country” or have been substantially transformed in a “Free Trade Agreement Country”. See the DFAR cite for the exact language.
Question 2. Is NRL “expecting” this SWIR imager to built from COTS items much like the PHILLS II sensor? Your six month delivery schedule would either suggest that or that there was already a vendor with the right item essentially “ex stock”?

Answer 2. NRL does not have a preferred method for responding to the solicitation. However, our understanding of the state of the art in this field suggests that integration of COTS components, or alternatively the manufacture of a “stock” item, represents viable ways to respond to the solicitation.

<DESC>NOTICE OF EXTENSION TO RESPONSE DATE
ALL RESPONSES DUE BY COB 08/26/05

Description:  

You are invited to respond with information to assist the U.S. Department of State, Office of e-Diplomacy in identifying prospective providers for wireless handheld computing devices for worldwide implementation.  Further, the Department would like to review contractor existing solutions to meet the requirements as defined in this RFI.  Lastly, the objective of this RFI is to identify providers with demonstrated success in the offered solution.  Please use the information contained in this document and the format requested as the basis for your response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives to determining how to proceed with the acquisition process for the handheld devices and related services.  Industry responses will be used by the Government to assess feasibility, technical solutions, and acquisition approaches for worldwide implementation of wireless handheld computing devices.  The Government requests that no proprietary information be provided in response to this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.    					

Background:

Department of State (DoS) users are increasingly mobile, intensifying the need for adequate supporting technology. By providing personnel in the field with up-to-date resources and access to key information, diplomats and other Department employees can be more productive and effective. Remote access to DoS resources must serve numerous types of usage from casual email access to the mobile worker and teleworker who require an environment similar to that at their duty station office. The use of wireless handheld computing devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (commonly known as “PDAs”), provides one mechanism for users to have compact, mobile solutions to their business information access needs.

DoS users are keenly aware of the technologies available in the market place and know that if implementation slows, the gap between capability and need widens. If the gap is allowed to widen between available resources and user needs, a far greater risk to DoS business than the perceived risk associated with remote access looms ahead. The lack of availability of up-to-date information for the mobile user can in fact, place personnel and the DoS mission in unnecessary jeopardy.

User Business Needs:

The user needs and requirements for mobile computing devices were compiled through interviews, surveys and as a result of the wired PDA (hp iPAQ Pocket PC) and wireless (BlackBerry) pilot testing in 2004. In general, most users want reliable, up-to-date, and consistent access to e-mail, calendar, and contacts. Additional requirements from users include robust access to tasks, files, memos and Internet sites through their mobile device. The purpose and value of PDAs are to insure that Department of State users have current information readily accessible in an affordable, portable, compact, and digital form which adequately ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the information. Users will expect Department of State PDAs to have functionality as reliable and easy to use as those available “off-the-shelf” through commercial outlets.  This requirement does not support the use of non-U. S. Government (USG) devices, which cannot be connected to USG systems and networks.

Specifically, the solutions chosen should address the tiered nature of the business needs with a selection of devices providing a range of capabilities for the diverse needs of the DoS user.

User Requirements:

“MS Outlook” Type Functions

•	Provide full access to e-mail, calendar, contact and task items from the user's Microsoft Exchange profile.
•	Ensure that information is consistently synchronized between MS Exchange profiles and the mobile computing device (PDA) so that information is up to date.
•	Permit users to view, create, modify and store DoS e-mail, calendar items, contacts and tasks while away from the office.
•	Provide access to common e-mail attachments including, but not limited to, MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint and Adobe PDF files.
•	Provide Internet/Intranet web browsing from links in e-mail.

Other Functionality

•	Provide Internet/intranet web browsing from PDA.
•	Provide access to user documents and/or files that have been downloaded to the PDA.
•	Permit users to view, create, modify and store documents on the device.
•	Ensure that information is consistently synchronized between user's workstation and the PDA so that the documents/files remain current and reliable.
•	Permit users to utilize commonly-available peripherals such as printers, keyboards, external storage devices and projection devices.
•	Provide a reasonably priced solution to users stationed around the world.

Performance

•	Support maximum device storage capacity for users to manage information needed to complete business-related tasks, including standard add-on memory cards.
•	Permit quick access to stored information regardless of location. Users must be able to access and record unclassified information (only to which the user is entitled) in a reasonable timeframe during meetings and other times without overly burdensome security protocols. 
•	Provide continuous synchronization with MS Exchange profile so that new information is immediately available to the user.
•	Provide the option to synchronize with MS Exchange profiles from any workstation on OpenNet.
•	Support 24x7 resolution of technical issues in coordination with responsible systems administrator
•	Vendor managed solution

 

Technical Requirements
•	Must be COTS based (“off-the-shelf”)
•	Scalable
•	Deployable and operable worldwide
•	Centralized configuration and operations management, including:
•	Centralized security policy administration & enforcement capabilities
•	Remote lock/kill (only for wireless devices)
•	Password protection for DoS network access in accordance with Department standards
•	Multiple device types supported (wired and wireless/multiple form factors)
•	Patch management capabilities and remote configuration management services
•	Worldwide service (data and voice and equipment)
•	Available Application Programming Interface (API)

<DESC>Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed on 8  July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at the  Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was determined that  this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business (SB)Set-Aside.  The SB  strategy under consideration will require offers to provide aggressive small  business subcontracting participation in any proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the Acquisition Plan, we  will consider up to two awards for consolidated Function Areas A, B, C and E  under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best Value Source Selection decision).  Area D may be made as a stand alone award or combined with an A-B-C-E award.   Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that  will be addressed in a tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be  posted to PIXS in the next two weeks.   The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days to late Oct 2005.  Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP. Release of the formal  RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with proposals due early Jan  06. Award is contemplated late April 06.  A new attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort. ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005:  Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has been  added to the  library (scroll below).

Several Questions were asked about the  SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.  Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may  contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code,  etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function.  Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email?  ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please  allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC  submittals  to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil.

Collaborative  modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of  capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS)  concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of  security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the  appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems  acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through  sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation  studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and  support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are  anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below  which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three,  four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is  shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to  simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and  protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols;  and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in  PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution  activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or  assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities,  analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more  detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies,  virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for  simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses  areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality,  mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems  architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional  Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which  will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support;  Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the  Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF  Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support,  and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and  hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation  operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware,  Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems,  Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see  Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise  processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are  anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists  of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical  Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings,   the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support  to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets,  architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru  Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be  tasked thru task order might include participating in project System  Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group  meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to  include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop  simulations, etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test  plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects  in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in  planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a  specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer  Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 78,000 labor  hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a  total three year CORE effort of approximately 258,000 labor hours. The two  option years have an estimated 90,000 labor hours each. Customer events will  be supported using task orders.  Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of  intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor  Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR  awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is  anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied  upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and  Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees  will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret  clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although  they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All  personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should  be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any  resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these  contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award,  foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or  technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified  information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling,  Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition,  exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and  scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to  submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration. Firms having the capability to  perform one or more functions A – D (or E with one of the above) are invited  to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to  determine the appropriate small businesses strategy.  Based on the results of  the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside one or more  functions of this requirement for small businesses or to develop innovative  small business goals or arrangements.  Offerors shall indicate whether they  are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone  certified, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, veteran owned, or  Historically Black College/University and against which function(s) they are  submitting their SOC, and if your interest is as a prime contractor or as a  subcontractor.     The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the  offerors capabilities to perform in the specified five critical support  functions.  For each functional area (and the associated addendum) to which  you plan to respond, please answer the following questions.   1.	What is your experience in this functional area (as described in this  announcement and in the Appendix)?  Please include detailed examples, duration  and scope of relevant past work, including names and phone numbers of POCs.   2.

6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: October  2005 –   October 2007
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 








A. Basic Function of the position: 

The framework for the rule of law in Kosovo has been disrupted since 1989 when the Serb-dominated government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia took a series of actions to systematically exclude the ethnic Albanian majority from participation in the legal system and pursued a campaign of ethnic cleansing.   At the end of the conflict in 1999, the remains of the judicial system and the rule of law such as it existed in Kosovo collapsed, as the largely Serb judiciary and police fled, legal documentation was destroyed, and physical infrastructure was damaged.

The end of the conflict saw the emergence of an international consensus, codified in UN Security Council Resolution 1244, for a UN-led administration for Kosovo.  KFOR, an international force organized through NATO, provides peacekeeping.  An international police force (CIVPOL) is also operative, though a new local force (KPS) has assumed much of the responsibility for law enforcement.  Other leading players participating in the establishment of a new civil administration include the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is responsible under the UN umbrella for democratization and institution-building (including judicial system development); the European Union; and a host of bilateral donors including the United States.
During years since 1999, United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) has set in place the basic legal and administrative framework for a new judicial system in Kosovo, and begun to turn over governance authority to Kosovo's Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG), which include the Assembly, the President, the Government, the Courts, and certain other institutions.  However, five years into these arrangements, authority over the justice sector remains fragmented, with UNMIK retaining substantial authority.  Justice sector entities include the Department of Justice (DOJ - responsible for international judges and prosecutors, justice sector policy, and other issues), the Department of Judicial Administration (DJA - a part of the Ministry of Public Services responsible for administrative support to courts and prosecutors, and the bar exam), the Kosovo Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (KJPC - responsible for recommending appointment, discipline, and removal of judges and prosecutors), and a variety of OSCE-supported institutions (e.g., the Kosovo Judicial Institute, the Criminal Defense Resource Centre, the Kosovo Law Centre, and the Ombudsperson).  Other relevant organizations include the Chamber of Advocates (bar association), the Judges' Association, the Prosecutors' Association, and the Jurists' Association. Much of this is expected to change with the approval of a plan for UNMIK to transfer its authority over the justice and security sectors beginning in late 2005. 

Support for the development of rule of law and an independent and effective judiciary is a key element of accomplishing USAID’s strategic objectives in Kosovo, including accountable and transparent governance (SO. 2.1), and establishment of an institutional framework for economic growth and expansion (SO 1.3).
U.S. assistance for support of the judicial system has taken a number of forms.  In the post-conflict period, USAID has funded the following activities: 
1) the American Bar Association’s Central and East European Law Initiative (ABA/CEELI) has supported immediate legal training requirements, the formation and development of the Judges’ and bar associations, legislative analysis and drafting.  
2) The US National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and DPK Consulting have developed improved systems for court administration in fields such as personnel, accounting, procurement, and budgeting, and are currently providing further support for implementing the systems.  
3) The International Development Law Institute (IDLI) has begun assessing the practical skills training needs of judges and prosecutors, in preparation for a year long training program in conjunction with the Kosovo Judicial Institute.  
4) Partners for Democratic Change International (PDCI) have developed a mediation center and training program.  
5) USAID’s institutional contractor in support of economic restructuring has provided extensive support for the modernization of economic and commercial law, and will continue to do so.  

With the continued assistance of ABA/CEELI and NCSC, USAID is two years into the implementation of a five year ambitious rule of law program focused on: development of a long term justice system strategy with Kosovar and UNMIK input, continuing to increase court effectiveness, establishing functional disciplinary systems for legal professionals, and building public awareness of legal rights and responsibilities.
The State Department’s Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) has provided basic commodities for the courts system - primarily vehicles, generators, and computers. The U.S. Department of Justice has placed a number of legal advisor in the U.S. Office Pristina (USOP), working primarily on criminal law and training of prosecutors.

STATEMENT OF WORK:

General:
The Rule of Law Advisor (ROLA) will serve as the principal advisor to USAID/Kosovo on all issues and programs pertaining to legal sector reform and development.

<DESC>AC Power Service Entrance Surge Shunt Panels



The following document presents the scope of the AC Surge Shunt Panel Development Project for the Air Force Space Command Launch Support Building upgrade as outlined in related request for information/quotation documents.

The AC Surge Shunt Panel Development consists of a series of AC panels rated for use on service applications per schedule A.  Each panel shall consist of a two-stage surge suppressor array designed to meet the AC service requirements as well as the desired surge handling capabilities.

	Schedule A	
Unit	Service Voltage	Series Load Current
1	120VAC WYE	250A
2	480VAC Delta	250A
 Figure 1: Electrical Service Applications

The products shall be designed to provide continuous low voltage power distribution with suitable connector and conductor fittings. The surge suppression shall protect down stream loads from both high exposure lightning events and 20 second duration over-voltage/over-current fault conditions.

The contractor will conduct all required 8/20ìs Lightning Qualification testing at agreed upon levels in-house. All SREMP Driver testing, however, will be conducted by qualified third party test facilities at no expense to Transtector. SREMP testing will be performed by Boeing under prior direct agreements with Air Force Space Command.

The Surge Shunt Panel shall consist of a surge array designed to handle all nominal lightning conditions without degradation.  The surge arrays shall be housed in a robust enclosure to preclude external damage.  Upon catastrophic surge events (such as an SREMP driver or an AC power fault), the SASD array portion shall fail open and the robust MOV array portion shall fail short.  The MOV array shall be designed to withstand any available fault current without catastrophically failing and still exhibit a fail short condition.  Any subsequent surge events shall be shunted directly to ground.

The surge arrays shall be housed in a NEMA4 type enclosure, approximately 44” tall, x 24” wide x 12” deep.

All surge elements must remain in “same as new” operational status upon the application of 25 pulses, each polarity, each phase L-N modes, 50kA ASC, 7.5kVOCV surge levels, as described by test standard IEC 61643-1.

The unit shall exhibit a fail short electrical path upon the application of Over-voltage test with available fault current up to 65kAIC.

(U) Introduction
(U) This section documents the powerline SREMP current calculation for the near neighbor ECS trade study.  Figure 1 is a drawing showing the problem of interest.  A 1-megaton nuclear blast detonates about 6 kilometers from an LF.  The blast is located directly over the powerline that services an LF. The Compton current generated in the around the fireball drives current on the powerline and into the LF support building. 



















Figure 1.  SREMP Coupling to a Powerline (arrows show electron flow which is opposite from positive current flow)
      



(U) The powerline close to the fireball sees the E field in the highly dosed region around the fireball (600m – 800m).  This E field contact drives current down the power line and into the LF support building.  The majority of the current drive occurs during the quasi-static phase of the SERMP drive when secondary gammas, produced from ground capture and air capture neutrons, drive a Compton current that lasts for several milliseconds.

(U) Fireball Voltage
(U) By integrating the E field outward from the fireball, we get a ground voltage profile as shown in Figure 2.

















Figure 2. Ground voltage due to neutron captures Compton current.

(U) The fireball is highly conductive and therefore has one constant voltage.  The ground voltage outside the fireball extends out to about 600 meters.   Since this distance is small compared to the distance between LFs (about 6000m), we can lump the ground voltage drive onto a powerline as a voltage driver as shown in Figure 3:














Figure 3.  Fireball voltage driver.


(U) We choose fireball voltage driver parameters to reflect a 1 MT bomb and a soil conductivity of 0.001 1/ohm-m.  From previous calculations we know that the chosen soil conductivity maximizes the powerline current.

(U) The fireball resistance is dominated by the air channel return current and has a value of (Reference 1):

RS » 1 ohm

(U) The fireball inductance is computed in Reference 1 as:

LS » 0.0001 henrys

(U) The formula for the fireball voltage, V(t), as a function of time, is obtained from scaling data in Reference 2 and can be expressed as a sum of two exponentials:

 		(1)

(U) The fireball voltage is plotted in Figure 4 using a log-log scale to clearly show the both exponential components:





















Figure 4.   Fireball voltage as a function of time.

(U) The first exponential component with decay time of 1.1 milliseconds comes from gamma radiation produced by ground capture neutrons.  The second exponential component with decay time of 25 milliseconds comes from gamma radiation produced by air-captured neutrons. 

(U) Powerline Model
(U) We now construct a lumped circuit model of a powerline.  A typical rural electric powerline is composed of wires mounted on top of a 40 ft (12m) wooden pole.  The poles are placed 225 ft (65m) apart.  The powerline uses three 4/0 aluminum clad steel reinforced (ACSR) wire.  For lightning protection, lighting arrestors are typically place every 1700 ft (500m) along a powerline run.  The lighting arrestor uses an 8 ft ground rod driven into the ground at the base of the power pole.  There is always a lighting arrestor at the LF service pole, before the step-down transformer.

(U) The lumped circuit model of the powerline is shown in Figure 5.  Because we are dealing with the millisecond timeframe (Equation 1), we chose to divide the 6000m powerline into two 3000m segments.  Each 3000m segment is modeled as a resistor and inductor in series.  At the 3000 meter mark we construct one resistor to ground at is the parallel combination of all the lighting arrestors along a 6000-meter run of powerline.  Finally we model the site resistance as a 2.5 ohm resistor (Reference 3) for a soil conductivity of 0.001 1/ohm-m.  














Figure 5. Lumped circuit for SREMP current on Powerline

(U) The equation and numerical values of the parameters in Figure 5 are:

 

(U) The line inductance includes the internal inductance of each line, the line inductance of each line assuming magnetic skin depth cutoff in 0.001 1/ohm-m soil at 1 millisecond (Reference 3), and the mutual inductance between all three lines using the methods in Reference 4.
(U) The circuit model response was computed using the SPICE code that uses an implicit differential equation solver.  We then divided the site current by 3 to compute the SREMP current per wire into the LSB.  The result of this calculation is shown in Figure 6.





















Figure 6 SREMP current per powerline wire into the LF site.

(U) The same current per wire is plotted on a log-log scale in Figure 7 to ephasize the fact there is a significant SREMP current tail due to air captured neutrons.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), on behalf of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) desires information that may lead to the acquisition and qualification of a family of 120mm mortar ammunition for enhancing the AC-130 Gunship Lethality and Survivability.   NSWCDD and AFSOC are seeking information on any (guided or conventional) 120mm mortar round that is currently fielded or a Program of Record (POR).  The ammunition must be capable of launch from the M120 tube.  T! he 120mm mortar concept shall offer benefits to the AC-130 fleet through: Employment flexibility through use of munitions currently available, Greater lethality through more fragmentation weight and greater blast damage, Precision strike capability, Increased standoff range and attack altitude while maintaining responsiveness, Reduction in collateral damage, and Reduction in danger close distance when supporting troops in contact.  Responses must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, reference customers (to confirm COTS/NDI status of the product, if applicable), product production history (volume, if applicable), summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.

<SUBJECT>R -- COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH OF ATMOSPHERIC DATA
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Iowa  for collaborative research with three University of Iowa research groups to conduct analysis of atmospheric data acquired from a tower site located in the vicinity of Iowa City, Iowa in order to carry out a first order estimation of regional fluxes of carbon dioxide as well as to support a mid-continent intensive study planned for the summer of 2006.  The research groups of Charles Stanier, Gregory Carmichael, and William Eichinger, all at the University of Iowa, are uniquely suited to meet these needs.  The groups already have experience in similar field projects, specifically, the operation of lidar instrumentation.  Period of performance shall be September 1, 2005 to September 30, 2006.  This joint effort is for CMDL to meet the North American goals of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.  CMDL requires regular, long-term measurements from the planned eastern Iowa tall tower site, within a network of carefully chosen sites in North America, to study the variation of greenhouse gases with height, which will enable CMDL and other scientists to quantify the predicted North American terrestrial biosphere’s net uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Quantifying the North American carbon budget and identifying implications for the global carbon cycle are priority items outlined in the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and shall address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Award date will be September 6, 2005.

As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. 
(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. Alternate I (Oct 2003).  As prescribed in 4.1104(a), substitute the following paragraph (b) for paragraph (b) of the basic clause: (b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the CCR database by December 31, 2003.  The Contractor shall maintain registration during performance and through final payment of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall enter DUNS NUMBER:____________ and TIN:____________ with their quote. Quotes shall include a total price for the two items above.

Statement of Work For Integration of DoD Data to Terrorist Watchlist Phase II
1. PURPOSE. The Defense Intelligence Agency's (DIA) Joint Intelligence Task Force for Combating Terrorism (JITF-CT) proposes to obtain all-source intelligence analysts to identify and integrate Defense derived data into the Terrorist Screening Center administered Terrorist Screening Database via the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) in support of its combating terrorism and defense of the Homeland missions. The Contractor personnel will work with the Government to achieve this objective. 2. BACKGROUND. The primary mission of the JITF-CT is to provide timely and accurate global terrorism threat intelligence support to Department of Defense policy-makers and operational commanders at all echelons of command: national, theater, and tactical during peace, crisis, and war whether involved in unilateral, bilateral, or multinational operations.  As such, JITF-CT intelligence analysts are responsible for all aspects of Tier 1 Terrorist groups and are responsible for ensuring Defense data is integrated into other US roles and mission, to include watchlisting. 3. OBJECTIVE.  The overall objective of this task involves the Contractor conducting intelligence analysis of Defense intelligence data to identify known or suspected terrorists and nominate these to NCTC for entry into the TIDE database, for inclusion in the NCTC Terrorist Identities database, and for onward movement of the information to the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), to include nominations for no-fly or selectee lists as indicated by provided criteria. 4. SCOPE OF WORK. The Contractor shall perform the following tasks for this effort.  The Contractor shall provide eleven intelligence analysts with the requisite intelligence analysis and writing skills to accomplish the following tasks.

STATEMENT OF WORK   GENERAL The Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Border Patrol (OBP) has been tasked with detecting and apprehending terrorists and their weapons. To assist in accomplishing this mission, the OBP is embarking on a project to utilize specially trained canine teams.  These canines are to be trained in the disciplines of criminal location and apprehension as well as explosive detection.  The successful contractor is expected to supply canines in accordance with the specific requirements indicated below: REQUIREMENTS The requirements of this agency for replacement canines are: 
a.	Breeds -Either Belgian Malinois or Dutch Shepherds are acceptable. German Shepherds and Belgian herding breeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Government. b. Lineage -The canine shall be European born or of European lineage 
traceable by two generations. Proof of lineage shall be provided with each delivery. The absence of proper documentation will be grounds for rejecting a canine. American-bred canines may be accepted on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Government. c.  Age -The canine shall have a documented age between twelve (12) and thirty-eight (38) months. d.  Weight -The canine shall weigh no less than forty-five (45) pounds nor more than ninety (90) pounds. e. Size -The canine shall measure not less than twenty-two (22) inches no more than thirty (30) inches at the shoulder. f. Sex -The canine may be either male or female.  SELECTION CRITERIA The Border Patrol personnel at the National Canine Facility in El Paso, TX will administer a series of tests on the canine to determine whether it has the capability of working in a Border Patrol environment. The canine is required to pass these tests in order to be accepted in the canine training program. These tests are described in the following section. SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS Detection Testing  - The canine will be utilized in various detection fields.  To comply with the training protocols utilized the canine shall exhibit an obsession to play with objects, have stable character, be gun-sure and willing to surmount difficult obstacles. The canine should prefer to play with objects more than having food, water, or the attention of its handler. No commands will be given for the canine to retrieve.  Listed below are several tests that provide insight into a candidate's suitability in the detection field. National Canine Facility (NCF) staff instructors will perform all tests.  a.  Stable Character Test -The canine will be brought around several people to judge how it responds. It should not be afraid or act aggressively toward anyone who approaches it. A happy, social attitude should be seen in its behavior. The canine will be walked on smooth tile floors to see if it is sure-footed. The canine should display no fear or discomfort. While the canine is standing or walking on leash in a passive state, an umbrella will be opened suddenly in its face. The canine may show a slight startled reaction but should recover quickly. The canine will be tested for gun sureness with several unusually loud gunshots fired from about 50 feet behind it in which the canine should show little or no reaction. The canine will be taken into tight places to see how it responds. It should confidently enter and investigate these areas without hesitation. In addition to the above tests, a search of a vehicle with the engine running may be performed at the discretion of the Government.  b. Retrieve/Prey Drive Test -The canine will be evaluated to see if it will pursue not only objects it is familiar with, but also strange, hard and soft objects. This test will be conducted in a ravine or on a hill. The canine, handler, and evaluator will stand downhill and the handler will throw each object uphill and out-of-sight. With each object, the canine will be held on-line and will be released with no command. One by one, several objects, familiar and strange, will be thrown uphill for the canine to pursue. The canine will be judged on its alertness, speed, hunt and grab of each object. The purpose is to determine if the canine will hunt for and play with strange objects while being physically stressed. Examples of strange objects are: a piece of PVC pipe, a block of wood, a piece of metal pipe, etc.  The canine’s behavior in this test will be assessed against the following ideal behavior:  1. Alert -The canine should show undistracted interest when presented with each object and pull hard against the leash as the object is being thrown. 2. Speed -Upon being released, the canine should demonstrate extreme physical effort in running to the area where the object fell. 3. Hunt -Upon reaching the area, the canine must show effective use of its olfactory senses in locating the object.  4. Grab -Upon locating the object, the canine should immediately grab it in its mouth and show a desire and satisfaction in playing with the object.  c. Perseverance Test -The canine will be pre-stimulated with an object that will then be placed under a heavy object (cement block, tire, etc.). The canine will then be released. The canine will be evaluated on its drive and desire to work out the problem and obtain the object. The purpose is to determine whether the canine possesses a sufficient desire to work to obtain the object and to determine the canine's natural indication behavior (passive/aggressive). Ideal behavior for this test is, upon reaching the location of the object, the canine immediately engages in frantic biting and scratching behavior in an effort to dig and obtain the object, or a frozen stare at the location of the object.  d. Water Conflict Test -After the retrieve/prey test, the canine will be taken to a location where there will be a small pond, stream or container of water. The canine will be shown the water and pre-stimulated with the object that will be thrown beyond the water. The canine will then be released. The ideal behavior is that the canine goes directly to the object without stopping to take a drink. e. Food Conflict Test -A test similar to the water conflict will be conducted with food. The canine will be pre-stimulated with the object that is then thrown downwind of the food. The canine will then be released. The desired behavior is that the canine disregards the food and pursues the object. f. Handler/Object Conflict Test -The canine will be brought to a location where there will be a six-foot high chain link fence or an overturned milk crate or like item. The canine will be pre-stimulated with an object that will be placed behind the fence or under the milk crate. The canine will then be released and the handler will walk out of sight. The canine should go to the object, show keen interest and remain unaffected by the absence of the handler. g. Hunt Drive Test -The canine will be brought to a location where there will be a high degree of grass or brush. The canine will be pre-stimulated with an object which will be thrown deep (over 40 yards) into the grass or brush. The purpose is to determine the level of the canine's hardness in pushing through the brush and if the canine will search for an extended period of time without losing interest. The ideal behavior for this test is that the canine crash through the brush with maximum physical effort. Once in the brush, the canine must exhibit concentrated and frantic hunting behavior utilizing its olfactory senses. The canine is expected to maintain this behavior for an extended period (4 to 5 minutes) without any assistance from the handler until such time as it locates the object. Upon locating the object, the canine should immediately grab the object in its mouth and demonstrate satisfaction in playing with it. h. On-line Search Test -The canine will be brought to a search area (shelves, vehicles, building, etc.). The canine will then be pre-stimulated with an object that will . be placed out of sight in the search area at a location above ground level. The canine will then be directed through a systematic search of the area on a leash. Included in this search will be several areas above waist level. The purpose is to determine the degree of trainability and handler sensitivity in the canine. Ideal behavior for this test is that the canine will follow all directional commands and signals made by the handler. The canine must demonstrate effective use of its olfactory senses in searching the area where it is directed. Upon reaching the hidden object, the canine should show quick recognition of the object's odor and display an undistracted desire to follow this odor and obtain the object.  Apprehension Testing - The canine will also be trained to search for, detain, and when necessary physically apprehend non compliant subjects.  To be effective in this task the canine must exhibit strong desire to hunt for people and an unwavering ability to engage in physical combat with a violent subject. Listed below are five tests that will be utilized to evaluate the candidate’s suitability in this field.  In these descriptions the person handling the canine through testing is referred to as the “handler” and the person who will engage in physical combat with the canine is referred to as the “decoy”.  In all but the last test (Test 5), the canine will be placed in a secure muzzle designed for the purpose of apprehension training. National Canine Facility (NCF) staff instructors will approve all equipment utilized for testing, act as decoys, and perform all tests. a. Test 1, Run-Away Out-Of-Sight – The handler brings the canine to a spot designated by the evaluator.  The decoy emerges from a concealed location approximately seventy-five yards in front of the handler and canine.  While the handler holds the canine on leash, the decoy makes threatening gestures and turns and runs back out of sight.  Once out of sight of the canine and handler, the decoy runs to a location approximately thirty yards away and up wind.  Once there, the decoy stands motionless for the rest of the test.  The evaluator will instruct the handler to release the canine approximately ten seconds after the decoy first goes out of sight.  The handler is to remain at this starting point until the evaluator determines that the test is completed.  The canine’s behavior in this test will be assessed against the following ideal behavior: 1. Alert – The canine should show an undistracted intense interest in the decoy while he makes threatening gestures and runs away.  2. Speed - Upon being released, the canine should demonstrate extreme physical effort in running to the area where the decoy was last seen.  3. Hunt - Upon reaching the area, the canine must show effective use of its olfactory senses in locating the decoy.  4. Guard – Upon locating the decoy, the canine must show unwavering and undistracted desire to solicit combat from the decoy, either actively striking, or intensely barking at, the decoy.  The canine must demonstrate this behavior for a period of not less than sixty seconds.  b. Test 2, Straight Run-Away - The handler brings the canine to a spot designated by the evaluator.  The decoy emerges from a concealed location approximately forty yards in front of the handler and canine.  While the handler holds the canine on leash, the decoy makes threatening gestures and turns and runs away.  At this point the evaluator instructs the handler to release the canine. For the duration of the test the decoy continues to flee and provide no further stimulation to the canine and the handler remains at the starting point. The canine’s behavior in this test will be assessed against the following ideal behavior:  1. Alert - The canine should show an undistracted intense interest in the decoy while he makes threatening gestures and runs away.  2. Speed - Upon being released, the canine should demonstrate extreme physical effort in pursuing the decoy.  3. Hit – Upon catching up to the decoy, the canine should launch with a firm muzzle strike that is placed high in the center of the back of the decoy.  4. Fight – With the decoy only continuing the run, the canine continues to actively engage and fight the decoy with multiple muzzle strikes.  c. Test 3, Courage Test - The handler brings the canine to a spot designated by the evaluator.  The decoy emerges from a concealed location approximately forty yards in front of the handler and canine.  While the handler holds the canine on leash, the decoy makes threatening gestures and turns and runs away.  At this point the evaluator instructs the handler to release the canine.  The handler remains at the starting point for the duration of the test.  When the canine is approximately halfway to the decoy he will turn and charge the canine, making threatening gestures and yelling.  As the canine gets close, the decoy will then throw light material (i.e. leaves, grass) at the canine. After the initial contact with the canine the decoy engages in active physical combat with strong threatening behavior.  The canine’s behavior in this test will be assessed against the following ideal behavior:  1. Alert - The canine should show an undistracted intense interest in the decoy while he makes threatening gestures and runs away.  2. Speed - Upon being released, the canine should demonstrate extreme physical effort in the pursuit and not slow or deviate his path when approaching the charging decoy.  3. Hit – The canine should ignore the thrown material and immediately launch with a firm muzzle strike placed high in the chest of the decoy.  4. Fight – With the decoy providing strong threatening behavior, the canine continues to actively engage and fight the decoy with multiple muzzle strikes.  d. Test 4, Handler Defense – The handler is instructed to walk in a certain direction with the canine on leash at the handler’s left side.  The decoy has been pre placed in a concealed location along the route on the handler’s right side.  When the handler and canine are even with the decoy’s location, the decoy suddenly becomes visible and simulates an attack on the handler, displaying threatening behavior and yelling.  The handler drops the leash at this point and remains quiet for the duration of the test.  Following the initial contact with the canine, the decoy engages in active physical combat and administers two strikes with a flexible agitation stick across the canine’s shoulders.  The canine’s behavior in this test will be assessed against the following ideal behavior:  1. Control – The canine demonstrates calm yet alert behavior when walking on leash.  2. Defense – Upon being suddenly confronted with the threatening decoy, the canine immediately lunges across the handler’s body and strikes the decoy high in the chest.  3.  Fight  - With the decoy providing strong threatening behavior, the canine continues to actively engage and fight the decoy with multiple muzzle strikes.  4.  Stick Hits – When being struck with the agitation stick, the canine disregards the blows and continues to fight.  e. Test 5, Cable Bite – The un-muzzled canine is staked out to a stationary object utilizing a six to ten foot cable or line.  With the handler out of sight, the decoy approaches the canine wearing a protective exposed bite sleeve.  When directed by the evaluator, the decoy displays threatening behavior and delivers the sleeve within range of the canine.  Once the canine bites the sleeve, the decoy engages in active physical combat and administers two strikes with a flexible agitation stick across the canine’s shoulders.  At the direction of the evaluator, the decoy then slips the protective sleeve off of his arm and continues to display threatening behavior.  The canine’s behavior in this test will be assessed against the following ideal behavior:  1. Alert - The canine should show an undistracted intense interest in the decoy from the time he first becomes visible and demonstrates threatening gestures.  2. Bite – The canine immediately bites the sleeve when it comes into range utilizing all of his mouth and demonstrates confidant body language with extreme bite pressure.   3.  Fight  - With the decoy providing strong threatening behavior, the canine continues to actively engage and fight the decoy while maintaining the initial firm bite.  4.  Stick Hits – When being struck with the agitation stick, the canine disregards the blows and continues to fight with no weakening of bite pressure.  5. Sleeve – When the decoy slips off the protective sleeve and displays threatening behavior, the canine immediately releases the sleeve and demonstrates undistracted intense interest in the decoy.  TEMPERAMENT AND GENETIC DRIVES  Throughout the selection phase, the canine must show that it possesses the temperament and genetic drives to work within a Border Patrol environment based on the following criteria:  a. Socialization -The canine must possess a sound temperament that will allow it to be approached by and work around groups of people without showing fear, distraction, or reacting aggressively.  b. Courage/Confidence -The canine must display lack of fear and not be distracted by the following situations and environments:  1. Unsure footing (slick floors, rubble, etc.)  2.

Any contractor who is awarded a contract as a result of this BAA must first be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The website address for CCR database is http://www.ccr.gov.  The NAICS Code is 541710. AGENCY CONTACTS:  Questions prior to the submission of Proposals can be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Dinah.L.Mulligan@uscg.mil or (860) 441-2885.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.   THE BAA SUBJECT AREA is as follows: 
                                                
Background:

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has developed various devices to entangle the propellers of small outboard or inboard/outboard (IO) powered craft (length over all up to 40 feet, total power up to 675 HP using one or more outboard or I/O engines) that do not comply with orders to stop.  An existing system, the Running Gear Entanglement System (RGES) consists of a header-line with U-shaped loops of rope suspended below it.  It has been proven effective, but must be deployed by dragging it in front of the vessel to be stopped.  There is also an existing MK 10 version that is deployed by firing the RGES from a canister using compressed air.  The MK10 needs to be semi-permanently mounted on the vessel’s machine gun mount, thus interfering with the use of the vessel’s machine gun.  It can only be used from one side of the CG vessel, and cannot be fired more than once in any given mission or case.  Small craft such as CG rigid hull inflatables, port security boats or utility boats (UTBs) have a need for a more portable system that can be hand-fired and reloaded quickly.  The USCG has found that it’s relatively easy to fire a net into the water such that the net affixes itself to the lower unit.  The difficulty has been in getting the net to entangle the vessel’s propeller blades. 

The next step of research and development is broken into two phases.  Phase I produces a concept design and conducts a design review at the developer’s facility;  develops a working launching and entanglement concept demonstrator; delivers a test plan for Government approval, and conducts deployment and entanglement demonstrations against an outboard-powered planing boat.  Phase I also develops a test report and delivers one working concept demonstrator of the launching system and net.  Phase II makes any needed improvements and modifications and performs uniform testing of promising systems against a standardized target craft.   

Scope:  The scope of this BAA covers all of Phase I.

Requirements:

General:  The USCG is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) soliciting concept designs, proposed modifications of existing systems, and/or working prototypes of small portable net entanglement systems.  The “nets” shall be at least 50 feet in length, made of a suitable rope or twine to entangle one or more propellers on an outboard powered planing craft at least 15 feet in length.  The entire net/projectile assembly shall be easily recoverable.  Any projectile used to pull the net shall pose minimum risk of injury to persons onboard the vessel to be entangled.  Our experience indicates that many nets simply wrap around the lower unit of the engine above the anti-ventilation plates, fail to entangle the propeller, and sometimes slip off due to greater pull on one side of the net than the other.  Drag devices (e.g. small drogues) or diving planes on both ends of the net help to prevent it from slipping around the lower unit of an engine and to facilitate propeller entanglement, which is the desired end state; however, other proposed solutions are welcome.  The leading end of the net shall be capable of being propelled at least 100 feet from the launcher.  The system shall be re-loadable with a new net or net canister and propellant/charge mechanism in less than thirty seconds.  The net may be propelled using compressed air, a ballistic charge or other means.  The system shall be capable of surviving in a marine environment.  Compatibility with commercial line throwers, a twelve-gauge shotgun, 40 mm M-203 launcher, or other standard issue firearm is desirable but is not required.  Recoil shall be as low as possible to allow firing from a person’s shoulder, and exhaust gasses shall not pose a hazard to those behind the shooter.  Total weight of the system shall not exceed 30 pounds, and shall be able to be held and fired by a normal-sized person in a 25’ boat in “at sea” conditions.  

Deliverables: The offeror shall host a design review meeting at their facility once their concept design is completed, but before attempting to build their concept demonstrator.  The offeror shall also submit a draft test plan to the Government for review/comment prior to the design review meeting.  The offeror shall fabricate a working concept demonstrator and prepare a detailed test plan for Government approval.  The Government will conduct a Design Review meeting at the contractor’s facility.  The Government will then witness the offeror’s concept demonstrator deployed against a moving target of at least a 15-foot long outboard-powered planing craft.  The offeror shall then prepare and deliver a detailed test report including test results, prototype specifications, and estimated unit costs for quantities of one and one hundred systems. The offeror shall also deliver one working concept demonstrator system to the Government.

Schedule:

Phase 1 efforts shall be completed by August 31, 2006.  The Government anticipates Phase 2 work to be completed by August 31, 2007.    

Evaluation Criteria:  

(1)	Technical (two equally weighted subcriteria):
(a)	Technical Merit: Technical merit is comprised of the following equally weighted subcriteria: (1) Design considerations and effectiveness of entanglement device; (2) Storage or packing of the entanglement device; (3) Particulars of launching mechanism and range; (4) System portability, hand-held and shoulder launchable; (5) Recoil forces and user safety issues; (6) Rapidly re-loadable; (7) Ease of net recovery; (8) Maritime environment durability and corrosion issues; (9) System Maturity - state of development and performance of a working prototype; and (10) Awareness of and proposed solutions to propeller entanglement problem.

(b)	Past Performance: Past performance has two equally weighted subcriteria: (1) Relevance to the BAA; and (2) Customer performance ratings.

(2) Cost:  The cost proposal shall include a breakdown of all labor, material and overhead costs associated with development and demonstration of the system, including fee.  Cost proposals will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with proposal preparation instructions.  The cost proposal will be evaluated to determine if the proposed costs are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the Government’s requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror’s technical proposal.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, 
an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).     Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-85), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:     202-267-2285, Fax:     202-267-4011.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  “Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group, which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION  prepared by the National Park Service in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation No Q5630050039   is issued as a Request for Request for Quote (RFQ) and will be awarded as a firm-fixed price for Archaeological Services, using simplified acquisition procedures. Bidders must be members of the  Society of Professional Archeologist (SOPA) and/or The Society of Historical Archaeology. Responses should be be reflective of the priorities of the sites listed.This is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541720 the size standard is $6.0 million dollars. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-05. The solicitation item is as follows: Background/Purpose & Project Description: During the 2004 North Atlantic hurricane season, four tropical systems tracked within close proximity to Cumberland Island National Seashore (CUIS).  The tidal surge and wave action associated with these storms caused significant erosion to the island's shoreline, particularly on the western and northern side, which are also referred to as the "back-barrier".  These back-barrier shorelines contain a number of known archeological sites and likely contain others that have yet to be identified or fully investigated.  The sites represent both historic and prehistoric activity, dating back as far as 2000 B.C. Natural and anthropogenic forces have steadily contributed to the erosion of the back-barrier and, as a result, the loss of archeological resources and their inherent record.  However, major events such as the recent hurricanes lead to rapid cutting, slumping, and erosion.  Most vulnerable are the sites that directly face the open waters of Cumberland Sound, St. Andrews Sound, and their tributary rivers.  Artifacts are exposed, displaced, washed out, or completely swept away.  This project is intended to recover materials that have been exposed and are susceptible to imminent loss, conduct initial archeological investigations of the selected sites before further disruption or loss occurs, and produces an analysis of the data recovered.  The priorities in site selection are based on the amount of impact suffered during the storms, which sites have been previously investigated and evaluated the least, and the potential significance.  The priority order is as follows: 1.	Fort St. Andrews Complex (CUIS-49, NPS 9 CAM 49) 2.	Brickkiln Bluff (CUIS-24, NPS 9 CAM 24) 3.	Dungeness Wharf (CUIS-6, NPS 9 CAM 6) To accomplish the project objectives Cumberland Island National Seashore is seeking the assistance of a qualified archeologist.  All work will conform to National Park Service and professional standards for archeological research.  The principal investigator for the project will submit a work plan prior to initiation of any fieldwork.  Qualifications and/or vita of the principal investigator(s) must be submitted to ensure that they meet NPS standards.  The work plan will set forth the scope, objectives, methods, schedule, and budget for the project.  It must be sufficiently detailed to allow for technical and administrative review by cultural resource specialists.   SCOPE OF WORK:  Baseline research: Work entails background review and analysis of existing documents and records pertinent to the site(s) to be investigated, to include historic and prehistoric activity.  The review is to also include all previous archeological investigations conducted for the specific site(s). Surface survey and collection: Work entails visual surface survey of the site(s) and its immediate environs to recover historic and prehistoric materials that have been washed out or otherwise exposed, and to aid in delineation of site(s) boundaries.  Material is to be geo-referenced by using the same baseline grid as previous investigations or, if one does not exist, a grid that is compatible with NPS standards.  Artifacts are to be assigned field site numbers.  Artifact preparation and cataloguing will be addressed in a separate specification. Systematic shovel testing: The need for systematic shovel testing will be based on whether such work has been previously conducted at a specific site and/or what the initial investigation components have revealed.  It is known that prior testing has occurred at the Brickkiln Bluff and Dungeness Wharf sites.  Testing grids will be geo-referenced to the same baseline as previous grids or, if one does not exist, a grid that is compatible to NPS standards and incorporates the grid established for surface collection.  The principal investigator will base testing range and intervals on anticipated site dimensions.  Intervals will be reduced appropriately if culturally positive units are encountered.  Tests are to be excavated to culturally sterile soil.  The soil from each provenience will be screened through ¼-inch wire mesh.  Artifacts are to be assigned field site numbers. Unit level testing: The execution of Phase II type testing may be necessary based on the findings of the systematic shovel testing.  Highest priority for this level of testing will be based on artifact concentrations and/or features that are in imminent threat of loss due to erosion or similar disturbance.  The goal of this more intensive testing is to better define the location, characteristics, scientific values, conditions, and significance of the inherent archeological resources.  Test units are to be standard 1 x 1 meter excavations, and geo-referenced.  Units are to be excavated stratigraphically down to culturally sterile soil.  Soil from the test units is to be screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. Object/artifact treatment: Archeological objects and specimens collected during the study will be cleaned, stabilized and prepared for curatorial storage in the CUIS facility.  The principal investigator will coordinate with the CUIS Curator to ensure that these materials and their associated records are properly documented for accessioning into the park collection and cataloguing in the Park Service's ANCS+ database. Data analysis: Detailed analysis is to be conducted for individual sites and features, as well as non-site specific artifacts.  The effects of natural processes and human activity are also to be assessed.  In addition, overall site stratigraphy is to be evaluated.   Report production: See "Products" section to follow.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award (End of Provision).
