The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requestson FedBid. The Department's operational OpenNet infrastructure relies on MicrosoftExchange and Blackberry for Exchange. In order to remain in compliance, theDepartment must have valid software licenses for each server running BlackBerryfor Exchange. The purpose of acquisition of licenses at this time is to bring theDepartment into compliance with Research in Motion in terms of BlackBerryServer software running on servers attached to OpenNet.  This is an urgently needed, highly specialized, best fit requirement based uponthe Department's current reliance on BlackBerry software for OpenNet.  In theevent this request is not approved, the Department will not be in compliance andrisks not being able to communicate using BlackBerry devices on OpenNet.<BR><BR>Reposted to include J&A in buy term and to post to FBO.<BR><BR>

These final files will be Fasta files of ORFs and annotation files for those ORFs in tab-delimited format with column headers. Two files total, per composite, or single genome effort shall be constructed, one in fasta format and the other in annotation format. Unique identifiers specific to ERGO annotations for all orfs present in the RML ERGO server shall be incorporated into the annotation files. The final Fasta and annotation files shall match the format the chip manufacturer requests. The final Fasta and annotation files shall meet Project Officer specifications. During the production of the files Integrated Genomics shall communicate with the chip manufacturer and the RML Project Officer in order to make sure that compliance with chip design requirements in the form of these files is occurring. A final Conference call will occur with the RML Project Officer and, the chip contractor and Integrated Genomics to make sure that all of the file requirements have been met at the end of the contract. The following genomes, shall be included in this effort: Composite Genome, Genes Only, mycobacterium abscessus (ATCC 19977) (ERGO: MAB), Mycobacterium avium 104 (ERGO: MAI), Mycobacterium bovis BCG str. Pasteur 1173P2 (ERGO: MBO), Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2 (ERGO: MSM), Mycobacterium tuberculosis KZN 1435 (ERGO: MTG), and Mycobaterium ulcerans Agy99 (ERGO: MUL). All genomes shall undergo intra- and inter-comparative analysis in order to identify regions of duplication and uniqueness. For composite genome construction, one genome shall be designated as the backbone genome and shall be represented in the orf and annotation flat files in its near entirety (absent homologous repetitive sequences at a 97% DNA identity or higher). Subsequent genomes that are within the same genus, but that shall make up the composite aspects of the genome shall only be represented at the level of unique sequences not present in the backbone genome (at 96% DNA identity or less). Annotation must reflect this origin of sequence and the connection to the backbone genome. Decisions regarding whether to perform composite construction versus individual genome representation will be based upon the contractor running test analyses, which may or may not involve BLAST searches/comparisons at different levels of DNA identity or similarity stringencies. If genomes are syntenous, composite construction can work, if they are nonsyntenous, demonstrating many genomic changes and differences, then independent representation might be the best option. Final decisions on composite versus single or independent representation shall be made following discussion and approval with the Project Officer. Final annotation and flat files shall have unique orf identifiers connected to the ERGO server and compatible with the ERGO server. The Contractor must have access, experience and proprietary rights for interacting with the ERGO server such that interactions will not void or cancel existing service and support contracts for the ERGO SERVER. The chip contractor shall be the sole source for probe pair design, synthesis and manufacturing of the chip. Sequence and annotation files shall be submitted to them by Integrated Genomics following review and approval by the RML project Officer. Step #1: Receipt of all genomic materials: From date of receipt of materials, Total 10 (ten) days. The contractor shall provide to RML confirmation that for each genome category effort, the contractor has all of the necessary materials to proceed effectively. A brief report shall also be provided outlining any areas of potential difficulty. Step 2: Sequence scanning and analysis of all genomes. Duration: 1 (one) month total from end of receipt of materials (Step 1) for all composite, and single genomes to delivery of flat files to the chip contractor. Two flat files for each composite and single genome effort, consisting of a sequence flat file and an annotation file shall be delivered by email, ftp or on CD to the project officer for review and forwarded onto the chip contractor. Flat files delivered to the chip contractor for each genome effort shall be 100% compatible with their design criteria as defined by them. Composite and single genome flat file sets, including, but not limited to fasta orf files and annotation files may be delivered individually per group and invoiced as such, following acceptable review by the project officer. The contractor shall keep all RML-derived data secure and will not release or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, or transfer deliverables, contractor computers will be secure and in compliance with RML IT security procedures and policies.

This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer.  In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer.  Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.arnet.gov; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Feb 2009).

Offerors are required to submit on-line Reps & Certs (see https://orca.bpn.gov/).  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in their latest editions apply to this solicitation:   52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jun 2008).  The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause:

Note 1:  If submitting other than brand name NB 993, the contractor shall be required to submit for approval a first article lot production in accordance with FAR clause 52.209 which is included in this solicitation.  The first article lot shall include the 100 pairs of tennis shoes (sizes will be provided at contract award).  Approval as used in this paragraph means the contracting officers written notification to the contractor accepting the test results of the first article.  The initial delivery order expected to be awarded at the time of award or shortly thereafter, will execute the first article testing requirement.

Note 2:  Initial delivery of no less than a quantity of 1,000 pairs of tennis shoes within 90 days after approval of first article test and delivery thereafter of no less than a quantity of 1,000 tennis shoes every 60 days after issuance of subsequent delivery orders until delivery is complete.

Note 6:  Offerors are limited to providing only one proposal each (i.e., product).

Note 7:  The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  
(End of addendum)

BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1)  PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION MODELS (PDMs) - will be evaluated for the following:

Conformance with the salient characteristics of the description/specification; pass the Shock Attenuation Test and Forefoot Flexibility Test and visual examinations.

2)  PAST PEFORMANCE  will be evaluated for the following:

Relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

3) Price:  For evaluation purposes, all offerors should submit pricing for maximum ordering quantities of 7,500 pairs for each of the five (5) years.  The offerors proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Award under this procurement will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Both factors mentioned above are of equal importance and both factors are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the following questions and answers:
1. (Question): Could you provide info on ambulances: Make, model, year , and engine?(Answer): Mercy 1: make-Ford, model- MPV, year-July 2008, engine- 350 V-8 6.4L, VIN#1FDWF37RX8ED96223, USN#G31-0166B. Mercy 4: make-Ford, model-MPV, year-November 2004, engine-350 V-8 6.0L, VIN#1FDWF37P45EB41379, USN#G31-01001. Mercy 8: make-Ford, model-MPV, year-August 2008, engine- 350 V-8 6.4L, VIN#1FDWF37RX8ED96222, USN#G31-0119A. Mercy 10: make-Ford, model-MPV, year-April 2002, engine-350XLT V-8 7.3L, VIN#1FDWF37F72EC655469, USN#G31-00994. Mercy 11: make: Ford, model-MPV, year-April 2002, engine-350XLT V-8 7.3L, VIN#1FDWF37F52EC65468, USN#G31-00995.

2. (Question): Do you seek quotes for systems delivered and installed and equipment shipped to destination as uninstalled kits?(Answer): The government will only accept quotes delivered and installed in their ambulances at customer's location in Guam. We do not want retrofit kits to be installed by the mechanics here.
3. (Question): Will you not consider quotes for installed and uninstalled?(Answer): The government will only accept quotes delivered and installed in their ambulances at customer's location in Guam.
4. (Question): What document(s) need to be submitted to show the proposed system is listed as acceptable emissions reduction device by OSHA, NIOSH, CARB, or other air pollution control agency to be in compliance with the Scope of Work? (Answer): The government needs an emissions control product, "no smokes", that will contain the diesel exhaust emissions that eminate from our ambulances while they are within the apparatus deck in the interior of the fire station. The exhaust needs to be contained within the system until the vehicle leaves the interior of the fire station and then releases the exhaust into the atmosphere outside the fire station. We are not concerned about containing outside emissions, only inside emissions. 5. (Question): What is the bid closing date? (Answer): Response due date is extended to 15 September 2009, 4:00PM Pacific Time.
6. (Question): This is further confusing to us where there are costs asked to ship to either Tracy California or to Guam?(Answer): Items are to be shipped to Consolidation Point Tracy California.

(End of addendum)

BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1)  PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION MODELS (PDMs) - will be evaluated for the following:

Conformance with the salient characteristics of the description/specification; pass the Shock Attenuation Test and Forefoot Flexibility Test and visual examinations.

2)  PAST PEFORMANCE  will be evaluated for the following:

Relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

3) Price:  For evaluation purposes, all offerors should submit pricing for maximum ordering quantities of 7,500 pairs for each of the five (5) years.  The offerors proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Award under this procurement will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Both factors mentioned above are of equal importance and both factors are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer.  In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer.  Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.arnet.gov; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Feb 2009).  A completed copy of this provision, Offeror Representations and Certifications should be included with the offer.  Offerors are required to submit on-line Reps & Certs (see https://orca.bpn.gov/).  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in their latest editions apply to this solicitation:   52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jun 2008).  The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause:

Note 1:  If submitting other than brand name NB 993, the contractor shall be required to submit for approval a first article lot production in accordance with FAR clause 52.209 which is included in this solicitation.  The first article lot shall include the 100 pairs of tennis shoes (sizes will be provided at contract award).  Approval as used in this paragraph means the contracting officers written notification to the contractor accepting the test results of the first article.  The initial delivery order expected to be awarded at the time of award or shortly thereafter, will execute the first article testing requirement.

Note 2:  Initial delivery of no less than a quantity of 1,000 pairs of tennis shoes within 90 days after approval of first article test and delivery thereafter of no less than a quantity of 1,000 tennis shoes every 60 days after issuance of subsequent delivery orders until delivery is complete.

Note 3:  If you offer other than brand name items identified in this solicitation, you must submit PDM samples and provide adequate information for USCG to determine the equality of the product(s) offered.

Note 4: Offers and pricing should remain valid for a period of 180 days from solicitation close.

Note 6:  Offerors are limited to providing only one proposal each (i.e., product).

Note 7:  The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  
(End of addendum)

BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1)  PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION MODELS (PDMs) - will be evaluated for the following:

Conformance with the salient characteristics of the description/specification; pass the Shock Attenuation Test and Forefoot Flexibility Test and visual examinations.

2)  PAST PEFORMANCE  will be evaluated for the following:

Relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

3) Price:  For evaluation purposes, all offerors should submit pricing for maximum ordering quantities of 7,500 pairs for each of the five (5) years.  The offerors proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Award under this procurement will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Both factors mentioned above are of equal importance and both factors are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602
Washington DC  20593-0001
FAX:  202-475-3904

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695





ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS:

Offerors shall propose firm-fixed prices on a per year basis for the maximum quantities for each year.  Offerors are required to submit Technical (not to exceed 25 pages) and Price Proposals.  If submitting other than brand name NB 993, the technical proposal shall include (a) Brand name, if any; of the proposed product and (b) Make or model number.

This maintenance required by the Department includes the following products and services listed in line item 001. The existing HR/EX/ESD Server infrastructure utilizes Dell platform architecture. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, and to ensure continuing compatibility and interoperability, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. The maintenance provided  see item 3 above for details  includes integral hardware, software, and service products, which augment the existing hardware system. Dell is the only vendor who can provide the specific products and services stated below, which are required to support the existing Dell Servers, precluding consideration of the products and services of any other company. 	Dell provides common images and components with its server platforms  helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity. 	ImageWatch  Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates. 	Block updates  by delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year. 	Image commonality  by reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance. 	Component commonality  The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing. 	Management commonality  Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems. 	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed. 	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (i.e., going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955). 	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive.	Dell Systems Management provides a single tool to manage and monitor the entire enterprise of servers and storage products.
