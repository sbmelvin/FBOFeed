<CONTACT>CLAUDIA M. ARMSTRONG, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: (202) 564-6679, E-Mail: armstrong.claudia@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify large and small business firms that specialize in the coordination, management, and oversight of logistic support services. This includes both logistics management firms and firms with personnel having specialized expertise in identifying resources and  providing logistical support services related to the following: locating facilities and the set up of temporary office space; security, maintenance, oversight of a specific site location; coordination of  food services; providing for housing/lodging; IT & communication support; medical services; office equipment & supplies, shipping, printing, and other support personnel requirements. The EPA requires these logistical support services to support EPA employees and other personnel during emergency responses and/or Incidents of National Significance (INS). The purpose of the Logistical Support Services requirement is to provide logistical support to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs) and other federal officials implementing EPA?s responsibilities as mandated by the National Response Plan (NRP). EPA has recognized the critical need of having the ability to provide immediate housing accommodations, food services, communication capabilities, security, and other support services for personnel responding to emergency situations. Currently, U. S. EPA Region 6 (Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and 65 Tribes) and other Gulf Coast territories are the primary geographical areas for which these services are required.  As essential personnel are deployed throughout Region 6 to devastated areas without electricity, running water, sanitation, shelter, and other facilities for indefinite periods of time, sufficient logistical support services must be made available to ensure the safety and well-being of our response personnel. The requisite logistical support services may be required 24 hours per day, 7 days a week including Federal, Local and State holidays or on an as-needed basis. Support personnel may work on rotational work schedules to maintain coverage.  All personnel shall speak and be able to communicate in the English language. A general description of the types of logistical support services required for this requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and will be posted to the following webpage on or about October 24, 2006: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm# solam under the link entitled, Logistics Support Services Requirement in the Sources Sought section.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this requirement include, but are not limited to the following: 541614 - Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services; 561210 ? Facilities Support Services; 541614 ? Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistic Consulting Services; 541513 ? Computer Facilities Management ; 624210 ? Community Food Services; 621493 ? Emergency Medical Services; 335122 ? Emergency Lighting ; 624221 ? Emergency Shelters; 624230 ? Emergency Relief Services; etc. Please visit the following website to determine appropriate small business size standards http://www.naics.com/sba_sizestandards.htm.  The Government anticipates awarding one Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) and/or a multiple award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for this requirement. The period of performance for each will not exceed five years. Small business concerns interested in this requirement are advised of the language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.219-14 ?Limitations on Subcontracting? paragraph (b)(1) which states that under a small business set-aside contract for services ?at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.?  Therefore, the Capabilities Statement should realistically demonstrate how the small business concern will comply with this clause which would be included in any potential contract.   Please also note that consultants are considered subcontractors and not employees of the prime contractor. Interested firms who believe they have the capability of providing services as defined above and in the SOW are invited to submit a written Capabilities Statement containing sufficient information.  Responses shall clearly demonstrate the firm?s capabilities/expertise with regard to providing logistical support in the areas referenced in the SOW.  All responses shall include a cover letter that states the firm?s legal business name, small business status (e.g.: small, small disadvantaged, minority-owned, 8(a), Hubzone, SDVOSB, WOSB etc), if applicable, and should be submitted via e-mail to: armstrong.claudia@epa.gov or mailed in hard copy mailed to the following address:  (1) U.S. POSTAL SERVICE ADDRESS:  U.S. EPA - Ariel Rios Building  ATTN: Robert M.

This is an unrestricted procurement.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The OPO for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to IBM, 12092 Federal Systems Park Drive, Fairfax, VA 22033 for travel transaction services.  IBM, currently providing similar contracted travel transaction services to DHS/TSA, will require very nominal modification effort to its existing software, to meet the needs of DNDO, and therefore it is in the best interest of the Government, also based on urgency of need in its transition to the USCG financial management system for FY 07 appropriations, to award to IBM.
(ii)	Request for Quote (RFQ) /Solicitation reference is RDND0700012. 
(iii)	The RFQ incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-13 (28 Sep 06).
(iv)	NAICS code is 561990.  Size standard is $6.5M. The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is not applicable.
(v)	CLIN 0001:  Travel transaction fees; 3,585 each.  CLIN 0002:  Travel.  Not-to-Exceed $1210.

DHS/Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) 

3.0	INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain Contractor support services for the operation, use, and maintenance of the Travel & Expense Service (TEServ) System, including functional and technical support, and post payment audit support.  Migration of the DNDO travel functions from the Science and Technology Directorate?s Gelco Travel Manager System to a DNDO-specific version of the current DHS?s TSA (Transportation Security Administration) Gelco Travel Manager System is required.

4.0	BACKGROUND

The DNDO has migrated to the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Core Accounting System (CAS) in fiscal year 2007.  Upon migration, DNDO must use a Travel Management System that can best fit its needs and can interface with CAS.  Since DNDO travelers have used Gelco Travel Manager, it is DNDO?s intent and desire to use a similar application to minimize training issues and reduce support costs.

DNDO will use a service-based system whereby service fees will be paid upon each travel transaction.  The maximum number of travel transactions is based on an estimated usage of 3,485 over a twelve-month period.  




DNDO desires the following functionality:

A web based application.
Compliance with Federal Travel Regulations (FTR).
Pre-trip authorization creation.
Post-trip voucher creation.
Local voucher creation.
Automatic routing for approval.
Error correction.
Sponsor travel capability.
Multiple reporting abilities.
Data export to core financial system.
Audit data file generation.

The service fee will be paid to the Contractor using the Centrally Billed Account (CBA) credit card number.  The application must charge the fee to the respective appropriation code provided on the voucher for other expenses.

At startup, DNDO will require support to setup the system, load respective traveler profiles and accounting code data using a standard file format.  Once the application is set up, DNDO will use its staff for application administration.
TEServ is currently a web-based application that can be accessed from any computer with access to the internet.  The Contractor shall provide technical support services as outlined in Section 5.
