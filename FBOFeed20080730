<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a purchase order to SKC Inc., manufacturer of Aircheck XR5000 air sampling pumps, 4 cell Li-Ion batteries for Aircheck XR5000 pump, multi charger for 4 cell Li-Ion batteries, and calibrator for Aircheck XR5000 air sampling pumps.
<p>The Document Development Branch of NIOSH is currently conducting potential occupational exposure assessments in a variety of workplaces that handle, create or use engineered nano-scale materials. Recently, NIOSH personnel have been asked to measure the air concentrations of extremely small particulate material (10-1000 nanometer scale) during specific nanomaterial production processes. Based on this need, NIOSH requires air sampling pumps that can be used to quantify the nano-scale particulate present in a variety of workplace atmospheres.</p>
<p>There is only one type of air sampling pump that is of the correct size, weight, and capable of drawing air across filter media to allow for the measurement of engineered nanoparticles. This instrument is known as the Airchek XR5000 manufactured by SKC, Inc.</p>
<p>The air sampling pumps must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Have a sampling flow rate range up to 5 Liters per minute (LPM).<br />&bull; Have a run time up to 40 hours at a flow rate of 2 LPM using a high power lithium ion battery.<br />&bull; Have a patented internal flow sensor.<br />&bull; Be able to automatically compensate for air temperature changes.<br />&bull; Have a lockable key pad to prevent tampering.<br />&bull; Have a fault mode that maintains sample time if battery runs low or there is a flow restriction.<br />&bull; Be powered by a high-power lithium ion battery capable of providing power for 40 hours at 2 LPM and 22 hours at 5 LPM.<br />&bull; Have an anti-static plastic case and a particulate trap on the inlet.<br />&bull; Unit must be UL listed and intrinsically safe.<br />&bull; Unit must possess a constant flow compensation feature that can provide a flow rate of 5 LPM at 10 inches of water back pressure, 4 LPM at 20 inches of water back pressure, and 2 LPM at 50 inches of water back pressure.<br />&bull; Unit shall possess a 4-cell, 7.4 volt, 4.4 ampere-hour capacity battery that is rechargeable.<br />&bull; Unit shall be of the following dimensions: 5.5 x 3 x 2.3 inches.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to SKC Inc., under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written product and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward product and pricing information to Diane Meeder, Contract Specialist, Procurement and Grant Branch-V (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email Dmeeder@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all product and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with SKC Inc., 863 Valley View Rd, Eighty Four, PA 15330-8619 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

The NAICS Code for this requirement is 334515, Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals.

<DESC>
The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify, describe, and evaluate potential data environments that could assist in adding value to the FDAs Post market surveillance of medical devices.

Post-market safety surveillance of medical devices is a complex task compounded by rapid dissemination of new medical technology, lack of standards in data collection, and inadequate passive adverse event reporting mechanisms.  While there are Federal and State regulations for reporting adverse events, there is no efficient way to gather and use that data in a way that will provide predictive data rather than old reactive data.

The FDA has identified a computerized tool, DELTA (Data Extraction and Longitudinal Time Analysis system), that can monitor the adverse event rates of new medical devices through the continuous surveillance of clinical outcomes databases using a variety of statistical monitoring tools. The primary objective of this project is to use the existing automated surveillance system and extend that system beyond its current focus on interventional cardiology studies.

The awardee will be required to complete the following tasks:

1.	Study Initiation and Liaison
a.	Identify newly approved medical devices (within 2 years)
b.	Help identify potential collaborating institutions or organizations
c.	Initiate communications and meetings with the FDA Program office
2.	Development of Materials
a.	 Work with the FDA to develop a template for reporting data on newly approved medical devices
i.	I.e., Use profiles, rate of diffusion
b.	Develop or adapt existing data collection tools to allow for categorization based on medical, demographic or other factors.
c.	Modify existing data management needs for specific projects that facilitate quality control, automated data access, accuracy and rapid response.
3.	Problem identification, 
a.	Use statistical processes to develop methods to monitor safety of new cardiovascular devices
b.	Assess what outcomes are optimal for surveillance (in terms of sensitivity, specificity, etc, by device type.)
4.	Quality Control and Reporting
a.	Quality Control of all aspects of data security, data collection and management is crucial.
b.	Provide Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports to the FDA Project Manager in a format that is mutually agreed upon.

The anticipated Period of Performance is a 12 month base period with four option years  from the date of award. The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP). There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation. Competition is expected to be Full and Open. The basis of the award  is Best Value.

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental). The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.

This announcement is not a RFQ. FDA anticipates release of the RFQ on or around August 15 2008 and a subsequent award on 9/22/08.   No other information is available at this time. It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page: http://fedbizopps.gov.

<p>JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-(b)(2) and 13.501(a)(1)</p>
<p>(b)    Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(2) 	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.</p>
<p><br />The Arcturus XT platform provided by Molecular Devices is the sole instrument available which combines both laser capture and laser cutting micro-dissection.  The Arcturus XT instrument will allow users of the Laser Dissection Core Facility, open to the whole intramural NIH research community the most advanced IR laser capture and UV laser cutting instrument. The combination of both micro-dissection types in one platform makes this instrument unique in terms of versatility for different types of tissue and cell micro-dissection. These capabilities give this instrument a much bigger versatility than other instruments which are based only on UV cutting laser.  IR laser is preferable for micro-dissection of very fine targets as individual cells and tumor microenvironment components (stroma).  IR laser also has the advantage that does not damage the bio-molecules, while UV laser damage the bio-molecules under its path, which is a concern in the dissection of fine target or individual cells. In our own scientific research the NCI has been using the capabilities of the IR laser for micro-dissection of tumor-associated stroma in the context of tumor microenvironment studies.  For all these reasons, we believe that IR laser system is essential for many types of applications. To the best of our knowledge the only source that provides IR laser systems is Molecular Devices.  Molecular Devices / MDS Analytical Technologies is the only known source that produces instruments that combine both laser micro-dissection types in one platform and is able to meet all the required characteristics described above.</p>
<p><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(AR)-2008-208-RCO and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26 (as of 06/12/2008).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is set aside for small businesses. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Centers (COAC) on behalf of National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) to procure the services from BioScan, Inc. 4590 MacArthur Blvd. N.W. Washington, D.C. 20007 for the following product and service:

a)	One (1), 330SL Automatic TDCR Liquid Scintillation Counter,  no. HI-425-201, b) on-site installation and training w/ 300SL TDCR, no. HI-INST300

 Summary: 

The above laboratory equipment is essential to NIAMSs continued research efforts:
Background: Laboratory of Muscle Stem Cells and Gene Regulation
 The p300 and PCAF acetyltransferases are nodal coactivators of the muscle specific transcription factor MyoD. MyoD is acetylated by PCAF resulting in an increased transcriptional activity. Acetylation and deacetylation are in a dynamic equilibrium and we have now begun to explore the role of nuclear deacetylases in controlling muscle differentiation. Data generated in our laboratory indicate that the deacetylase HDAC-1 counteracts the ability of MyoD to convert nave fibroblasts to muscle cells and impedes differentiation of cultured mouse myoblasts. The molecular basis of this phenomenon correlates with the ability of HDAC-1 to physically interact with and deacetylate both MyoD and histones surrounding chromatin MyoD-binding sites in undifferentiated myoblasts. Upon induction of cellular differentiation, the tumor suppressor protein pRb is dephosphorylated, engages HDAC-1 and blocks transcription of genes controlled by the transcription factor E2F and required for G1 progression. During this process, HDAC-1 is physically displaced from MyoD to pRB allowing acetylation of MyoD by the acetyltrasferases PCAF thereby promoting transcriptional activation and cellular differentiation. We are now interested in defining the cellular signals regulating the acetylase and deacetylase activities.

Expression profiling of skeletal muscle cells exposed to small molecule inhibitors We have evaluated the effects of global acetylation during muscle differentiation by employing the specific deacetylase inhibitors (DI) sodium butyrate, trichostatin A (TSA), and valproic acid (VPA). Our results indicate that mouse, human myoblasts and mouse developing embryos exposed to a temporally defined regimen of DI display a muscle hypertrophic response as judged by an increase d expression of muscle-specific markers, multinucleation and increased fiber diameter. To identify the molecules mediating the DI effects, we have initiated an expression profiling of cells treated with TSA. We plan to profile muscle gene expression in response to several small molecule inhibitors.

Biochemical Characterization of Proteins Associated with MyoDTo isolate proteins interacting with MyoD we have developed a bicistronic retroviral system for cellular delivery of MyoD. Large quantities of cells are grown and protein purification performed by affinity chromatography using FLAG-immobilized agarose beads. The MyoD-associated factors (MAFs) are identified by mass spectrometry. We have also generated cells expressing a version of MyoD that cannot be acetylated and are interested in determining and compare the pattern of the MAFs isolated using both MyoD 'wild-type' and non-acetylatable MyoD.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">17.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI8284 issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-26.  This acquisition shall be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business concern.  The North American Industry Classification System Code Number 334516, which has a size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure on a sole source basis from Appropriate Technical Resource: two (2) AJ125 Multitron II NC 25mm 115V 60Hz, catalog number I10002; two (2) CO110 Integrated CO2, catalog number L51900; two (2) ATM00 tray w/green squares, catalog I20011; one (1) double stacking kit, catalog number I4000.  The Multitron II is a unique, compact shaking incubator with a patented drive system developed by Infors. A single bearing eccentric moves the main shaft. This results in quiet operation and virtually no vibration. Because movement is transmitted with fewer mechanical components there is less noise and less wear. The traditional design uses 2 idlers and a main shaft to distribute the force; with this design alignment is critical. A misalignment resulting from normal use causes wear and guarantees frequent repairs. The brushless three-phase drive system does not produce black dust contamination inside the unit, common with DC brush motors. The Infors Multitron II/Unitron shaking incubators are the only known environmental shaker that allows CO2 control. The patented drive allows the entire shaking mechanism to be enclosed into the bottom of the case.  As a result, Infors units are smaller and more "air tight" and this allow the units to run in a CO2 controlled atmosphere.  The Multitron II cabinet is constructed of polyurethane.  This material has insulating properties and thus produces faster temperature changes and better uniformity across the shaking table. The installation of two top mounted tangential blowers that eliminate "dead spots" within the cabinet helps maintain the uniformity of temperature throughout the cabinet. Fabricating the cabinets of the Multitron II out of polyurethane allows the customer to use thermoelectric cooling. This type of cooling has the advantage of producing very accurate and uniform temperature control. Also, thermoelectric cooling has no moving parts which makes it more reliable and last longer than the traditional compressor cooled cabinets.   Another distinguishing feature of the Infors shaking incubators is the front-opening design which allows for placement of the unit under a bench. The tray design is also unique in that it may be removed from the front.  The trays are clamped into place and slide out the front of the unit onto the open door for loading or easy removal.  The FOB point shall be Destination.  The government will award a fix priced purchase order to a responsible contractor.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  1) price, 2) warranty, and 3) technical capability to meet required specifications.  Place of delivery:  NIH/NIAID, Bethesda, MD  20892. The following Federal Acquisition Regulations provisions and clauses apply to the acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; Far 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications Commercial Items; Far 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; Far 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.406-7 Central Contractor Registration (2003).  A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representation and Certifications Commercial Items must be included which can be found at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) https://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>
<p>Background: <br />With increased technological advances and the tight budget climate, the agency needs to ensure its needs/requirements are properly defined and resources are applied in a way that gets the best results. The Operations and Services Improvement Process (OSIP) was developed to address this need. OSIP operates on the premise of upfront planning (requirement definition and validation) to ensure that the project is clearly defined and that a feasible solution has been identified. This will ensure that NWS developers develop what is needed, when it's needed, within project costs. To ensure that the requirements are properly elicited from the customers, partners and stakeholders, a requirements training course is needed.</p>
<p>The scope:<br />The three day course materials and presentations should include written and oral presentations for 15 participants on the following:<br />1. Collecting requirements<br />2. Writing good requirement<br />3. Managing requirements <br />4. Requirements validation and verification (The course should place a great deal of emphasis on verification and validation i.e., Requirements Traceability Matrix)<br />Conducting iterative requirements reviews<br />Using metrics to track the requirement process and keeping it fluid<br />5. Brainstorming sessions on requirements management and process improvements<br />Utilization of requirement management tools</p>
<p>The location:<br />The course will be taught at the NOAA Silver Spring Complex in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p>
<p>Dates/Period of Performance:<br />The course shall not begin before August 12, 2008 and must be completed by August 14, 2008.</p>
<p>Deliverables Schedule:<br />*The instructor will supply class materials and notebooks for each class participant on the first day of the course.<br />*NOAA National Weather Service will provide computers, projectors, and writing pads as needed.</p>
<p>Special Requirements:<br />*A certified instructor must be physically present at the designated Silver Spring location to teach the participants. Course materials should explain what participants should know prior to writing requirements for facilitate writing good requirements. The course should include examples and discussions on identifying good requirements. Finally and probably most importantly, the course should include a session on allocation and traceability-validation and verification.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items under FAR Part 13 prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the request for quote for the required items under Request for Quote (RFQ) N61331-08-T-6008. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Quantum 3D Inc of 6330 San Ignacio Blvd, San Jose, CA 95119.  This procurement will be issued using the authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  These listed items are not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  This purchase provides for a quantity of COTS video cards to support fielded Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Command, Control, Communication, Computer, and Navigation (C4N) System Baseline Configuration (SBC) 2(c) systems for interim repair and operational support where the installed cards (part number 991-0904-01) are going end of life. The Quantum 3D Inc video card part number 991-0904-01 is source controlled for SBC 2(c) as documented in NAVSEA source control drawing number 426-7621876-1.  Thus Quantum 3D Inc., as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is the only possible source for the cards going end of life.  For the potential replacements being bought for operational verification (part number 991-0936-01) it is more cost effective to verify that an OEM upgrade to a commercial item will work with the existing system rather than develop an engineering specification to attempt purchase of a completely new item.  
The following are being procured:
CLIN 0001: Twenty-Three (23) each Sentiris Video Cards Part Number 991-0904-01CLIN 0002: Three (3) each Sentiris Video Cards Part Number 991-0936-01

SUB 5252.213-9401 Notice to Prospective Suppliers (Apr 2003)
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  (End of Provision)
SUP 5252.213-9402 Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance-Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (Apr 1999)
ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Under the Authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation, Part 6 Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, the U.S. Census Bureau's Administrative Management Systems Division (AMSD) intends to contract with Gradkell Systems, Inc. (GSI). GSI is a Small Business located at 4910 University Sq Ste2, Huntsville, AL, 35816. The Census Bureau utilizes Gradkell proprietary software to electronically sign travel documents.  The Travel Management Information System Plus (TMIS+), which is part of the Commerce Business Systems (CBS) utilizes Gradkell proprietary software to authenticate users with two-level authentication, and ensure that the traveler is certifying their travel. This software has been in use by the Census Bureau since 1997. The anticipated period of performance will be from September 2008 through September 2010.

Travel Management Information System Plus (TMIS+) is a mature software application used by over 5,000 travelers at the Census Bureau.  TMIS+ provides users the ability to electronically create, process, and track all travel related documents (authorizations, advances and certifications.  

Electronic Signature (ESIG) technology makes TMIS+ a paperless travel system and eliminates much of the work a traveler must do before and after the trip.  The traveler enters estimated costs for this trip including transportation, lodging, per-diem, travel advances, and other travel expenses.  An approving officer then approves the information entered, which exists as records in the Oracle Database Management System, by placing an electronic signature on the data.  Upon return from travel, the traveler enters in the actual expenses for the trip and electronically signs the on-line travel voucher.  The traveler then awaits reimbursement from the financial office.  The financial officers verify the signatures on the documents and audit the data entered before preparing the disbursements to the traveler.

The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capab ilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamlin e its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition ( WIT) barracks and all related Administrative Buildings and Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity ( IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH,  NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Administrative Facilities - The scope consists of but is  not limited to the following administrative facilities as separate or combined tasks:<BR><BR>The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is comprised of administration, special functions, storage and classroom components for personnel assigned to work in those facilities.

Responses are due by 8 August 08.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned. <BR><BR>A.	INTRODUCTION<BR>PM J-AIT provides a single point of contact for procurement and technical expertise across the suite of AIT-enabling technologies.  This support is focused on Total Asset Visibility (TAV) and the integration of products within global supply chains.  PM J-AIT provides automated near real-time accurate data collection, aggregation, and retrieval that enhance information management systems and manages Radio Frequency In-Transit Visibility (RF-ITV) for DoD, NATO, and Coalition Partners in support of expeditionary logistics.<BR>As part of its mission, PM J-AIT evaluates and provides the latest in various types of hardware, software, and services from AIT industry leaders to the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies.  PM J-AIT also provides expertise in systems integration, AIT standards, and professional services to help customers meet requirements and develop customized AIT solutions. <BR>A significant part of PM J-AITs mission is met through the AIT-III contract.  Through this contract PM J-AIT provides hardware, software, and services to Government systems designers and integrators. The hardware provides a common baseline of bar code and micro-circuitry devices for both tactical and non-tactical applications.  Software includes commercially available operating systems, Bar Code Label and Form Design and Printing Software, Application Software Development Kits, Application Generation Software, and Wireless Transaction Support Software.  Services include maintenance, training, technical engineering services, and documentation.<BR>Specifically, AIT-III enables radio frequency data collection and automatic data capture using handheld that send and receive information by radio frequency.  Information from the units is displayed on a screen on the handheld terminal for workers. It also allows real-time, two-way exchange of data between terminals, fixed, mobile, and a host computer at a distant location allowing real-time operations in applications like warehousing, retail, and other process oriented industries.  Radio frequency data collection systems then communicate information from a mobile location to a host computer in real-time. <BR>The environment in which these devices operate can range from warehouse to field locations and must operate under a wide range of variable factors encompassing temperature, humidity, and shock.  The devices are used by a variety of personnel in secured and unsecured areas and are often attached to forklifts or other material handling equipment.  In warehouses, these AIT devices enable rapid information exchange for shipping, receiving, order picking, and stocking operations.<BR>B. PURPOSE <BR>The goal of this RFI is to gather information regarding industry experience and expert advice for the Government's needs as outlined in the Scope and in the questions below.  Industry responses will be used by the Government to refine the scope of the future requirement for the products and services described here. <BR>In reviewing the responses, the Government technical POC may request additional information via email only to gain further insight into the responders technical and manufacturing capabilities. No meetings or teleconferences will be held with the vendors.<BR><BR>Firms are requested to not include marketing informational material that does not relate to the products and services described in this RFI as it will be discarded by the reviewers. <BR><BR><BR>Key information requested:<BR>1.	The US Army requires portable/wearable labeling solutions for shipping and outdoor storage applications.  Currently these applications require 2-inch, 3-inch and 4-inch wide labels resistant to Ultra Violet light (thermal transfer).  The Government seeks sources and product specification sheets and Internet Web sites containing relevant information. <BR>2.	The Government seeks Industry comments on cross-contract integration and criteria by which task orders and prime contracting arrangements can be determined.  That is, the Government envisions the potential for integration of AIT with passive and active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) products that can be acquired from multiple PM J-AIT contract vehicles and multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).  The Government seeks Industrys views on Risk, Management, and Quality factors necessary to minimize the cost of integration.   <BR>3.

<DESC><p>Air Force Subscale Aerial Targets (AFSAT) - BQM-167A Fiber-Optical-Towed-Decoy (FOTD) - The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 691st Armament Systems Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL. The Air Force has a requirement for operation of fiber-optical-towed-decoy (FOTD) on the BQM-167 Subscale Aerial Target. The FOTD is a Government furnished payload, consisting of two wing mounted pods and one extendable/retractable towed decoy that must be integrated into the BQM-167 system under this contract effort. The FOTD system simulates real-world threats using a retrievable and reusable towed decoy. The FOTD system uses the Electronic Attack (EA) System components, already mounted onboard the BQM-167A, to generate all of the Radio Frequency Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) techniques, and then modulates a fiber optic laser for transmission to the trailing decoy. The optical signal is demodulated within the decoy, and the resulting RF signal is amplified and transmitted with the desired spatial separation, i.e. tow length. At the end of the event, the decoy is safely retracted and the target recovered. The towed decoy is approximately 2.4 inches in diameter and 15 inches long. The decoy is housed inside the Tow Reel Pod (55 inches long and 8 inches in diameter) which mounts on the wing of the BQM-167A target and weighs 83.3 pounds (with its mounting hardware). A Ballast Pod will be mounted on the BQM-167A target's right wing to exactly counterbalance the weight, center of gravity (CG) effects, and aerodynamic characteristics of the Tow Reel Pod. The FOTD system's receive antenna is internally mounted within the forward radome of the Ballast Pod. The Air Force has limited developmental funding for this effort. The Government does not own a technical data package and/or software data rights for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties.</p>
<p><br />The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 33641 with a size standard of 1500 employees. Potential offerors who have the capability to provide the FOTD shall submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) no later than 29 August 2008 demonstrating their capability to meet all of the above performance requirements. The SOC shall be limited to 25 pages including attachments. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the government to any specific acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the government for any purpose. As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB FL, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Col Arnold W. Bunch, (850) 882-5422, AAC/CV, 101 West D. Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5422.</p>

Develop, produce and deliver a library of leadership exemplars<BR><BR>Leadership is a multi-dimensional construct that is often hard to articulate precisely.  Good leadership is paramount for successful operations in the armed forces. Young and old leaders alike need to develop and sustain the skills to lead small and large forces in the uncertain, changing situations of todays complex security environment. Leadership is defined by the Army as a process of influence.  As a process, behaviors are central to the concept of leadership, but character, other attributes and experience contribute to leadership outcomes as well. This combination of attributes, behavior and experience is best understood in context of specific situations.  One way to convey what leadership should look like is to portray a leaders actions, his personal attributes and experience in the context of a situation.  Together these elements can be combined into an exemplar that can be produced for successful leader situations.<BR><BR>The task is to create a library of exemplars which convey the lessons of Army leadership as outlined in the components and actions described in Appendix A of FM 6-22 Army Leadership. For inclusion into the library, the stories must meet the basic criteria of a good story. These criteria will be developed by the contractor based on a review of the storytelling and behavioral science literature.  <BR><BR>Requirements of the exemplars and stories. The stories will be a diverse group of varying medium (i.e, written, graphical pictures, video, film).  The intent is for the stories to be concise and clear examples of the varying components of the 56 leadership doctrinal competencies.   The most effective stories will be those in which the evaluation of the moral or lesson is the least explicit, and still would be reliably interpreted.  Complete coverage of every component of leadership doctrine is required. Some stories may cover more than one component, at least three exemplars for each component should be created. The contractor will create three to four intriguing questions that would generate good discussion about the story. The questions should tie the story to Army leadership doctrine and elicit reflection and discussion from the users.  <BR><BR>Additionally, the contractor will develop, conduct and analysis of and report on an empirical evaluation of the leadership exemplars. The empirical evaluation shall support the assessment of how readily the teaching points are understood; whether the teaching points can be recalled; whether particular teaching points are particularly salient. If exemplars do not appear to reliably convey the teaching points, they must be refined or replaced. <BR><BR>Task 2. Combat Training Center Leadership Feedback Tools.  <BR>The mission of the Army Combat Training Center (CTC) Program is to provide realistic and stressful Joint and combined arms collective training for Soldiers, leaders, staffs, and units according to Army and Joint doctrine. <BR>A major purpose behind the start of the CTC is to provide a realistic, challenging environment to train leaders.  Army leaders rate the training value and experience of a CTC training rotation very highly, and they have done this on a consistent basis since at least 2000 when the Army Training and Leader Development Panel started to measure and record reactions to the set of Army leader development practices.   When asked about the development of leadership abilities during a CTC rotation, the ratings are not as universally high.  When asked how effective were your CTC experiences for improving your leadership skills, 30% of the active component responses of those who had been to a CTC rotation were either neutral (21%) or ineffective (9%).<BR>  In the 1980s a tool was provided to NTC observer/controllers, called the Shaler card, that provided a framework for observing and recording leadership behaviors of key leaders in a unit rotation.  <BR>The task shall determine the extent of current usage of the Shaler card or similar leadership observation tool.  The contractor shall determine the extent that leadership observation is done in the NTC, JRTC and BCTP programs;   gather evidence by examining training materials for observer controller/training  and analyze the variety of ways that leadership has been and is currently trained and observed during a rotation to identify the opportunities and constraints of the CTC training program in which to integrate tools for leadership feedback. The contractor shall develop observation techniques for O/C/Ts to use to collect information on key leaders and their actions and to prepare and present individual feedback to each observed leader.  The contractor shall take the prototype tools and conduct simulated experiments (similar to gedankenexperiment) to identify strengths and needed changes before transition to actual use by CTC O/C/Ts.  A second round of testing of the tools shall be performed, obtaining feedback from CTC O/C/Ts and trained leaders.<BR><BR>Task 3. Leadership Influence Behaviors and Guidelines.<BR>Influence is a central concept to the Armys definition of leadership.  FM 6-22 identifies 10 techniques for conveying influence.  Influence is the basic skill required in providing Soldiers direction and motivation, in negotiations with multinational parties, in interactions with joint interagency, intergovernmental and multinational (JIIM) players, and across organizations to secure support for the leaders unit. These doctrinal techniques are based on Yukls research related to commitment, compliance and resistance.  Other theoretical and practical models of influence exist. French and Raven (1959) outline a model of interpersonal power that guided future empirical work in the area of influence.  Raven (1992) develop the power/interaction model of interpersonal influence that shows the relation between power and influence (power is potential influence, influence is kinetic power). Kipnis (1976) extended the study of influence by incorporating consideration of setting when studying uses and types of influence. Carlson, Carlson and Wadsworth (2000) outlined several individual, group and task characteristics that may be related to the outcome of an influence attempt. Tactics used in organizational influence attempts have been categorized by Kipnis, Schmidt, and Wilkinson (1980) and refined by Yukl and Falbe (1990). Cialdini focused his influence model on methods that gain compliance. Knowles & Linn (2004) extend the literature on influence by investigating methods of influence that deal more directly with recognizing and understanding resistance.<BR>The contractor shall review the relevant literature to create a unifying theory of job influence.  The contractor shall collect and analyze data on leader influence techniques that are used in their jobs. The contractor shall develop a concise handbook on issues and techniques involved in leader influence. Influence shall be treated as the basic function, with negotiation, conflict resolution, partnering, alliance-building, etc. as special cases of influence. Potential antecedents to the use of influence, factors (e.g, report and trust) that support the gaining of influence, should be considered in the handbook. Moderating conditions (such as power relationships, cultural differences, legitimate authority, character, scope, perceived expertise, and time horizon) will be addressed in the theory and in the guidelines provided in the handbook.   The contractor shall give special consideration to how an Army leader determines how other parties are trying to influence him and how he should respond.<BR><BR>The contractor shall perform an in-depth review of influence theories and develop a hybrid theory to guide data collection and training materials provided in a Handbook format.  Plans for data collection shall be constructed to determine natural influence behaviors of Army leaders in multiple situations.  A learning approach shall be developed from the theoretical and empirical research.  The learning approach will be turned into practical guidelines for Army leaders to learn how to influence in a wide variety of situations.  The guidelines should be consistent with a leader as a rational decision maker who weighs various costs and benefits of the different influence strategies before invoking one of them to influence the recipient.  Guidelines should also encourage a consideration of possible consequences of an influence attempt.<BR><BR><BR>This is not request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. No solicitation is currently available at this time.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Boaz Consultancy, Korte Leidsedwarsstraat 105, Amsterdam, Netherlands to provide programming services for Enhancements to the PQLX System.
The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition:
The U.S. Geological Survey, National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) Geological Hazards team, Central Region, requests award of a non-competitive procurement to Boaz Consultancy to continue development and maintenance of the PQLX software system.
The PQLX software system is installed and operational at two USGS seismic facilities (NEIC and Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL)) for routine daily monitoring and QC of real-time seismic data. In addition, the PQLX system is being used for long-term maintenance and monitoring of seismic station meta-data for the Global Seismograph Network (GSN) and the Advanced National Seismic Network (ANSS). The PQLX system requires continued maintenance as new data types are encountered from contributed networks and as unknown compression formats are encountered in older data. Also, continued development in reporting system results to potential users is required.
The proposed contractor, Richard Boaz of Boaz Consultancy, offers unique qualifications in the following areas that are considered essential to the requirement. Richard Boaz was hired as a contractor to develop the USGS PDF algorithm into an operational class program to run on the BUD system at the IRIS DMC and for the ANSS NEIC in Golden. In addition in the PDF phase 3 contract the PDF system was fully integrated with the PQL data viewing software system and mySQL database. Since Richard Boaz coded all phases of the system at the ANSS NEIC, he would be the obvious choice for further development of the PQLX system. 
Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOT A SOLICITATION
<p>RFI REFERENCE NUMBER - AFRL07300801</p>
<p>The government is requesting information from companies working on High-Frequency, sky-wave, Over the Horizon Radar (OTHR) Technology. The Government is interested in receiving information from systems vendors as well as key component vendors whose technology is useful in the development of a Next Generation Over-the-Horizon Radar (NGOTHR). The Government wishes to assess the potential for Over-the-Horizon Radar contributions to fill wide area surveillance gaps in North American defense and security.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Persistent, wide-area air and maritime surveillance of the approaches to North America has been a long-standing requirement for North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) defense missions, and also supports Department of Homeland Security missions. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council validated the homeland defense surveillance gaps identified in the NORAD Homeland Air and Cruise Missile Defense Joint Capability Document in November 2005. The USAF Integrated Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment and the Air and Missile Defense Advisory Panel have each cited the potential of exploiting recent advances that could make NGOTHR an essential component of an effective and affordable family of systems to meet the persistent, wide-area surveillance needs. A family of systems approach to addressing wide area surveillance gaps is expected and NGOTHR is a key wide area surveillance cueing system in that approach.</p>
<p>Current generation OTHR needs additional sensitivity and improved suppression of noise and clutter to process the full range of missions in today's threat environment. Expanded 24/7/365 capabilities are also desired to meet operational requirements. Research over the last 20 years indicates that a NGOTHR has potential to mitigate noise and spread-Doppler clutter sensitivity problems by exploiting two-dimensional transmit and receive configurations, advanced digital components, and advanced signal processing techniques.</p>
<p>Prior to embarking on a large scale NGOTHR development in the US, a combination of tests and analysis are planned to support recommendations on the architecture for a NGOTHR system. A Technology Risk Reduction Initiative (TRRI) will bring together the U.S. OTHR community to define risks, develop concepts, and mature technologies. Successful completion of the TRRI will lead to the implementation of an NGOTHR Joint Concept Technology Demonstration (JCTD) or other acquisition-related activity. Key activities and objectives for the TRRI are</p>
<p>1. To develop a roadmap for a robust multi-mission NGOTHR capability for the U.S.</p>
<p>2. Validate performance of key radar hardware and software components expected in a NGOTHR capability.</p>
<p>3. Provide a high-fidelity OTHR modeling and simulation capability</p>
<p>4. Conduct tests, data collections, and analyses to evaluate performance of two-dimensional transmit and receive array configurations, key radar hardware and software components, waveforms and adaptive beam-forming, and other promising signal processing techniques.</p>
<p>5. Collect pertinent cost data for preparing rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for planning , affordability, and life cycle cost assessments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NORAD/USNORTHCOM Integrated Priority List (IPL) specified the operational requirements for wide area surveillance. The TRRI team is initiating a roadmap for maturing NGOTHR and for determining the performance capabilities of the new technology against the gaps. The TRRI is planned for FY08 and FY09.</p>
<p>As the government team develops a roadmap for a robust multi-mission NGOTHR capability for the U.S., we are interested in inputs from industry. We are performing a market survey of NGOTHR technology, both system level as well as critical technology elements. This RFI will be used by the TRRI team in the development of the NGOTHR roadmap.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support NGOTHR roadmap development, to assess OTHR architecture tradeoffs, to identify technology risks and maturation strategies, to estimate the level of investment required over the next 5 years, and to determine industries interest in participating in the development of a NGOTHR capability. The potential developers should understand that firm requirements for a NGOTHR system have not been defined at this time. Requirements will evolve and are tied to user needs, technology maturation, concept of operation, and cost as an independent variable. <br /><br />The TRRI team will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to understand the current state of the art in OTHR technology.</p>
<p>The Government is interested in receiving information from companies working on OTHR system technology and from component vendors whose subsystems and critical components are useful in the development of the OTHR system. The Government will accept partial responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>We solicit the interest of vendors, organizations and/or consortia with OTHR expertise in one or more of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. System architectures<br />2. Hardware components<br />3. Software development and maturity<br />4. Radar Propagation and Performance modeling <br />5. HF antenna array design<br />6. Test methods<br />7. Signal processing methods<br />8. Target localization and accuracy improvement including altitude estimation methods</p>
<p>This expertise shall include the ability to prepare ROM cost estimates and implementation schedules for the development, production, and sustainment of any of the above areas that apply.</p>
<p>DATA SUBMITTION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The information package should include the following items that are applicable to the submitter:</p>
<p>1. Statement of interest, either system developer or critical technology elements.<br />2. Description of qualification:<br />Projects<br />Products<br />3 Identify what you feel are the critical gaps in performance of existing capability. Define radar architecture as a function of mission/target types and identify critical technology elements. Describe existing or emerging technologies that will allow filling the capability gaps.

<SUBJECT>Automatrix System Update
<SOLNBR>PR-194822
<RESPDATE>080808
<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture  Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) anticipates a sole source (name brand) procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following requirement: service, controller update/replacement, system review, checkout and system-wide backup of American Auto-Matrix building automation system.   

The service needs to be performed by a trained and certified Auto-Matrix specialist.  
McClure Company has been the factory authorized American Auto-Matrix brand automatic temperature control (ATC) systems provider for USDA since April of 2001.  Auto-Matrix has divisional territories that prevent dealers of their product from competing against one another.  In agreement with these territories, they have set pricing for their product. As a result, McClure Company has been the only authorized Solutions Integrator (dealer) working on NPGQCs Auto-Matrix building automation systems BAS) for the past 7 year.   Because McClure is the authorized dealer, it is not possible to use another company to service the Auto-Matrix product.  The circuitry within the smart panels located throughout the facility is software driven.  The database created and programmed by McClure Company is not fully compatible with other building control systems manufacturers such as Siemens or Honeywell.  A Siemens chiller controller or boiler sequencing program is not compatible with the Auto-Matrix system and would not function.  At this time there are no common software protocols between these building automation systems which would allow for the competitive pricing.  As a result, any new or replacement component to the building automation system must be American Auto-Matrix.  Lastly, an authorized Auto-Matrix technician is needed in order to not void any warranties that are associated with the building automation system.  

Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent supply listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office.  Small business concerns are encouraged to participate.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, but instead a market research method to determine interested sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive (i.e., non-brand name) procurement.  No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this supply and service along with your Statement of Capability.   The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide.  Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please email Statements of Capability Nathan Johnson Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  Closing date for submission of Statements of Capability is August 8, 2008 at 3:00 p.m. CST.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 238220 with a small business size standard of less than 13 million.

<SOLNBR>W9124708T0166
<ARCHDATE>10282008
<CONTACT>Brandon Antonio Hawkins, 910-907-5144

<a href="mailto:brandon.a.hawkins@us.army.mil">ACA, Fort Bragg</a>
<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Fort Bragg, North Carolina intends to award, on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a contract to Laerdal Medical Corporation, 167 Myers Corners Road, Wappingers Falls, NY 12590-3827, for Medical Simulators. This procurement is to include the acquisition of both the Laerdal Virtual I.V. system and the SimMan 3G Patient Simulator.  Market research has revealed that the Laerdal Virtual I.V. arm simulator is a one of kind device not made by any other company. In addition to the uniqueness of the apparatus used, this system is also the only computer aided I.V. simulator.  The addition of a computer screen allows the Student to see where they are inserting the catheter from both an internal and external prospective. The Laerdal system also has software specifically tailored for use by military students. This product allows for a realistic training environment while also allowing a margin of error for the typical student which usually experiences anxiety or nervousness while perfecting this skill. There are other low-fidelity mannequins available in the market but they do not provide as realistic a training experience. The mannequins are not as an effective training tool because a Student can tell where to insert the catheter based on where previous Students have left a mark. Also, a virtual apparatus substantially decreases the cost of maintaining and replenishing training equipment and medical supplies.<BR><BR>In addition to the Laerdal I.V. arm simulator, this award will also include the SimMan 3G Patient Simulator which is a tetherless mannequin.  As with the I.V. simulator, the tetherless mannequin is a more effective training tool which simulates a more realistic training environment than comparable products. The tetherless mannequin allows the Student to treat and transport the same mannequin. Alternative mannequins which are available are tethered and require the Student to treat one mannequin and then move to another mannequin to continue the simulation as if it is the same patient. The SimMan 3G Patient Simulator also allows the Instructor to control the mannequin at a distance and evaluate the student without having to be in his or her immediate proximity. This allows the student to react as he or she would in an actual combat situation. The available tethered alternatives require that the Instructor be next to the student in order to evaluate his performance and control the mannequin. This then becomes a negative training for the Soldier because this is not how he would react in combat. The only comparable product that does not have these deficiencies is the METI iStan which is extremely costly (over $150K just for the mannequin itself). This product is still in the testing phases and is currently being pilot tested by other training centers. <BR><BR>It is the mission of the 18th ABC Surgeon Office to effectively train Soldiers to be competent and confident in all the medical skills they may need to render in combat. Both of these products will greatly assist in facilitating a realistic simulated learning environment in which the Soldiers can develop the competencies and confidence necessary to perform these skills without sacrificing the well-being of an actual patient. This is not a request for Competitive Proposals. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. If you feel your firm possesses the ability to provide these supplies, you must respond by demonstrating your firms technical capability to meet the requirement. If no affirmative written response is received, the supplies will be awarded without further notice. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the email address provided below no later than 05 August 2008, 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time. POC for this notice is Brandon Hawkins, Email: brandon.a.hawkins@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT 					Solicitation Number: 08SP308125
Action: Special Notice
Response Date: 08/8/2008
PSC: R499
Point of Contact:  Beth A. Murray, Contracting Officer, 702-293-8581
The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a contract to Hartman Valve Corporation, 700 Capac Court, Saint Louis, MO  63125. This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by August 8, 2008 may be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government has made the determination that it would be in the best interest to sole source this effort to the Hartman Valve Corporation. It is the Government's belief that only Hartman Valve Corporation can provide the required services for the following reasons:  the stainless steel seat rings installed on these butterfly valves at Hoover Dam were designed to accept the rubber seal system required in this procurement.  This acquisition requires manufacturing of seals, installation materials, and installation technical support complying with Hartman Valve Corporation drawings.  Seals manufactured in accordance with these drawings are covered by one or more claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,202,983B1 entitled "Valve seal structured to prevent circumferential slippage".  The plant outage condition creates a rare opportunity for replacement of these seals since this pipe will not be drained (making the work possible) for the next 8 to 12 years.  The water pipe supplying water to the units is scheduled to be re-filled in October 2008.  The intent of this acquisition is to complete repairs to the butterfly valve seals prior to re-filling the pipe.  The tasks to be accomplished include:  Provide a license to use this patented seal design on the valve.  Provide resilient butterfly valve seals per valve in accordance with HVC drawing 102030-101 or 102030-103 depending on valve size.  Provide HVC Engineering Process Bulletin EPB102030 defining the seal installation procedure.  Provide all material required for the installation of the resilient valve seals. Provide an MSDS for every chemical to be used. Provide 2 man-days of technical support per valve during the installation of the seals by the Government, including inspection of the finished installation, after closing the butterfly valve on the new seal.
Anticipated award date is August 9, 2008.  For questions, please contact Beth A. Murray at (702) 293-8581 or email bmurray@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 332911 - Industrial Valve Manufacturing, the size standard is 500 or less employees.

<DESC>This is not a request for quotations or proposals.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigragtion & Customs Enforcement (ICE), intend to negotiate and award a purchase order to Meggitt Training Systems, Inc (MTSI), to upgrade the current Caswell range target equipment to a Caswell Rangemaster 10K.  The objective of this project is to ensure safe operating conditions for Law Enforcment Personnel during training and certification activities.  MTSI will supply and install two Rangemaster 10,000 target control systems as the existing two twelve lane ranges in Alexandria, VA.  The following items will be included for each range: 1) New base station computer with touch screen monitor, keyboard and software for the RM10K systems to operate the existing CBN target systems; 2) Remote Tablet module to allow the operation and programming of the down range targets while down range; 3) On-site labor to make the switch over and to train the staff in the operation and use of the new equipment; 4) A set of operation and maintenance manuals for the new equipment.  
No other company can install the RangeMaster 10K into an existing RangeMaster system.  To have another company install a wireless system would require the complete replacement of the range control system vs the upgrade.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541512. 
The Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 8.405-6 (b), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (Limited Source Justification and Approval).  
The Period of Performance is September 15, 2008 - September 19, 2008.

Written responses must not exceed three (3) pages and must be received no later than 11:00 AM EDT on August 6, 2008, to email address: elaine.foster@dhs.gov.  Evidence submitted should clearly demonstrate the vendor's ability to provide the requisite services and the price for doing so.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a comeptitive basis.  No solicitation document exists and requests for such will not be considered. As a result of analyzing the responses to this synopsis of intent, the Contracting Officer may determine that a solicitation will be issued, but no additional synopsis will be published.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">Description<br />1. This announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2009 (CWID 2009) scheduled for 1 June 2009 - 26 June 2009. Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services and Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DoD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States (U.S.) must submit all Trial proposals for CWID by 15 September 2008. Industry partners must have a C/S/A or non-DoD government agency acting as a sponsor to submit a trial. Complete CWID program details, to include references and submission instructions for trials, are found at http://www.cwid.js.mil.<br />2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event enabling the C/S/As, and the multinational community to identify, investigate, and assess command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions which focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing Coalition, COCOM, Service, Agency (C/C/S/A) interoperability and information sharing while exploring new partnerships. U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), on behalf of the Chairman, is responsible for the oversight of the CWID program. CWID focuses on net-centric solutions to current C4ISR capability gaps that the traditional DoD acquisition process is not adequately addressing. Gaps are identified in the annual CWID objectives and reflect immediate and near term capability needs. C/S/A's and industry partners can nominate/submit potential technology solutions to be demonstrated at CWID to address specific acquisition program objectives. Each proposed technology demonstration is called a "trial." CWID provides Technical/Interoperability, Warfighter/Operator, and Information Assurance assessments on trials submitted within the construct of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System. C/S/As are highly encouraged to explore solutions to broad interoperability challenges between participating services, agencies and international participants during the CWID 2009 event. CWID is also an appropriate venue for spiral development, risk reduction, or validation of fielded/near-fielded commercial and/or DoD systems when appropriate to reduce development/demonstration costs or production timelines.<br />3. USJFCOM is the host COCOM for CWID 2009 and influences the simulated operational scenario to address the range of C/C/S/A challenges. The scenario focuses on exercising military coalition task force (CTF) responsibilities in conjunction with U.S. Northern Command's (USNORTHCOM) Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HS/HD) initiatives, and increasing/enhancing involvement, integration, and interoperability with our coalition partners. Coalition participation remains the cornerstone of CWID 2009 and the anticipated international participants include: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO. COCOMs may invite nations, with prior Joint Staff approval, from within their respective AOR to participate as CTF members. USNORTHCOM's coalition partners include US and Canadian military, government and civil agencies (e.g., Department of Homeland Security, Canada Command, and Public Safety Emergency Preparedness Canada).<br />4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for the assessing of C4ISR solutions. Trials may receive one or more of the following assessments: Warfighter/Operator, Technical/Interoperability, and/or Information Assurance assessment. Trials must address one or more of the provided objectives and specifically, focus on at least one narrowly defined sub-objective. The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG) selects and prioritizes trials based on inputs from the CWID Assessment Working Group (AWG), Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG) and the Trial Transition Information Working Group (T2IWG). Performance results captured during the execution phase assessments are documented in the CWID 2009 Final Report. <br />5. As stated above, each proposed trial must address one or more of the CWID objectives and corresponding sub-objectives listed in paragraph 7 to be selected for participation and must commit to provide the funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, and documentation necessary to participate at one or more execution sites. The CWID SMG will select trial proposals on how well the trial's proposal satisfies the chosen objectives and corresponding sub-objectives. The selection criteria are specified in the CWID Additional Information document. Trials must have a DoD or government sponsor in the format outlined on the CWID web site. <br />6. Trial information is transmitted across the Combined Federated Battle Lab Network (CFBLNet), a worldwide secure network, enabling classified, releasable data to be exchanged among the CFBLNet participants. The CWID JMO coordinates, engineers, and supervises the network and the information domains for the worldwide venue. The CWID 2009 hardware and software trials must support the overall Network Centric Warfare construct. The CFBLNet, which supports military and coalition operations, provides the infrastructure to facilitate the military's role in providing Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). <br />7. The 2009 Objectives, initiated by USJFCOM, are supported by sub-objectives that reference clearly defined C/C/S/A capability gaps. The objectives are linked to COCOM Integrated Priority Lists, DoD Joint Capability Areas, the USJFCOM Transformation Roadmap, USJFCOM C2 Capability Portfolio Management (C2 CPM) initiative and other coalition, service requirements and Joint Staff source documentation. The objectives reflect the following recurring themes:<br />a. Investigate and identify emerging and relevant coalition information sharing solutions, <br />b. Focus on demonstrating interoperability solutions for C/C/S/A capability gaps and challenges, and<br />c. Enhance multinational, Joint, and inter-agency cooperation and communication capabilities.<br />The CWID 2009 Objectives and their associated sub-objectives represent process improvements to facilitate post-CWID execution efforts that facilitate strategies aimed at responsibly bringing technology solutions to the DoD and Federal acquisition communities for consideration. Multinational (to include DoD and non-DoD entities) information sharing solutions should be built on a foundation that is web-enabled, net-centric, secure, scalable, and bandwidth sensitive. The CWID 2009 Objectives: <br />Objective 1: Improve Coalition Command, Control and Coordination for both Conventional and Irregular Warfare Operations<br />a. Demonstrate real time voice and text translation tools<br />b. Demonstrate multi-domain applications that promote information sharing with unanticipated mission partners<br />c.

The proposal contains an adequate management plan describing the offeror's approach to management organization, responsibility, lines of authority, management of consultants or subcontractors, and procedures for tracking project progress, risks, problems, and time, and availability and accessibility of project staff for meeting and interaction with NIOSH as needed. (Weight: 10 points).</p>
<p>Past Performance (+4 - 0):</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar work. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offeror's relative ranking will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government may contact other references than those identified by the offeror and the information received will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>a.) All Offerors shall submit a separate record of the past performance information as requested below as along with this RFQ packet. The information may be submitted prior to other parts of the proposal in order to assist the Government in commencing past performance evaluations. The offeror should include the last three (3) contracts completed during the past three years and all or at least three (3) contracts currently in process for both the offeror and for all proposed major subcontractors, which are similar in nature to this requirement.</p>
<p>1.) The Contracts listed may include those with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers, which are of similar scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for predecessor companies, corporate officers, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. The following information should be included for each contract listed:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization;<br />2. Contract Number;<br />3. Brief description of relevance to the services required under this RFP;<br />4. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail address (if known) and facsimile numbers of the Contracting Officer and the Project Officer for all Government contracts. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and facsimile numbers of private sector contacts equivalent of a Federal Government Contracting Officer and Project Officer (operation manager);<br />5. The dollar value of the contract;<br />6. Contract type (Firm-fixed price, cost-plus-fixed-fee, etc.);<br />7. Period of Performance;<br />8. Place of performance;</p>
<p>b.) Offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts and subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from references.<br /><br />1.) Offerors may provide information on problems encountered and corrective actions taken on the identified contracts and subcontracts.</p>
<p>2.) References that may be contacted by the Government include the contracting officer, program manager/project officer, or the administrative officer identified above.<br /><br />3.) If no response is received from a reference, the Government will make an attempt to contact another reference identified by the offeror, to contract a reference not identified by the offeror, or to complete the evaluation with those references who responded. The Government shall consider the information provided by the references, and may also consider information obtained from other sources, when evaluating an offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>4.) Attempts to obtain responses from references will generally not go beyond two telephonic messages and/or written requests from the Government, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. The Government is not obligated to contact all of the references identified by the Offeror.</p>
<p>c.) If negative feedback is received from an offeror's reference, the Government will compare the negative response to the responses from the offeror's references to note differences. A score will be assigned appropriately to the offeror based on the information. The offeror will be given the opportunity to comment, if that information makes a difference in the Government's decision to include the offeror in or exclude the offeror from the competitive range. Any past performance deficiency or significant weakness will be discussed with offerors in the competitive range during discussions. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>d.) Offerors must send Client Authorization Letters (Attachment D) to assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation. Offeror's are encouraged to consolidate requests whenever possible (i.e., if the same reference has several contracts, send that reference a single notice citing all applicable contracts). Offerors may send Client Authorization Letter electronically to references with copies forwarded to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>1.) If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, an offeror must affirmatively state it possesses no relevant past performance history.</p>
<p>2.) Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or e-mailed to individual references as early as possible, but no later then three (3) working days after proposal submission. The offeror should forward a copy of the Client Authorization Letter to the contracting officer simultaneously with mailing references.</p>
<p>e.) Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determination and as an evaluation factor for award. The Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment C) will be used to collect information on an offerors past performance under existing and prior contracts/subcontract for services similar in scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement in order to evaluate offerors consistent with the past performance evaluation set forth below. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance. Evaluation of past performance information will be reflected in terms of the following degrees of performance assessment:</p>
<p>+4 Excellent: A significant majority of the sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was superior and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the offeror again. Complaints are negligible or unfounded. No doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+3 Good: Most sources of information state that the offeror's performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would willingly do business with the offeror again. Complaints, though perhaps well-founded, are few and relatively minor. Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+2 Neutral: Either no past performance history exists for the corporation, predecessor companies, key personnel, or major/critical subcontractors, or the offeror's record of past performance was neither predominantly favorable nor unfavorable. Sources of information are roughly divided over the quality of the offeror's performance. While some state that they would do business with the offeror again, others are doubtful or would not. Complaints are balanced by reports of good work. There is no performance record for the offeror.</p>
<p>+1 Marginal: Many sources of information made unfavorable reports about the offeror's performance and either express serious doubts about doing business with the offeror again or state that they would refuse to do so. However, there are some favorable reports, and some sources of information indicate that they would do business with the offeror again. There are many significant, serious, and well-founded complaints, but there are some reports of very good performance. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+0 Poor: A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was entirely unsatisfactory and that they would not do business with the offeror again under any circumstances. Customer complaints are substantial or numerous and are well-founded. The offeror either has presented no persuasive evidence of having taken appropriate corrective action that will guard against such conduct in the foreseeable future, or it appears unlikely that the corrective action will be effective. Serious doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>f.) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past performance will be maintained in the official contract file.</p>
<p>g.) In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>B. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>C. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />FAR 52.216-1 Type of Contract (Apr 1984)</p>

<DESC><p>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12, Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation includes the provisions and clauses of the FAR through FAC 05-26 dated 6/2/08. This request is being advertised as a request for quote: Request for Quote (RFQ) Number FTCERF29-81213 for the Advertising Literacy Campaign in support of the Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Division of Consumer and Business Education (DCBE) - NJ-2267, 600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20580. The type of contract anticipated to be awarded from this combined synopsis/solicitation is a Time and Materials, Level-of-Effort, Performance Based Service Contract with a base contract period of one year with 3 option periods of 1 year each. This solicitation is not set aside. Agency Overview: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid them. The FTC maintains a website, www.ftc.gov, and a national toll-free telephone line (1-877-FTC-HELP) to respond to requests for information and accept consumer complaints. As the nation's consumer protection agency, the FTC, through its Division of Advertising Practices, enforces truth-in-advertising laws, monitors and develops effective enforcement strategies for new advertising techniques and media, such as word-of-mouth marketing; monitors and reports on the advertising of food to children, including the impact of practices by food companies and the media on childhood obesity; and monitors and reports on industry practices regarding the marketing of violent movies, music, and electronic games to children. Building on that expertise, the FTC, through its Division of Consumer and Business Education (DCBE), will develop an interactive campaign dealing with advertising that would teach tweens and the adults in their lives to be more discerning consumers of information. DCBE produces and disseminates objective, practical and plain language information to consumers, and has created a network of partners and intermediaries that includes public agencies at the federal, state and local levels, industry associations, and non-profit and advocacy organizations. The issues covered range from identity theft to online safety; green marketing to health claims; from telemarketing fraud to phishing - and include a soon-to-be launched website to explain the FTC to kids ages 10-14. The agency is a trusted brand for consumers and businesses, and has an excellent reputation among media outlets for the "news" of the day, as well for the "news people can use." In building out this particular campaign, the FTC is seeking guidance from a contractor with experience and expertise in reaching youngsters, as well as their parents and educators. We recommend that contractors review the FTC's consumer education materials for an understanding of the many issues the FTC manages. These sites are available at www.ftc.gov/bcp/consumer.shtm. Contractors also should review the following education campaign web sites and products for an appreciation of the latest initiatives and strategies implemented: 1) Consumer education video on how to avoid ID theft www.ftc.gov/idtheft; 2) Interactive games and quizzes about Internet safety www.onguardonline.gov/quiz/index.html; 3) Phishing videos: www.youtube.com/user/FTCvideos; 4) Teaser sites: www.wemarket4u.net/fatfoe/index.html, www.wemarket4u.net/glucobate/index.html; 5) Teen drinking prevention: www.dontserveteens.gov/ ; 6) E-cards: Phishing, www.ftc.gov/phishing, Father's Day Phishing www.ftc.gov/dad, Mother's Day www.ftc.gov/mom, Work-at-home scams www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/multimedia/ecards/bizopps/fairytale/index.html; 7) Business guidance: Web-based tutorial for businesses about protecting personal information http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/multimedia/interactive/infosecurity/index.html Scope of Work: Advertising in America is a multi-billion dollar a year business. Truthful advertising provides consumers with the information they need to make better-informed purchasing decisions. It also gives companies an incentive to include features in their products that consumers want. Children have tremendous spending power. For example, tweens spend about $51 billion annually, and their parents and family members spend an additional $170 billion on them. More than a third of parents with children between the ages of six and 11 in the household say that their children can significantly influence their purchasing decisions. By some estimates, American companies are spending $10-12 billion a year on advertising and marketing related to youth 2-18 (including ads targeted to adults for youth-related products and services). Recognizing this, advertisers and marketers have made children a focal point of advertising and marketing programs. For example, it has been estimated that, each year, the average American child between the ages of two and 11 sees 25,600 television commercials. About 22 percent of these ads are for food; 29 percent promote other TV programs; 8 percent are for games, toys, and hobbies; another 8 percent are for screen and audio entertainment; and 3 percent are for OTC medicines. Children as young as three recognize brand logos, with brand loyalty influence starting at age two. About 53 percent of tweens and 29 percent of teens report that they try to buy products that they've seen on TV or in the movies. Given this phenomenon, the FTC proposes to develop an interactive campaign focused on advertising literacy. The campaign will educate children aged 8-12, and the adults in their lives, to be more discerning consumers of information. The FTC seeks to be neither pro- nor anti-advertising; rather, it wants to help kids better understand advertising. The goals of the campaign are to raise awareness of advertising and marketing messages; increase knowledge of how to skillfully read, analyze, and understand an advertisement; and demonstrate the benefits of being an informed consumer. The content of the campaign will be provided by the FTC, and be based upon the agency's experience with the subject matter, a public workshop to be held in 2008-2009, and the experiences of a network of partners. Resources available for this campaign are funds for this contract and FTC staff time; there is no separate budget for advertising. Central to the campaign are some common-sense questions to help young people use critical thinking skills to become savvy consumers in today=s media-rich world: 1) Who is responsible for the ad? Kids should know that whoever is responsible for an ad will have a goal in mind, and that will influence the message in the ad. 2) What is the ad actually saying? This may be obvious in a traditional commercial or print ad, but can be less so in other forms of advertising, including games, product integration, or mobile marketing. The campaign will show kids how to decode and deconstruct ads, no matter what form they take, to find the basic message directed to them. 3) Why is the ad there? The campaign will ask kids to think about the call to action in the ad, and what the advertiser wants them to do. Once exposed to those central messages, the target audience(s) should understand that ads are constructed to give them information and to persuade them to take some action - whether it=s doing something to help themselves or society, being more aware of an issue, buying a particular product, or something else. While the focus of the campaign is on advertising and marketing - helping young people and their parents analyze advertising messages - the critical thinking skills that are central to the campaign, and that kids are learning in other contexts, will be helpful as they interact with all kinds of media throughout their lives. The FTC is seeking a contractor to provide a variety of services in support of this campaign to empower children and their parents to be more discerning consumers of information. The contractor shall demonstrate experience: 1) developing successful interactive, multi-media, web-based methods for communicating with young audiences; 2) developing curricula to deliver content to young people; 3) developing engaging, inviting and appropriate materials to deliver content to young people; and 4) successfully marketing this information to young people, whether through media or through developing partnerships with influential organizations (schools, libraries, other organizations). Target Audiences: The primary audience for this campaign is youngsters aged 8-12. The advertising industry itself talks of the buying power - and influence - of this cohort, and continues to find new ways to reach them, including viral marketing, "advergaming", and other interactive media. In addition, both research and observation tell us that children experience media differently than adults; in fact, children=s ability to comprehend and evaluate advertising messages has spurred a good deal of debate and research over the past 30 years. One conclusion by researchers is that children in different age groups have different information processing skills. Many categorize children aged 8-12 as "cued processors" - able to retrieve and use information, engaging critical thinking skills, but only when cued. Kids in this age group tend not to think critically and often fail to differentiate between central and peripheral content when learning new information. Our aim is to give them some tools they can use, and some cues on when to use them at a time when many of them are starting to have their own money, make independent purchasing decisions, and exert influence on the family=s buying decisions. The secondary audience for this campaign includes parents and educators, primarily as a mechanism to reinforce the questions and concepts being delivered to the 8-12-year-old target audience. Both parents and teachers can help cue these children to apply critical thinking skills. We are seeking a contractor with experience reaching: 1) Children aged 8-12; 2) Parents and other caregivers; 3) Teachers and other educators Areas of Interest: The FTC seeks a contractor to assist the agency in the design, implementation and marketing of a campaign to promote advertising literacy, including the following: 1) Developing successful interactive, multimedia, web-based methods for communicating with young audiences: The contractor shall work with the FTC to create and implement an interactive website designed to engage youngsters in the target age group. Games and activities should illustrate the core concepts and key questions about understanding advertising. The site also will have sections with resources for parents and teachers to use and download. The construction of the interactive website is expected to occupy much of the first year of the campaign. Subsequently, the contractor will be tasked with developing innovative tools to enhance the agency's ability to effectively and efficiently deliver the campaign message to both primary and secondary target audiences. Products to be created may include print materials, and CDs and DVDs suitable for use in schools and libraries. A) Developing curricula to deliver content to young people: The contractor shall create engaging, creative, and interactive curricula that teach children 8-12 about advertising. B) Developing engaging, inviting and appropriate materials to deliver content to young people: The contractor shall develop engaging, creative, and useful materials to support the campaign messages about recognizing and decoding advertising. These materials might include print, audio, video, and other multimedia materials. C) Success in marketing information to young people: The contractor shall develop and carry out a plan to market the campaign's resources to the target audience (including children aged 8-12, parents, and educators). A challenge of the campaign will be to cut through the clutter that children hear and see in the media everyday, developing messages that resonate with them, and finding ways to deliver the message in ways they will see, use, and learn from it. Using the same channels that advertisers and marketers use to communicate with kids may be more likely to be successful in reaching and resonating with the target audience, so the contractor shall consider those in developing and carrying out a marketing plan. Required Documentation: To be considered for this project, the contractor shall submit 5 copies of the following documentation (Submission documents should use at least 12-point font.): 1) Narrative: A brief description covering the following areas [not to exceed 6 pages]: a) The contractor's approach to developing an interactive website designed to engage the target age group (young people, parents, educators). b) The contractor's approach to creating engaging curricula for students aged 8-12, as well as for developing print and multimedia materials to support the campaign. c) The contractor's approach to developing engaging print and multimedia materials to support the campaign. d) The contractor's approach to marketing the campaign and its resources to the target audience(s). e) The contractor's approach to securing the expertise required to carry out these areas of interest.**NOTE: A very detailed project plan is not required at this point.** 2. Staffing Plan: A detailed staffing plan that includes the contractor's team to be assigned, the specific role each member of the team would serve on this project, and a copy of each person's resume and a summary of other relevant experience. Any sub-contractors to be hired should be identified in the Staffing Plan. 3. Price Estimate: For the purposes of price-comparison, the contractor shall provide an estimate for the four program elements: Developing an interactive website to engage the target audience(s); Creating engaging curricula for students aged 8-12; Creating engaging print and multimedia materials to support the campaign; and Marketing the campaign and its resources to the target audience(s). 4. Project Samples: Provide hard-copy (electronically scanned and included in the email quote submittal) samples of three similar projects (completed or ongoing), in which substantial work was carried out by contractor staff presented in the staffing plan. Samples should include the client organization, a description of the work, major accomplishments or outcomes, approximate dollar value, contract number (if applicable), and point of contact for reference. One of these samples must demonstrate the contractor's ability to develop and implement a campaign targeted to children. Evaluation Criteria: The Government will award a contract on a best-value basis, where narrative, staffing plan, and project samples/past performance are weighted higher than cost. Project Management &amp; Deliverables: The initiatives developed by the contractor must clearly articulate the agreed-upon message to the intended audience(s) in an effective and cost-efficient manner. The information must be accessible, practical, and actionable, and convey contact information for contacting or filing a complaint with the FTC. The contractor will manage the development and implementation of the various projects and is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and quality of all products. During performance of the contract, the contractor will provide pricing estimates based on Work Assignments for specific deliverables. The contractor will itemize the time, cost, and other factors required to complete each work assignment. The FTC's Division of Consumer and Business Education will serve as the agency contact. The FTC might invite up to the top three respondents to give a brief presentation about their capabilities, their proposed plan for developing an interactive website targeting children aged 8-12, their plan to develop curriculum for the target audience, their plan to create print and other supporting materials, and a marketing plan to reach the target audience(s). This presentation will be factored in determining who will be awarded the contract; all contractors should be available to travel to the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, DC during September, 2008. Period of Performance: The Period of Performance for this contract is for a one-year base period with three one-year optional periods.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Compact Manipulator and Cartesian Motion System (Linear Rail) to be used in the Intelligent Systems Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. ***

BACKGROUND
The Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) in the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL) has need for a compact, lightweight manipulator with a high payload and the capability to move through about a 1 cubic meter workspace. The Division also requires a Cartesian motion system (linear rail) that will be used to dynamically position the manipulator. The manipulator and rail must independently and simultaneously control arm and rail dynamic motions. The manipulator must be able to be mounted on the floor and the ceiling and on the linear rail. It must be able to move rapidly and must be able to repeatedly reach a position with 0.1 mm accuracy or better. The robot controller must be able to report accurate position information to an outside computer at a rate of at least 20 Hz. It must be able to interface with other devices using at least the Ethernet protocol and accept input from external sources at a rate of at least 20 Hz. For the measurement project in which these devices will be used, it is necessary to be able to view the end of the robot arm (tool tip) with continuous line-of-sight from a highly accurate laser tracker.

a sole source basis for the Mosaic Photobleaching Accessory for Nikon Ti Total
Internal Reflection Flourescence (TIRF) Microscope System with Photonic
Instruments Inc; 2435 Dean St., Unit A; Saint Charles, Illinois 60175.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The proposed contract action
was publicized in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) and procured
as a Simplified Acquisition purchase as authorized in FAR 13.106-1. The North
American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size
standard is 500 employees.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Laboratory of Cellular
and Molecular Biology (LCMB) investigates normal cellular signal transduction
and aberrations in signaling pathways that are associated with neoplasias in
humans and model systems. The LCMB studies the role of oncogenes, growth
factors immumoreceptors, and downstream effector molecules in neoplastic and
normal cellular activation and proliferation. The goal of these studies is to
decline cellular activation pathways, to identify mechanisms that induce
cancer, and to provide possible diagnostic and preventative measures to utilize
at the clinical level. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Mosaic photobleaching
accessory for the Nikon Ti Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF)
microscope will enable more efficient performance that is dependent on
observation of dynamic microscopic structures in live cells. NCI needs to
analyze the dynamic behavior of intracellular organelles and proteins labeled
with fluorescence probes including genetic tags like the green fluorescent
protein (GFP). To follow particular cohorts of dynamic structures NCI needs to
either photobleach or photoactivate arbitrary areas (any shape) in living cells
while observing them with the Nikon Ti TIRF microscope. For our studies NCI
needs to perform the photobleaching rapidly at any time during an imaging
experiment. Addition of photobleaching capabilities to the system is crucial
for several scientific projects currently under investigation by the group
including following the fate of T cell receptor subunits in T cell- B cell
conjugates, monitoring the movement of vesicles in the social amoeba <em>Dictyostelium discoideum</em>, observing the
biogenisis and stability of adhesive structures as well as photoactivation and
photoconversion of clustered molecules in activated Jurkat T cells.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class="MessageHeaderLabel"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-transform: none;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The photobleaching accessory
we acquire must be compatible with the Nikon Ti microscope that we are
purchasing for TIRF imaging. Because the photobleaching unit much be
coordinated with the TIRF imaging system and must be controlled with the Nikon
software that operates the instrument, only a photobleaching accessory from
Photonic Instruments, which can be controlled by the Nikon Elements software,
can be used.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no other known

            WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 16 August 08. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 15 August 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

Further, the system specifications established in the Statement of Work are the minimum required and proposals will be evaluated based on meeting and/or exceeding these minimum requirements. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards under this solicitation to the offeror(s) whose proposal(s) provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>

We need sufficient materials for 60 miles of fence with appropriately spaced gates, posts, etc. conforming to terrain.   

Fence Style:

Standard 4-wire fence construction with metal stays.  Smooth wire will be the bottom wire.  All line wire will be dead ended at gates, corners and line brace posts.  All metal posts will be placed so that the spade is completely below the ground.  If in hard rock, the hole will be drilled to allow the steel post to be placed into the ground.  

Braces: Braces will be constructed every  mile at each gate and at each change in the fence alignment (corner) according to Forest Service standards.  Rock cribs or rock jacks may be substituted for steel braces if appropriate and agreed upon in advance.  Three-five post brace corners and/or diagonal end braces will be installed in all locations where a corner is formed.  Post pipe shall be buried 39 in the ground (except 24 in rock).  Line braces shall be constructed at a minimum distance of  mile, as well as at the crest of hills and the base of all drainages.  In draws where the fence wire has a tendency to pull the steel posts out of the ground, a rock or steel post anchor shall be placed at these points.  

Creek crossings:  at any major creek crossings, a separate fence will be built across each creek crossing to prevent the main fence from being destroyed in the event of high water or flooding.

Gates: all gates encountered along the fence are to be considered part of the fence.  All gates will be 16.5 (rod) wide.  Gates are to be built at a ll previous locations and will be built with 4 strands of barbed wire, two wooden posts and 48 metal stays.  Smooth wire will be used on the gate post except for the mechanical latch.   

Terrain:  the elevation runs from approximately 4000 to 7500.  The terrain rolls with draws, steep hillsides, some rock outcrops, talus slopes, as well as sagebrush, aspen, mahogany and grassland along the unburned portions.  Clearing will be done by the contractor or permittee with hand tools or a chainsaw.  Clearing is only necessary to ensure the fence is straight between braces.

(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received in response to the original synopsis solicitation.  There is no change to the original response due date.<BR><BR>The following questions and answers are provided:<BR><BR>Question 1:  For both the SWIR camera and the MWIR camera there is a specification that states The FPA shall have a resolution of 640 by 512 pixels and the pixel pitch shall not exceed 22 um in either dimension (pixel width or height).  And in a later specification for both cameras there is another request that The camera shall be capable of accepting the standard f/2.3, twist-lock bayonet mount lenses sold by companies such as Optimum Optical and Janos Technology.  Our camera system does work with all Janoss and Optimum Optical Systems lenses but has a 25um pixel pitch.  It is also our understanding that neither of the lens manufacturers have an airy disc that requires exactly a 22um pixel size nor a image plane field of view diagonal that wouldnt allow for a 25um pixel pitch detector with 640x512 pixel array.  My question is can the detector pixel pitch be 25um square in size and still work for this requirement, assuming full compatibility with the Janos and Optimum Optical Lenses?  Answer 1:  Yes, the pixels can be 25 microns square and meet the requirement of compatibility with f/2.3 lenses.<BR> <BR>Question 2:  Question concerns the specification for both cameras that The communication and data transfer links to the camera shall be implemented via the Camera Link interface.  If our camera can provide full digital data through CameraLink Base but communication and control with the camera through USB, Gigabit Ethernet, or RS-232 Serial, would that be acceptable?  Answer 2:   No, both the communication link and the data link need to be implemented through the Camera Link interface. The data acquisition system (DAS) for use with these cameras was procured recently and the DAS will be setup for the communication link and the data link to be implemented via Camera Link. So the IR cameras need to have both links implemented through Camera Link to be compatible with the DAS.  Point of contact is Martha Robles, 575-678-4963 or via email at martha.robles@arl.army.mil

 HSAR 3052.20970  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

It is estimated that 192 battery strings will be replaced per year.
It is the FAA's intent to award two contracts to meet this requirement.  It is anticipated that Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contracts will be written to fulfill this requirement.
The results of the market survey will assist the FAA to determine the extent of contracts that may be set-aside for small businesses, Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Small Businesses [8(a)] and Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses.  
The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 335911-Storage Battery Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 500 employees.
Firms submitting a response are requested to provide the following information:  (1) Name and address of company; (2) Point of contact (name, position within the company, and telephone number); and (3) Completed Business Declaration Form, attached.  
Responses to this market survey should be via e:mail to the Contracting Officer using the following e:mail address:  connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.  Responses must be received no later than close of business, August 15, 2008.   
This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the FAA will arise as a result of submission of responses to this market survey and the FAA's use of such information.  
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.

Amendment 0001:  The second bulletted item in the paragraph that begins with"These reseach activities require:" is replaced in its entirety by the following:
  Events data on a broad range of airplane types, such as transport airplanes, regional and business jets, propeller airplanes, turbo-props, etc., operated in both domestic and foreign/international airspace by, at a minimum, sixty (60) air carriers worldwide; 
End of amendment 0001

Description of Requirement:  The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Air Traffic Organization Operations Planning (ATO-P), Research and Technology Development Office, Airport and Aircraft Safety Group is  responsible for conducting research in support of the development of regulations, safety polities and guidance materials to continue enhancement of aviation safety.  The FAA SMS Doctrine, Order VS 8000.1, describes the FAA data-driven approach to provide effective safety oversight.  The FAA has taken major steps to implement the SMS Doctrine to aviation safety, air traffic management (ATM), airport safety, and international aviation.  As part of the FAA SMS approach to manage increased safety, the FAA has taken initiatives to "promote and expand safety information sharing efforts, including FAA-industry partnerships and data-driven safety programs that identify, prioritize, and address risks before they lead to accidents. "  Safety Management System (SMS) is being adopted worldwide as the primary means of promoting aviation safety and accident prevention initiatives.  
The Flight Safety Team (AJP6350) has been conducting specific studies of events that might have safety implications by analyzing available data systems in support of the FAA safety objectives.  AJP6350 supports the FAA's safety goals by taking responsibility for developing, managing and conducting research activities that bolster FAA aviation safety, particularly the achievement of the FAA Goal of Increased Safety as outlined in the FAA Flight Plan 2008-2012.  
Typical examples of research projects currently supported by AJP6350 are:
Aviation risk analysisAviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS)Terminal Area SafetyAircraft icing researchSoftware and digital system safetyUnmanned aircraft system researchAdvanced aircraft systemsNextGen safety initiatives
These research activities require:
  Analysis of a broad range of safety data collected from actual operations around the world to identify technical areas of potential safety issues, to conduct safety risk analysis and to verify and validate outputs generated from safety research initiatives.    Accident data on a broad range of airplane types, such as regional jets, propeller airplanes, turbo-props, etc., that operate in both domestic and foreign airspace;  Access to a broad range of aviation safety data systems such as Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) data for incidents reports, Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) by multiple airlines internationally and other international aviation data systems;  The Contractor must own, operate and manage these data sharing systems, which contain data submitted from member airlines operating around the globe, in a manner that protects the airlines proprietary information but is still available for direct and easy extraction of information relevant to specific aviation events, identify potential risks and safety trends.  The contractor must have personnel who have extensive experience and knowledge in the following subjectsall with an emphasis on international aviation:  safety, flight operations, fleet management, certification and airworthiness issues, maintenance and inspection requirements, airspace and air traffic management, air navigation and communications
At this time, the International Air Transportation Association (IATA), located in Montreal, Canada, is the only organization known to possess these capabilities.  IATA owns global aviation databases and employs a complementary staff of aviation accident experts who have a depth of experience with records and coverage of aviation accidents worldwide.  IATA maintains two data systems that are critical to the success of the research contemplated by the FAA.  Their Safety Trend Evaluation, Analysis & Data Exchange System (STEADES systems contain, respectively, information needed to reduce accidents through identification of safety trends that will be used to make risk management decisions to improve safer flights in the future.  Flight Data Analysis (FDA) is a database that contains uploads of member airlines' flight recorders, vital information necessary for analysis safety trends and making accident-avoidance decisions.
IATA is considered to be the only source with the requisite data and technical experts capable of successfully responding to the FAA's requirement.  Therefore, the FAA intends to enter into a single source, five-year contract with IATA.  
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If you do not agree with this single source determination, you must provide evidence of your ability to meet all of the requirements listed above for the FAA to evaluate.  All responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than close of business Tuesday, August 8, 2008.  Responses may be sent to the attention of Ms. Schlegel by fax at 609.485-4088 or by e-mail at: phyliss.schlegel@faa.gov.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) Program consists of a number of separate procurements for contractor support services. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) continues to refine the acquisition strategy for the MiDAESS effort and finalize the specific details of the solicitations for each functional area.  As noted in the Executive Summary to the January 2008 Draft RFP, the MDA was aware of inconsistencies in the acquisition strategy as many of the industry questions submitted following release confirmed. The MDA intends to release another Draft RFP in the fall of this year that will provide the final MiDAESS acquisition strategy and additional details on the specific functional efforts.  In addition, another industry day or other similar forum is projected after release of the Draft RFP.  More details will be provided later on this topic through the FedBizOpps website.  The information received to date from industry has been of great value to the Agency in improving the overall strategy and achieving program success.  The Agency also appreciates the continued interest in and support of this important initiative.

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole/single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   FAR Part 6  Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.      

This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular   FAC 05-26 (as of June 12, 2008). 

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 541611, with size standard of $6.5.

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that only Ms. Jane E. Hymiller can perform the requisite services specified herein.

 THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Institute of Arthritis intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Ms. Jane E. Hymiller, 6934 Eylers Valley Flint Road, Sabillasville, MD, 21780-8900 to complete ongoing Budgetary Support Services.

 Background:

This is the last phase of the Financial Budgetary Support Services agreement.

Ms. Hymiller's knowledge of NIAMS and its NIH,  financing and grants award processes, the database systems, the relationships with Congress and constituency groups, as well as her familiarity with NIAMS and NIH senior management make her distinctively knowledgeable to carry out these  final tasks.  Because of the impracticality of finding competitors other than Ms. Hymiller who possess the necessary skills and knowledge, the NIAMS proposes to award this purchase order on a noncompetitive basis.  Ms. Hymiller brings with her more than twenty-seven years of Financial Budgetary experience.

She consults with the Scientific Information Technology Branch (SITB), the Grants Management Branch (GMB) and the QVR Development team to develop, customize and improve reports that combine data from Institute and NIH Information Systems to enhance the Institutes financial management capabilities and facilitate analyses of extramural programs, particularly with regard to grants fiscal control. 

Task Performed during from Phase I, Phase II and the final Phase are as follows: 

1.Develop automated methodologies and/ or systems to allow NIAMS to track the budget status of extramural funds by project and produce reports on a regular basis.

 
2.Develop and maintained electronic briefing books for the Directors use at Congressional       hearings and for reference by NIAMS staff.
3.Developed electronic file system for storing current and historical budget data.
	
4.Conduct special analyses in response to ad hoc request from NIAMS staff, central NIH, Administration, Congress, and the public.
	
5.Develop effective electronic tracking system for taps and assessments.
	
6.Develop budget models for projecting various outcomes based on input of different budget   scenarios.
 
7.Develop slides for budget presentations to Advisory Council members and other groups   as needed.
	
8. Develop and set up electronic formats for NIAMS to prepare various budget formation tables and exhibits. (examples include: calculation of intramural and RMS mandatory tables, Basic/Applied Research, Object Class worksheet, commitment base calculation, summary of changes, mechanism tables, etc.
	
9.Develop best practices instructions and procedures for use by new and junior staff.
	
The final phase of this budgetary service level of effort is not to exceed 950 hours. The period of performance is from date of award to December 30, 2008.
	
Through competitive procedures Ms. Jane E. Hymiller was awarded a purchase order to conduct Phase I and Phase II of this budgetary project
	
 The Government anticipates that there will be one performance based service contract awarded for this requirement. 
	
 Deliverables:	 
The contractor will provide expert recommendations to the Chief, Financial Management Branch, NIAMS and the Institute's Grants Financial Data Analyst on matters regarding funds control for extramurally supported NIAMS projects and on financial analyses utilizing data such as research applications, grants, training, and fellowship data files in a written report. 
	
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
	
 The sole source determination is based upon Ms. Hymillers in-depth experience, knowledge skills and experience gained during the process of working NIH budgetary systems.   Ms.Hymiller is uniquely familiar with NIH and NIAMS Budgetary service is best needed to conduct this highly delicate transfer.  Therefore,  an award to any other source is not feasible nor practical. 
	
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  
	
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
	
Inquires to this notice,  referencing number NHLBI-PB-(AR)2008-207-RCO may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6128, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rosie C. Owens, Contract Specialist.

 7) Prepare and submit the annual ethics training reports.  Provide, as requested, an ethic orientation to new Advisory Council Members.
8) Identify specific ethics problem(s) to be addressed by obtaining information and input from the Office of the Director, NIAMS. 
 9) Review in concert with NHLBI Committee Management Service Center, financial disclosure forms for each Advisory Council member, before each Council meeting. 
10) Prepare a poster on conflict of interest ethics, if required, at the annual Intramural Ethics retreat.
11) Coordinate and review other ethic activities as needed, including official duty activities, outside activities, honorary degrees, awards, widely attended gatherings, CRADAs, clinical protocols, Materials Transfer Agreements, waivers and authorizations, HHS-716 review, and the like, so that they can be signed by the DEC.
12)  Review travel documentation for ethics purposes. Serve as the Liaison with the NIH Ethics Office.

14) Attend meetings of the DECs and Ethics Coordinators. 
15) Respond to ad hoc ethics inquiries from institute staff.
16) Maintain ethics files.
17) Transfer ethics records to other Institutes and Centers as appropriate
18) Prepare other reports as requested by the NIH Ethics Office during the course of the project period. 

The service level of effort is not to exceed 1000 hours. 
	
The period of performance is from date of award to April 30, 2009.
	
Through competitive procedures Hausmantech was awarded a purchase order to conduct Phase I and Phase II of Ethic Support Services.

<DESC>To: All Recipients of the prospectus: CC-DRTO001-08- A Concession Business Opportunity for round trip passenger ferry service between Key West, FL and Dry Tortugas National Park and other specified services
NPS RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY JEWELS 
QUESTION 1
What range of alcoholic beverages is expected to be available?  Are mixed cocktails expected to be served?
NPS RESPONSE:The sale of alcoholic beverages is an authorized visitor service addressed in Section 3(a)(2) of the Draft Contract on page 4, and in the Draft Operating Plan, subsection 4D)(2) on page A-19.  Other than these provisions, the Prospectus does not address NPS expectations about this service because it is not a required service.  Alcoholic beverage sales theoretically could include beer, wine and mixed cocktails.  However, specific details regarding this or any of the authorized services the successful Offeror proposes to provide will be addressed accordingly in the Operating Plan when the new contract is awarded.
QUESTION 2
Is there a full range kitchen on board the ferry or at dock?
NPS RESPONSE:	A concessioner's vessel may have a full range kitchen although it is not included in the Vessel Requirements listed in Section 3) C) of Contract Exhibit A: Draft Operating Plan.  Except for the contract requirements expressly stated in the Prospectus documents, the concessioner is otherwise responsible for determining what equipment and arrangements will be necessary to meet the Food and Beverage Service requirements of the Draft Contract.   NPS does not provide a full range kitchen on the dock. 
QUESTION 3
What are the days and hours of operation of the ferry?
NPS RESPONSE:		Information about operating schedules and requirements under the Draft Contract is in Sections 3) D) (1) and 4) A) of Contract Exhibit A: Draft Operating Plan.  Information regarding operating schedules of the current operators is not addressed in the Prospectus.  However, this is public information tour operators would routinely make available to customers and potential customers upon request.  These schedules are subject to change and would only be illustrative of what has been proposed and approved in the past.  

QUESTION 4
How many trips per day?
NPS RESPONSE:	The current limitation of one trip per day for each vessel used in the operations also applies under the Draft Contract.  Please refer to Section 3) (a) (1) of the Draft Contract and Section 4) A) of Contract Exhibit A: Draft Operating Plan for specific information about operating schedules and requirements under the Draft Contract.     
QUESTION 5
Can a menu of what is presently offered be available for review?
NPS RESPONSE:	Information about food product offerings required under the Draft Contract is shown in Section 4) D) of Contract Exhibit A: Draft Operating Plan.  Information regarding menus of the current operators is not addressed in the Prospectus.  However, this is public information tour operators would routinely make available to customers and potential customers upon request.  These menus are subject to change and would only be illustrative of what has been proposed and approved in the past.  
QUESTION 6
Is any money awarded by the government of this solicitation or is it the sales of the vendor from ferry patrons that is the sole financial benefit?
NPS RESPONSE:   The National Park Service does not award money under its concessions contracts.  Information about the potential financial benefits that may result from successful operations under the Draft Contract is contained in the Business Opportunity section of the Prospectus. 
To: All Recipients of the prospectus: CC-DRTO001-08- A Concession Business Opportunity for round trip passenger ferry service between Key West, FL and Dry Tortugas National Park and other specified services
NPS RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SUNNY DAYS CATAMARANS
QUESTION 1
If a respondent proposed that the current situation, which has provided service  to the park for 12 years, be left in place for a year allowing time to build a final vessel(s), will the respondent be considered non-responsive?
NPS RESPONSE:	  Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.  
QUESTION 2
The solution that we would propose would use the same construction technology            as the Boeing 787 (carbon composite).  It would only burn 99,000 gallons per year with 330 operating days. Due to the boat building capabilities of Sunny Days Catamarans and our partnership with Gold Coast Yachts, we are uniquely situated to provide two vessels that meet the passenger requirements to insure uninterrupted service to the park. With this in mind, once again, will I be considered non-responsive if I propose another solution to meet your passenger requirements? 
NPS RESPONSE:All offerors must agree to provide a single primary vessel "within 24 months of the execution of the Contract" as specified in the Business Opportunity, Primary Vessel, page 20 and Contract Exhibit A: Draft Operating Plan, Primary Vessel Requirements, page A-5.  Decisions concerning vessel requirements were made during the prospectus development process. Considerations included, without limitation, financial, operational, and visitor comfort concerns.  Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.  
                               QUESTION 3
This brings us to my concern for the environmental issue of burning large quantities of fuel. Any vessel currently in existence that can meet all the requirements in your prospectus would be unable to provide a relatively low environmental impact. Will I be considered non-responsive if I propose a different means, one that is much more environmentally friendly, to the same end? 
NPS RESPONSE:Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.  	 QUESTION 4
Also of concern is the prospectus specifying a USCG certification for 200 passengers.  If the vessel is certified to carry 151 passengers or more it is required to comply with the Maritime Transportation Security Act.  In Key West, because of the city's interpretation of the act, this is a considerable unrecognized expense in the prospectus that can be circumvented by having two vessels with a maximum passenger capacity of 150 each. On the extremely rare days when running entirely full and having large numbers of park employees, both vessels could be operated. If I propose this, will I be considered non-responsive?
NPS RESPONSE:As shown on the enclosed Errata No. 1 for DRTO001-08, the NPS has revised the requirement for a Certificate of Inspection (COI) for a minimum 200 passengers.  The capacity requirements are specified in the Business Opportunity, Exhibit 18, page 20 and Contract Exhibit A: Draft Operating Plan, Primary Vessel Requirements, Section 3 C (2), page A-5.  The revised capacity requirement in these sections specifies a minimum of 150 passengers.

QUESTION 5
There are several other concerns, relatively minor, but if I address them in the proposal and offer a different solution, will I be considered non-responsive?
NPS RESPONSE: 	Without knowing what the questioner's concerns are specifically, NPS is unable to provide a meaningful response to this question.  However, as noted in the NPS responses to questions 11 through 13, "offerors should respond to the questions in the Proposal Package Prospectus as written."  

QUESTION 6
[Ref.: Draft Contract Exhibit A Draft Operating Plan 3C 'Vessel Requirements' pp. A-4 to A-6] The Park's General Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement found no technical or environmental reason to mandate one vessel over two vessels for the ferry run. (Decision p. 30 stated: "The number of vessels used in the operation, and arrival and departure patterns at Fort Jefferson, will be determined in the concession contracting process.") Since the choice of a single primary vessel isn't mandated by either technical or environmental factors, would NPS consider eliminating the prospectus requirement to perform with a single vessel during the contract's permanent phase, and amending the solicitation to permit more flexible proposals that demonstrate the ability to transport the requisite number of passengers on the basis of each offeror's relative ability to do so in an environmentally friendly, fuel efficient, and cost-effective manner?
NPS RESPONSE:The NPS has considered the request to eliminate the single-Primary Vessel requirement and is not revising the Prospectus to accommodate the request.  Decisions concerning vessel requirements were made during the prospectus development process. Considerations included, without limitation, financial, operational, and visitor comfort concerns.  Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.

**** CONTRACT INFORMATION: This announcement is 100% set-aside for 8(a) eligible firms in Region IV, including GA, AL, FL, MS, NC, SC, KY and TN ONLY.  The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of two Multidiscipline Indefinite Delivery Contracts. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by Savannah District for use on federal projects under its jurisdiction and, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers Districts. Contract limits and contract size will be determined at the time of selection. Typically, each contract will consist of a base ordering period and four option periods, each period not to exceed one year, for a total of five years maximum. An option may be exercised before the expiration of the base contract period (or option period) if the contract amount has been exhausted or nearly exhausted. The total amount of each contract over the five-year ordering period may not exceed $5,000,000. Task Orders to be executed under this contract will be primarily for projects with a value no greater than $5 million. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below. Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory based on the performance risk to the government that the offeror will successfully perform the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval. Award will be made to the firm(s) determined to be most highly qualified. The number of contracts that will be issued will be dependent on the amount of work that will be required. Projects to be designed are not yet determined and funds are not presently available. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based upon the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC contracts, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, (3) Proximity of the firm to the project site and familiarity with design criteria/codes and construction methods used at the locality (4) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The NAICS is 541330; size standard $4.5 million. Work will predominately consist of providing value engineering services by following the Value Engineering methodology expressed by the Society American Value Engineers using simple Value Engineering Study Reports.  This primarily consists of utilizing the five-step value engineering job plan consisting of the Information Phase, the Speculative Phase, the Analysis Phase, the Development Phase and the Presentation Phase. These concepts will be applied to facilities in any phase of the design process.   Other work may include preparation of reports, studies, project planning, design criteria, preparation of drawings and specifications, cost estimates, and other general A-E services for multi-disciplined new construction and renovation projects for military and other government agencies. This work can consists of the design of new vertical construction on facilities commonly found at military installations (barracks, dining facilities, offices, training facilities, equipment maintenance facilities, labs, etc.) as well as some smaller horizontal construction projects (airfields, roads, ranges, etc.). The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services that may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, shop drawing review, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. All design CADD files must be delivered in the (*dgn) format. All design must comply with the Savannah District Design Manual and individual Installation Design Guide. 
****SELECTION CRITERIA: Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: *Significantly More Important* means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor. *More Important* means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater. *Equal* means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. For this solicitation, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence and Past Performance are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Key Personnel, Work Management and Volume of DoD Contract Awards. Key Personnel, Work Management and Volume of DoD Contract Awards are weighted equally. Each criterion should be submitted FOR THE OFFICE AND/OR EMPLOYEE PERFORMING THE WORK in lieu of other offices/employees for firms in multiple locations. For firms that have offices in multiple locations, evidence of meeting the criteria should be presented for the office and/or employee that would actually be performing the work in response to this announcement. It is recognized that for firms with multiple locations, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. If more than one office is represented, the Selection Board will consider under the Work Management Plan the performance risk associated with that team not being co-located and the geographical proximity to the supported projects.
