<DESC>NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (NASA/AFRC) intends to solicit and award a sole source Purchase Order under the authority FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) "Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available" for the following programs SOFIA, DC-8 and C-20 who are needing a 1 year subscription service which shall include: real-time medical consultation capability to determine how best to manage an individual who might be having medical symptoms. This might include first-aid treatment on-board the aircraft, medical diversion if feasible, or a continuation of the flight until landing. Vendor must have a 24/7 response capability in which one of their physicians can be hooked up by phone patch via radio to the aircrafts pilot, to discuss the problem real-time, solicit feedback, and advise accordingly. Service provider would be an appropriate risk migrator; to MedAire, Inc., 1250 W Washington St. Ste. 442, Tempe, AZ, 85281-1796.<br /><br />Justification is based upon the following facts: 1. MedAire, Inc. developed and owns the exclusive proprietary hardware and software for this product and is the only vendor qualified to provide the software and technical support with 24/7 response capability in which one of their physicians can be contacted by the onboard Iridium phone to discuss the issue in real-time. 2. There are no other products available that perform the same function as the MedLink, MedAire Inc. In addition, time constraints and extensive costs for getting another company certified with the equivalent capabilities would jeopardize mission schedules. These reasons justify procuring the required services exclusively from MedAire, Inc. <br /><br />The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.<br />&nbsp;<br />Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. PT on July 5, 2016. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency. Submittals should be made in writing to NASA - AFRC, P.O. Box 273, Mailstop 4811/140, Edwards, CA 93523 or via email to tiffany.n.goodwin@nasa.gov.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html.<br /><br />The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 621493 and $15.0M respectively.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services (CSELS) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order to Altmetric LLP, Brunel Road Houndsmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 6XS, United Kingdom. The purpose of the acquisition is to purchase the Explorer for Institutions software.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) (1) -Exclusive licensing agreements/Proprietary data.</p>
<p>CDC believes that Altmetric LLP is the only source available with the product that provides the requisite information to CDC scientists and leadership about the social media impact of scientific publications authored by CDC users of Altmetric Explorer as well being able to follow the social media activity for any article that is being tracked by the Altmetric product, whether or not it has a CDC author.</p>
<p>CDC believes that Altmetrics LLP is the only source with the following required functionality:<br />&bull; The product does not require individuals to update a profile or provide regular updates about their research outputs.<br />&bull; The product comprehensively tracks news sources and policy documents across multiple languages using sophisticated text mining techniques.<br />&bull; The product provides fully auditable and transparent data at the output level, allowing researchers to determine not only the source of the attention (both author and outlet) but the content of the attention.<br />&bull; The product facilitates benchmarking against all trackable Altmetric content - not just the content from the purchasing institutions.<br /><br />No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Altmetrics, LLP. Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Ms. Alma C. Barber via email to vel3@cdc.gov using solicitation number 2016-Q-65368 in the subject line, no later than 2:00pm Eastern Time, July 10, 2016.</p>

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 334519 with the related size standard of 500 employees (or dollars). The Offeror shall be actively registered with that NAICS or a similar NAICS with the appropriate size standard prior to Award to be considered for any resulting contract. Failure to be properly registered under the appropriate size standard during evaluation and/or at the time of award deems the offer ineligible for award. A similar NAICS Code with the appropriate size standard other than the NAICS Code identified in this buy term may be used as a factor to determine technical capability. (Size standards do not apply to unrestricted set-aside solicitation/RFQ). <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: David W. Reynolds Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 240-3198 Email: david.w.reynolds.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR) was established to serve as a hub where development of technology for gene therapy will be carried out.</p>
<p>The Organic Acid Research Section of MGMGB, NHGRI, NIH studies a group of inherited metabolic disorders that cause increased methylmalonic acid and homocysteine to accumulate in body fluids. The conditions are generally caused by impaired intracellular metabolism of vitamin B12 or by defects in two enzymes - methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) and methionine synthase - that require the vitamin to function. Isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is one of the most common inborn errors of organic acid metabolism. The lab uses model organisms to study MMA pathophysiology and has created a number of mouse models to study the disorder. Gene therapy using adeno-associated viral vectors to deliver the MUT gene to mice is a critical mission of the Section. The testing of the effects of gene therapy vectors in mice needed in this procurement  relates to both AAV and the main disorder under study, methylmalonic acidemia.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Dectris Ltd., Neuenhoferstrasse 107, Baden, AG, 5400, Switzerland, to provide an x-ray photon counting detector camera that is required by the Imaging Physics Laboratory within NHLBI's Department of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Imaging Physics Laboratory has been conducting research in phase-contrast and high resolution x-ray imaging for a number of years now. This work will potentially reduce the radiation dose to patients and obtain sharper and better quality images of the body. A key element in reducing radiation dose is to reduce the noise of the x-ray camera. A photon counting detector has essentially no instrumental noise and is superior to conventional detectors. Integrating a photon counting detector into our development helps reduce the radiation dose on patients and improve imaging speed.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a PILATUS3 X 100K-A x-ray photon counting detector camera that is required by the lab to enhance the image quality and reduce the radiation dose in phase-contrast and high-resolution x-ray imaging devices that are being developed for clinical applications.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The PILATUS3 X 100K-A is the only photon counting detector that meets the needs of the Imaging Physics Laboratory. Based on our market research we have determined that Dectris Ltd is the sole manufacturer of the PILATUS3 X 100K-A equipment, and is therefore the only supplier that can fulfill the laboratory's specific requirement.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339112, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-88 (June 15th, 2016).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Gatan Inc., 5794 W Las Positas Blvd, Pleasanton, CA, 94588-4083, to provide maintenance services on the Gatan Inc. 3View system located in the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering's (NIBIB) Laboratory of Cellular Imaging and Macromolecular Biophysics (LCIMB).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) aims to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies. NIBIB supports research and development of new biomedical imaging and bioengineering techniques and devices to fundamentally improve the detection, treatment, and prevention of disease; enhancing existing imaging and bioengineering modalities; supporting related research in the physical and mathematical sciences; encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas; supporting studies to assess the effectiveness and outcomes of new biologics, materials, processes, devices, and procedures; developing technologies for early disease detection and assessment of health status; and developing advanced imaging and engineering techniques for conducting biomedical research at multiple scales.</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Cellular Imaging and Macromolecular Biophysics develops novel technologies for studying biological processes at unprecedented speed and resolution. Research includes improving the performance of 3D optical imaging microscopes, particularly with respect to resolution and depth (e.g. multifocal structured illumination microscopy, MSIM) and speed and phototoxicity (e.g. inverted selective plane illumination microscopy, iSPIM). The lab collaborates closely with intramural and extramural researchers (both academic and commercial) to ensure that our microscopes are both easily and widely used.<br /> <br />Researchers across the NIH are using the Gatan 3View serial block face (SBF) imaging system in NIBIB's Laboratory of Cellular Imaging and Macromolecular Biophysics to study the three-dimensional structure of cells and tissues. The (SBF) imaging system includes an ultramicrotome built into the specimen chamber of a scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a maintenance agreement for the Gatan Inc. 3View System located in the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering's Laboratory of Cellular Imaging and Macromolecular Biophysics.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide maintenance services including parts, labor, and consumables on the following equipment:</p>
<p>&bull;	Gatan Inc. 3View system</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Gatan Inc. is the manufacturer of this equipment and only the manufacturer is authorized to perform maintenance services or repair. No third parties have been authorized by Gatan Inc. to provide maintenance services on the equipment, and replacement parts are only available through the manufacturer.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, and the Small Business Size Standard is $20.5M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-88 (June 15th, 2016).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B.

<p>This notice is provided pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR part 6.302-1: the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A competitive procurement conducted in 2013 resulted in The Boeing Company being selected as the HAAWC ALA kit and related equipment developer and original equipment manufacturer. The U.S. Government does not have the technical data package and therefore, cannot pursue a full and open competitive contract for the engineering services required to complete HAAWC ALA, FTS, and datalink development.</p>
<p>The intent of this notice is not to solicit competitive offers. The proposed contract action is a modification to an existing contract for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested offerors may submit their capabilities or responses before the closing date and time of this notice to the Government for consideration. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be received by 12:00 EST on 11 July 2016. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Peter Agyei-Sarpong at peter.agyei-sarpong@navy.mil or Megan Einhart at megan.einhart@navy.mil and reference solicitation number N00024-16-R-6419.</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (NFLC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to procure professional development training on a Firm Fixed Price basis for one of its security cooperation employees via the Global Masters Art Program offered by the Fletcher School at Tufts University.  The GMAP has been identified as the most appropriate institution of professional development under the guidance outlined in Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Directive 5012 which established the professional certification program for security coop0eration enterprise employees.  The Fletcher Schools GMAP is a 33-week combined residency and internet-mediated degree program for professionals working in internal affairs.
 The required GMAP curriculum services commence 11 July 2016 and run through 33 weeks thereafter. The GMAP is the sole program which can provide both the requisite professional development academics as required by DSC Directive 5012 and DoD Directive 5105.65 while ensuring the student remains available for full time work, thus restricting this procurement solely to Tufts University.    The proposed contract action is for services which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, that being Tufts University. Not only does the GMAP allow students to remain in their current position full-time while still working towards an academic degree, the GMAP Admissions Committee decision to admit the NDU student was based solely on the students previous academic achievement, international experience and language skills, independent of the International Student Management Office at NDU.
   This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals, but rather a sole source procurement with Tufts University.   The applicable NAICS code and corresponding size standard are 611430 and $11M, respectively.

<DESC><br /><br /><br /><br />Synopsis: <br />Note: This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (4) International Agreement, to Danish and Greenlandic firms ONLY. <br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a Two Phase (Two Steps) Design-Build Request For Proposal (RFP), design-build solicitation package seeking to award a low-price, technically-acceptable, firm-fixed price contract, for the design and construction of the renovations to a three story dormitory at Thule Air Base. The scope includes repair to the existing roof, exterior walls and the complete renovation of the interior finishes and fixtures, to exclude replacing interior walls. Interior renovation includes the minor remodel of the first floor into individual modules consisting of a living room, bedroom and bathroom. The second and third floor configuration to remain as is; a single room with a partially shared bathroom between two bedrooms. Each floor will have renovated common and laundry areas. The construction season is short at Thule Air Base. General Conditions at Thule Air Base are as follows: the location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule's location demands that all supplies &amp; personnel must be shipped and/or transported, in or out, via air and/or sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The region is glaciated and the existing soil is generally permafrost, which exists from 1 to 6 feet below the surface and to a measured depth of 1,600 feet. Average winter temperature is 20 -30 degrees F below zero while average summer temperature is 40-50 degrees F above zero. One annual military cargo sealift departs from Norfolk, Virginia to Thule AB, approximately 1 July. There are two sealifts that go from Copenhagen, Denmark to Thule AB, one in July &amp; one in August. Airlifting any materials or equipment via military aircraft is very expensive and only on an emergency-need basis. It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about 08 July 2016 and the proposals for Phase One will be due on or about 30 days later. The evaluation criteria will be as follows: Factor 1- Specialized Past Experience of the Offeror's Design-Build Team (this includes both the Contractor's and his Design's Team experience); Factor 2 - Past Performance of Offeror' Team. The Phase One (Step One) offers will be evaluated independently against the RFP criteria and the proposal will be rated as outlined in the RFP package. The Government will determine the (up to) top five best qualified firms and ask them to participate in the Phase Two. The top 5 Offerors from Phase One (Step One) will then submit their Phase Two (Step 2). The Proposal will consist to responding to the RFP criteria for Factor 3 - Qualifications of the Offeror's Team and the Price Proposal. The evaluation criteria details will be further discussed in the RFP solicitation. The Government will award a firm-fixed-price contract to the responsible Offeror whose Phase One (Step One) and Phase Two (Step Two) proposals are technically acceptable and whose offer is the lowest price. The period of performance for this project is 600 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed date. The specifications will be posted electronically via the Federal Business Opportunity website at www.fbo.gov. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 for Commercial &amp; Institutional Building Construction. The magnitude of this construction is between $10,000,000.00 and $15,000,000.00. The size standard is $36,500,000.00.<br />Proposals will be submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, Room 1843, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278, U.S.A.

<DESC><br />A. Introduction
<p>In preparation for milCloud 2 Phase 1, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is investigating the use of commercial capabilities to host unclassified geospatial data and provide related cloud services. The objective of this RFI is to investigate whether commercial capability exists that can host SOF-specific geospatial data and applications for FY17 pilot projects.</p>
<p>Based on the responses and feedback received from this RFI, program representatives may choose to meet with potential offerors and hold one-on-one discussions. Such discussions would only be intended to obtain further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, including any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to the RFI. No determination as to the viability of this requirement has been made at this point and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this RFI will be announced separately.</p>
<p>B. Background</p>
<p>Special Operations Forces (SOF) require access to SOF-specific detailed tactical planning data to support military operations. To meet this requirement, highly accurate 3D BIM, CAD, and GIS data is generated through garrison production as well as mobile collection in preparation for or during ongoing crises and contingency operations.</p>
<p>Dissemination of geospatial data is transitioning from local storage to thin-client based web services. In this model, USSOCOM uses open standards to share highly structured 3D geospatial data via web or cloud services. Using the internet as a transport mechanism means that client-server computing can be used in more situations, and more robustly, to provision SOF warfighters than has previously been possible. Emerging geospatial standards, data compression technologies, and transport also open up the possibility of updating data with expeditionary, field-collected survey information and tactical sensor data including geotagged photos.</p>
<p>USSOCOM currently maintains high performance computing hardware, end-to-end geospatial information systems, and structured geospatial data repositories needed to support web services on classified networks. The program office is investigating the feasibility of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) cloud solution to host unclassified data, services and applications. The objective of the FY17 pilots is to investigate the benefits and issues of deploying unclassified cloud solutions on commercial and / or government networks. Information collected under this RFI will inform a business case analysis and decision on whether the pilot projects could be extended and operationalized in FY18 and FY19.</p>
<p>Two primary concepts of operations below are of immediate interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Crowd Sourced Tactical Planning Data. Expeditionary collection of non-classified survey data to integrate with existing data products through an enterprise service-oriented architecture. In this CONOPS, the cloud service provider would host a government provided prototype web application, non-classified data, and services for disconnected mobile devices using Android and Windows operating systems. The mobile application enables SOF users to visualize and to upload user-generated geospatial content optimized for mobile (GPKG) including photos, voice, and video recordings. Data managers in garrison transfer field collected data to government networks and integrate it seamlessly into the gold dataset. Objective is to make more real-time survey information available to the SOF community.</p>
<p>Clip and Chip. Provisioning up to 300TB of unclassified SOF-specific data for access by tactical mobile users. In this CONOPS, the cloud service provider would push very high fidelity SOF-specific terrain and 3D geospatial data via services optimized for mobile or enable download to portable storage devices (SD card, thumb drive, external hard drive, or micro cloud server) that function on a tactical mesh network. Service would allow pre-loaded mission-specific data to be available during disconnected, intermittent, and latent communication operations. One objective is to demonstrate interoperability of data, services, and interfaces. A second objective is to investigate performance at the tactical edge, operating in disadvantaged and limited bandwidth environments. Government will provide an application that allows users to draw a bounding box within a web browser and download or stream open industry standard SOF-specific geospatial datasets optimized for mobile (GPKG and OGC services).</p>
<p>C. Request for Information</p>
<p>For purposes of this RFI, USSOCOM would like a COTS cloud solution that can deliver capabilities to authorized users in disconnected and tactical environments. Geospatial data is already critical for combat operations, but delivering SOF-specific data via the cloud is new for programs considering FY17 pilot projects. There is no incumbent.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>&bull; The program office is seeking information for leap-ahead capabilities based on open standards and modular open systems that are deployable in a cloud environment. The goal is to field unique open source technologies that provide new capabilities to enhance SOF warfighter information dominance across networks, particularly highly distributed global networks.<br />&bull; Design approach for the efficient and secure integration and operations on multiple networks. Cross domain solutions are desired. Phased deployment:<br />- Commercial pilots in phase one;<br />- DoD NIPR network in phase two; and<br />- DoD SIPR network in phase three.<br />&bull; While initially focused on the two use cases above, the PMO is interested in the development of enterprise data services for consumption and distribution of SOF-specific 3D BIM, CAD and geospatial data across the SOF Information Environment. These cloud services would operate on both classified and unclassified networks, and should address cross-domain and secure mobile use cases.<br />&bull; Considerations that would contribute to lower costs of development, deployment, and operations.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand global network access to USSOCOM-provided geospatial data and applications.<br />&bull; Ability to leverage open source, COTS and GOTS data management servers in order to connect SOF community of interest content and advance interoperability.<br />&bull; Highly scalable with easy synchronization of new data.<br />&bull; Role-based system (user, data manager, etc.).<br />&bull; Multiple methods for identity and access management. Users require public access, LIMDIS user and password, and CAC authentication.<br />&bull; Secure and compliant options for hosting and maintaining physical server based systems at the Contractor facility.<br />&bull; Operate in a commercial, DoD, or hybrid cloud based FedRAMP compliant network meeting DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) mandatory requirements.<br />&bull; Up to security information Impact Level 4: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI, FOUO)<br />&bull; Technical support 24/7/365.<br />&bull; Reasonable exit strategy to prevent vendor lock-in. No exit costs.</p>
<p>If your organization has the potential capability and capacity to meet the requirements through milCloud or other approved implementations, please providing the following:</p>
<p>Architecture information<br />1. From a high level, what approach would you take to deliver the services to SOF?<br />2. Summarize the architectural environment of each possible alternative and provide a drawing or system overview.<br />3. Solutions leveraging or extending Service-common and proven Combat Support Agency or research laboratory components are preferred.<br />4. Outline the data and devices currently integrated into your architecture as well as the level of integration.</p>
<p><br />Cloud Services information<br />5. How would you propose delivering such a service?<br />6. Describe the infrastructure and software used to build the service and the timelines required to implement the service.<br />7. What kind of customer support would be provided with this service?<br />8. Describe the Service Level Agreement including reliability and uptime. <br />9. What type of usage monitoring and metrics would be available to the Government?</p>
<p>Access and Security information<br />10. Please describe the security and how you control access to the service.<br />11. What are integration risks? i.e. certification, accreditation, identify management, etc.</p>
<p>Business information<br />12. Identify challenges and risks from an industry perspective that are associated with performing a similar effort with which your company has experience. <br />13. What lessons learned and risk mitigation strategies can you share?<br />14. Discuss use of existing DoD, Service research lab, NGA, Federal, and commercial cloud services versus standing up a SOF geospatial cloud capability.<br />15. Describe corporate experience with delivering specialized geospatial cloud services on past or present contracts. Please cite any existing contracts where your technical solution or service is currently being provided to the government.<br />16. Business size and any socio-economic factors.</p>
<p>Contract/Pricing information<br />17. What is an estimated price for a one-year cloud service? If the price is based on data volume and/or usage, please provide a pricing model. <br />18. What is an estimated price to extend the service to NIPR and SIPR during two additional option years? <br />19. Please detail any proposed catalog pricing for licenses, subscriptions, storage, usage, processing, etc.<br />20. How would pricing be scaled for up to 300TB of data?<br />21. Please include Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for planning purposes only.</p>

<p>Solicitation: <br />DRC0624201609199</p>
<p>Agency/Office: Washington Headquarters Services</p>
<p>Locations: Defense Acquisition University, Fort Belvoir, Virginia</p>
<p>Title: Campus Aesthetics</p>
<p>Request for Information</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Washington Headquarters Services Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD) on behalf of the Defense Acquisition University (DAU). Note that this is not a request for offers. A determination by the Government not to issue a solicitation based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Responses to this RFI will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government will not pay for the information solicited nor recognize any costs associated with the submission of this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry to enhance the success of any future procurement to meet this requirement. Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited.

As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) about the potentiality that such information may be disclosed to third parties and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information. Responses to this notice are not considered offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<br />Potential small business sources are invited to submit a Capabilities Statement addressing the ability of their company to address the five critical elements listed above. Responses shall not exceed five (5) pages maximum, as described above, to the "Campus Aesthetics".</p>

<CONTACT>Donita J. Furman, Phone 402-762-4145, Fax 402-762-4148, Email donita.furman@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), US Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, NE, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to Neogen-<br />Geneseek located in Lincoln, NE that will provide the genotypes for approximately 230,000 markers on 950 USMARC animals.  The GGP-F250K array offered by Neogen-GeneSeek represents a new set of Bovine markers of which almost 200,000 are classified as functional variant polymorphisms.  These functional variants are selected because, through various procedures, they have been implicated as causing a change in the protein structure of a specific gene or are thought to cause changes in the regulation of a gene.  An additional 34,000 markers are also placed on the array to assist with imputation to other assays (which have been genotyped on several USMARC animals).  Neogen-GeneSeek is the only source of these functional variant makers in a high-throughput (array) form.  NeoGen-Geneseek is the only vender of the GGP-F250K array.  These genotypes can only be obtained through the use of this array or through sequencing as of now and sequencing would be much more expensive.  Neogen-GeneSeek has constructed this array in collaboration with the University of Missouri with some content from the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center.  There is no other source for high-throughput genotyping of these markers.  These markers are unique in that they primarily reflect markers know to cause changes to proteins or to the regulation of proteins.  While these markers are not patented, there is no other method to obtain these genotypes at this cost.
<p>This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotations or proposals. No solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide this service are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a substantive statement with descriptive literature and any other supporting information to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of publication of this notice. All information received within 10 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government to determine if the alternative equipment meets the Government's requirements and is capable of performing the intended task(s). All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to the attention of Donita Furman, fax 402-762-4145, or email at donita.furman@ars.usda.gov. Questions concerning this acquisition must be directed to Donita Furman, email donita.furman@ars.usda.gov.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of Acquisition and Agreements Management (OAAM), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for the Center for Nanoscience and Technology's (CNST) Nanofabrication Research Group (NRG).
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 1901 as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.501.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to procure a K-2 Camera from Gatan under a Firm Fixed Price Contract using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Commercial Items (FAR Parts 12 and 13.5).</p>
<p>The Center for Nanoscience and Technology's Nanofabrication Research Group (NRG) conducts research on the development of innovative metrologies and in situ measurement protocols for micro/nano-scale gas-solid interaction analysis under reactive environments. We are currently using an environmental scanning-transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with electron and optical spectroscopies as a base platform. Measurement techniques are used to determine sample composition as well as structural, electronic, and chemical properties of a wide variety of organic, and inorganic systems where materials of interest are typically present as either micro/nano-scale features or thin films. Reaction conditions used vary in the temperature range of 20 &deg;C to 1300 &deg;C under pressures ranging from 10-4 Pa (10-6 Torr) to 3x103 Pa (20 Torr).</p>
<p>To meet mission requirements; the NRG needs to procure a high speed camera, capable of acquiring atomic resolution images up to a frame rate of 1600 s-1 as well as images with low electron dose to mitigate the sample damage by high energy electrons.</p>
<p>The Gatan K2 camera upgrade for our current FEI environmental scanning/transmission electron microscope (ESTEM), equipped with an image corrector and monochromator, will enable us to collect high-resolution images with a 100 nm x 100 nm field of view at frame rates of up to 1600 s-1, substantially improving our current capability (frame rate of 25 s-1). The Gatan K2 camera will give NIST the highest possible acquisition rate (time resolution) for atomic resolution images to measure the gas-solid reaction rate. Only the Gatan K2 camera is capable of providing 100 percent physical and data compatibility.</p>
<p>Gatan is uniquely qualified to provide the instruments to the CNST NRG based upon the following. Gatan has, solely in the industry and market, developed:</p>
<p>A commercial camera with the capabilities identified above, and are fully (physical and data) compatible with CNSTs microscope (FEI Titan 80-300 KV ETEM, valued at $2.75 million).</p>
<p>Only Gatan's camera is capable of collaborating and physically capable of being installed on the FEI instrumentation. <br />Gatan's camera has the unique proprietary capability of having a detector quantum efficiency (DQE) of 0.5 or higher to acquire atomic resolution images with time resolution of 0.0025 s with 2000 x 2000 pixel resolution.</p>
<p>Gatan camera has a built-in video acquisition and image processing software.</p>
<p>This camera upgrade will benefit CNST NRG in multiple ways: (a) improve the atomic resolution image acquisition time to decipher intermediate steps of a gas-solid and/or liquid solid interaction and (b) image electron beam sensitive polymers and biological materials.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 334516, with a size standard of 1000 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by July 11, 2016 will be considered by the Government.</p>

It is the intent of the National Severe Storms Laboratory to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), as there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate solely with Rotating Precision Mechanisms, Inc., of Northridge, California, for this requirement.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based on the National Severe Storms Laboratory's (NSSL) requirement for spare parts for several key components of a pedestal / elevation rotator being fabricated for use in NSSL's Advanced Technology Demonstrator (ATD) radar. <span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The ATD testbed is being developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL), within the Multimission Phased-Array Radar (MPAR) program.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM (AUG 2012)<br />ACC-APG 5152.233-4900</p>
<p>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible Contracting Officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. Send protests (other than protests to the Contracting Officer) to:</p>
<p>Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command<br />Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road<br />Rm: A6SE040.001<br />Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000<br />Phone: (256) 450-8165<br />Fax: (256) 450-8840<br />E-mail: amcprotests@conus.army.mil</p>
<p>The AMC-Level Protest Procedures are accessible via the Internet at:<br />www.amc.army.mil/amc/commandcounsel.html. If Internet access is not available, contact the Contracting Officer or HQ, AMC, to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures.<br />For questions concerning this solicitation, contact Christopher M. Neville, Contract Specialist, via email at christopher.m.neville2.civ@mail.mil.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)

<p>DESCRIPTION/STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>On June 22, 2009, the President signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) into law (Public Law 111-31).  The Tobacco Control Act amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) and granted the FDA authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health and to reduce tobacco use by minors.  The FDA has authority over cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco.  The FDA has also expressed intent to deem jurisdiction over other tobacco products.</p>
<p>Most tobacco carcinogens are pre-carcinogens that require metabolic activation to exert their effects. Generally, metabolic activation is carried out by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (Rossini et al, Pharmacogenomics 2008). Activation results in formation of a short-lived electrophile that reacts in situ to produce tumors, for instance through DNA adduct formation. Thus, tumor formation is site-specific and will only occur in those tissues expressing the specific CYPs that metabolize tobacco carcinogens, such as NNN and NNK. Surprisingly, few studies have been carried out to visualize the tissue distribution of CYPs involved in the metabolism of NNN and NNK in human samples, except for Chang, H.C. et al., (Respiration, 2012) who examined distribution of CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 within the respiratory tract.  However, the distribution of other CYPs with potential involvement in the metabolism of NNN or NNK has not been established in human tissues.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>Contractor shall conduct the following using Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions:</p>
<p>1.	The contractor shall examine human CYP2A6, CYP2A13, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP1B1 expression in no less than 10 cases per tissue type from normal human bone marrow, lung, kidney, liver, bladder, oral cavity, and esophageal tissues. <br />2.	The contractor shall include detailed experimental methods utilizing antibody-based characterization and visualization techniques with commercially-available human tissue sections. For instance, the offeror may demonstrate tissue localization of CYP proteins using visible or fluorescence-tagged epitopes and microscopic visualization with quantitation. However other methods may be acceptable, e.g. laser-capture microdissection, FISH, tissue microarray.   The specific protocols and method details shall be proposed by the offeror. For instance, the offeror may choose to rely on the manufacturer's published instructions, or to modify such instructions based on their own or others' work. <br />The antibody-based characterization and visualization methods should be appropriate and relevant to characterize the tissue, and ideally, cell type-specific distribution profile of  human CYP2A6, CYP2A13, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6, and CYP1B1 within those human tissues listed above known to be affected by cigarette smoking.  Funding for method development of a new assay or for purchase of new equipment required to perform the assays is not within the scope of this work.  The chosen methods should already be properly validated and verified for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, and be rapid, efficient, and practical as well as well-accepted and the results comparable within the literature.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NIH-NICHD-16-103 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-88. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 813920 and the business size standard is $15.0M. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to contract on a sole source basis with Kaiser Division of Research, 2000 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612 to access Kaiser Permanente's database of patients for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and a variety of health outcomes from the use of alcohol.<br />Background<br />Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a complex and devastating disease, affecting 13.9 percent of Americans in a 1-year period and resulting in a range of medical, psychological, social, economic, and personal problems. Problem drinking costs the U.S. society more than $249 billion annually and causes nearly 88,000 deaths each year. Encouragingly, advances have been made in developing effective treatments for AUD, especially medications. Three medications are approved for alcohol dependence by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): disulfiram, oral and long-acting injectable naltrexone, and acamprosate. In addition, nalmefene was approved in Europe by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of alcohol dependence.<br />Barriers to progress in identifying new medications may lie in clinical trial design, including outcome measures. Perhaps a dozen different outcomes have been used in the 100 or so National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)-funded alcohol pharmacotherapy trials conducted during the past 2 decades. Researchers have predominantly selected primary outcomes that reflect actual quantity and frequency of drinking, as opposed to measures of psychosocial or physical consequences of alcohol consumption, because drinking outcomes are more proximal to the effects of medications and thus appear to be more sensitive in detecting differences between experimental and placebo groups. However, a wide variety of choices exists even among drinking outcomes. <br />The FDA has historically designated total abstinence as the only designated outcome for Phase 3 alcohol trials, a requirement of pharmaceutical companies to receive approval for a New Drug Application (NDA). However, more recently, the FDA has also deemed acceptable another outcome, the percentage of subjects with no heavy drinking days. Previous work has validated these outcomes by showing how reductions in drinking to these levels are associated with improvement in health outcomes. However, in order to achieve a successful response on these outcomes, subjects must substantially reduce their alcohol consumption often from very high starting levels.
<p>It is an empirical question whether lesser reductions in alcohol consumption, and alternative ways of operationalizing reduction, are also associated with improvements in health outcomes. For instance, the EMA accepts a 2-level reduction in a 4-level categorization of drinking risk levels (very high, high, moderate and low) defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in terms of average volume (grams) of ethanol consumed per day (or per drinking day). Little information is available about the degree to which reductions in WHO drinking risk levels are associated with improvements in health outcomes. Moreover, it is unclear whether alternative WHO categories, using different volume cutoffs and alternative ways of expressing drinking (e.g., drinks per drinking day and heavy drinking days), would be produce different degrees of improvement in health outcomes. To produce generalizable and reliable results, validation of the WHO categories (and alternate conceptualizations) must be evaluated longitudinally in a large database of patients in a large healthcare system.<br />Specific Project Requirements<br />The contractor will be responsible for:<br />I. Accessing Kaiser Permanente's database of patients with the following characteristics only: 1) alcohol consumption data with two time points at least 9 months apart (e.g., at patient intake and 9-months thereafter); and 2) a variety of health outcomes must be collected at the same two time points, and ideally after.</p>
<p>II. Conducting analyses to validate how changes in WHO categories (and alternative conceptualizations) correlate with changes in health outcomes. Additional analyses must be conducted to explore moderators of this relationship (e.g., WHO category at intake, and the occurrence/severity of the health outcome at intake).</p>
<p>III. Preparing one high quality manuscript for submission to a peer-reviewed journal describing the background, methods employed, results, limitations, future research and conclusions.</p>
<p>Project Management <br />The contractor will be responsible for:<br />I. Providing for the overall management, integration and coordination of all contract activities, including the management and coordination of activities carried out under subcontracts.</p>
<p>II. Providing a technical and administrative infrastructure to ensure the efficient planning, initiation, implementation and timely completion of all projects carried out under this contract and effective communications with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />III. Provide a Principal Investigator with responsibility for overall project management and communications, tracking, monitoring and reporting on project status and progress, and recommending modifications to project requirements and timelines, including projects undertaken by subcontractors.</p>
<p><br />A. EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that an award under this solicitation shall be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined by the Government to represent the best value to meet the Government's needs. The Technical Proposal shall receive paramount consideration in the selection of the Offeror for this acquisition. All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost or price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more Offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price. In any event, The Government reserves the right to make an award to the Offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the Government. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest benefit in response to the requirement. The technical evaluation shall be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the Vendor set forth in the Technical Proposal. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions if overall best value can be clearly determined and if no other Offeror would have a reasonable chance at award if discussions were conducted. Offerors shall be evaluated in accordance with the factors set forth below. Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other.</p>
<p>The criteria below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes.</p>
<p><br />1. Understanding the Requirement (Technical and Management Approach) 70 Points</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach (30 Points)</p>
<p>a. Understanding and approach to supporting the technical task (aims) as identified in the Statement of Work.<br />b. Specific methods and techniques to be employed with respect to these tasks (aims).<br />c. Knowledge of the applicable technology to be used as described in the Statement of Work.<br />d. Knowledge and experience with the business processes describing the suitability of the offeror (please provide a bibliography of publications relevant to the research).</p>
<p>B. Management Approach (30 Points)</p>
<p>a. Thorough and effective plan or the conduct of the task (aims) activities.<br />b. Appropriate organization and allocation of personnel and resources needed to conduct the tasks (aims) outlined in the Statement of Work, including the methods for interaction and communication with the scientific, technical and administrative staff of NICHD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C. Qualifications (30 Points)</p>
<p>a. Quality, depth and recent experience, education and training of the individual personnel to be assigned to the project.<br />b. Successful performance of tasks similar to the tasks described in the Statement of Work.<br />c. Ability to supply subject matter experts across the entire range of requirements if and as needed over the performance period.</p>
<p>D. Past Performance and Organizational Experience (10 Points)</p>
<p>a. Organization's history of successful completion of projects of similar nature, including the quality of technical performance and adherence to schedule and cost/price.<br />b. Organization's past performance with projects and availability of facilities and equipment appropriate to the project in supporting biomedical research.</p>
<p><br />B. COST/PRICE EVALUATION</p>
<p>Offeror proposed price shall be evaluated on realism and reasonable for the Government to purchase the equipment.</p>
<p>For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.</p>
<p>Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost/price for the equipment in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost/Price realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost/price realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision.</p>
<p><br />C. ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS (These factors will not be evaluated )</p>
<p>Past Performance</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror's past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government.</p>
<p>Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.</p>
<p>The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the capability of the offeror. Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than if it has an acceptable record.</p>
<p>Past performance will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall quality of the offeror's past performance will be influential in determining the merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>By past performance, the Government means the offeror's record of conforming to ns and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the number or severity of an offeror's problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the offeror's overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information.</p>
<p>The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror.</p>
<p>Deliverables<br />At the completion of each completed analyses, contractor will provide results to NIAAA COR for review and feedback.<br />One high quality manuscript for submission to a peer-reviewed journal describing the background, methods employed, results and conclusions. Limitations of the findings as well as directions for future research should be discussed. <br />Final Closeout and Report<br />The Contractor shall ensure an orderly, secure, and efficient closeout of the contract. A description of project activities and a summary of main scientific findings shall be provided in a Draft and Final Report, which will be reviewed and approved by the COR. The Draft Final Report shall be submitted no later than 14 calendar days prior to the completion date of the contract. The Final Report (approved by the COR and Contracting Officer) shall be submitted no later than 3 business days prior to the completion date of the contract.<br />Kaiser Division of Research (DOR) uniquely possesses both the necessary Data and Contractor Requirements as presented in the Statement of Work. DOR houses an extremely rare database of approximately 1 million patients receiving primary care in a large healthcare system (Kaiser Permanente). The database includes sufficient granularity of alcohol consumption data so as to allow computation of all necessary drinking outcomes. Moreover, the database is longitudinal allowing for analysis of long-term health outcomes over time. This is a unique, national database and no other organization known to us possesses the volume and numbers of patient records with the required drinking data and repeated long-term healthcare follow-ups.<br />The statistical team, at DOR possesses and demonstrated technical mastery of the data and statistical procedures to analyze these data, including sophisticated generalized linear models to demonstrate outcome change over time. Kaiser data was used for purposes similar to the needs of NIAAA, namely to validate other drinking outcomes, such as low-risk drinking. <br />To accomplish the aim of this contract, the Contractor must have an extremely large database of patients in a large "real-world" healthcare system so that the analysis results will be generalizable and reliable. Moreover, the database must have sufficiently detailed measures of drinking so as to allow for computation of the WHO risk level categories, and ideally, allow for alternate conceptualizations of risk levels. Finally, the database must be longitudinal and contain drinking and health outcomes at two time points separated by at least 1 year in order to determine how changes in drinking are related to long term changes in health outcomes. Without these data points and volume of patients, we will not be able to sufficiently inform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on how changes in alcohol consumption relate to changes in health outcomes over time and provide a definitive answer on whether the WHO drinking risk level categories are an appropriate endpoint for pharmacotherapy trials to treat alcohol use disorder.<br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. <br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition. The offeror must include their Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />1. BACKGROUND<br />1.1 The United States Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates eighteen (18) HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines. The aircraft is manufactured by AIRBUS MILITARY (formerly EADS CASA) in Seville, Spain. The CT7-9C3 turboprop engines are manufactured by General Electric, Aviation Division of Lynn, MA, USA, Original Equipment Manufacturer, (OEM). While the base CASA CN-235-300M aircraft provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A, changes to the base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M. <br />1.2 This Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) is operated differently from general aviation in support of USCG search and rescue missions, as well as surveillance and reconnaissance missions. USCG HC-144A missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments. These environments accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and components of the aircraft. The aircraft and its components are inspected by USCG personnel In Accordance With (IAW) the OEM periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).<br />2. SCOPE <br />2.1 The scope of this SOW is to obtain repair services for the General Electric (GE) CT7-9C3 turboprop engine power units, modules, and components, listed in the Schedule on an "as required" basis.<br />2.2 Levels of Repair shall be defined as: <br />a. Major Repair -- A "Major" repair consists of a minor repair and the complete disassembly of the engine and inspection of modules as required by Small Engine Instruction (SEI)-576/578 returning the engine to service. The Contractor must review and be in compliance with required service bulletins and Airworthiness Directives (AD), re-assembly of the engine, test and prep-to-ship.</p>
<p>b. Minor Repair -- A "Minor" repair consists of removal of the hot section module, Power Turbine (PT) Module and Accessory Gearbox (AGB). The hot section module and PT module shall be inspected and repaired as required by SEI-576/578. The AGB shall be inspected for obvious damage/defects as required by SEI-576/578. Bore Scope Inspection (BSI) shall be performed on the compressor rotor/stator. Compressor case half shall be removed as required addressing any findings identified during the bore scope inspection. The cold section will be held for re-assembly of the engine. The contractor shall review and be in compliance with required service bulletins and airworthiness directives, re-assembly of the engine, test and prep-to-ship.</p>
<p>c. Test Teardown and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) -- Based on the removal cause and/or time on the engine, a full BSI may be performed to determine the condition of the engine. If the BSI does not accurately determine the condition of the engine, half-casing the compressor may be required for a more detailed inspection. If the removal cause and/or times on the engine were a concern, the engine will be disassembled to module level. If the Government chooses to continue with the contractor for repairs, the cost of TT&amp;E will be included in the repair cost. The Contractor shall submit in writing or via email to the Contracting Officer a proposal for a Minor or Major repair. If approved by the Contracting Officer, a modification will be issued.</p>
<p>d. Performance Run-- Requires ONLY a visual and bore scope inspection (no Teardown) if no discrepancies exist, then complete a Test Cell performance run and provide the findings to the USCG Contracting Officer. If the engine or PGB is found to be in serviceable condition IAW OEM testing specifications, the contractor shall return it to the USCG with an FAA authorized airworthiness form attached.<br />2.3 Repair of listed GE components must be accomplished In Accordance With (IAW) the OEM specifications. This SOW establishes the minimum USCG requirements necessary for repairs of the engine power units, modules, and components and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor detract from the procedures outlined in the manufacturer's drawings, manuals, specifications, and service bulletins. USCG configuration control requires that applicable service bulletins and modifications for all ACMS tracked engine power units, modules, and components not previously configured, shall not be incorporated without prior written approval from the USCG Contracting Officer. <br />2.4 Designated Engineering Representative (DER) repairs: DER repair procedures may be authorized by the USCG Contracting Officer on a case-by-case basis after review by the USCG Engineering Officer. The contractor shall submit a complete technical package to the USCG Contracting Officer for approval showing the proposed DER repair procedure on an FAA form 8110-3 which shall meet the OEM operational requirements. This information will not be released outside of the Government. <br />2.5 The Contractor shall be responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>

Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certifications, and other information required by this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of requirements, contract terms and conditions, or an unrealistically high or low price when compared to Government estimates, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the program. Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all quotes. Only those quotes determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the quotes will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price and technical acceptability. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced quote meeting the acceptability standards for the non-priced factors. TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARD: The contractor shall address the following two factors: 1. Factor 1 ? Technical Capability ? Offeror shall clearly demonstrate its approach to technical ability to meet the requirements of CLIN/Line Items based on meeting the requirements of the Request for Quote, quantity, quality and timeliness of delivery. 2. Factor 2 ? Price ? The offeror shall complete CLIN pricing. In addition to the completed CLIN pricing, the offeror shall provide sufficient price information to allow the contracting officer to determine the completeness and reasonableness of the offerors prices. DISCUSSIONS: If during the evaluation period it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to clarifications/discussion notices will be considered in making the source selection decision. <BR> <BR>AWARD DECISION: The award decisions will be made as follows: (1) Step One ? Determine Technical Acceptability. The technical evaluation, Factor 1, stated above, will assess the offerors capability to satisfy the Government?s requirement. The Government will evaluate all technical capability quotes received by the required date/time. The Technical Capability factor will receive a rating of acceptable and unacceptable. If any factor is rated ?unacceptable?, the entire quote is rendered technically unacceptable, and the quote will be removed from the competitive range. Only quotes deemed technically acceptable (either initially or as the result of discussions) will be considered for award. The ratings are defined in the following table. Rating Description Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Only those quotes determined acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussion will be considered for award. Once deemed acceptable, all technical quotes are considered to be equal. Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Quotes with an unacceptable rating will not be considered for award. Table A-1 (2) Step Two ? Evaluate Price. The offeror?s Price quote will be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed as annotated under Factor 2 ? Price. (3) Step Three ? Award Decision. Award will be made the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination in accordance with FAR Part 9 and conformance of the offeror?s quote to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. DISCLAIMER: This is a request for the submission of a quote and does not constitute a contract or authorization to begin work. Nor does an offeror?s submission of a quote constitute a contract or authorize the individual or company to being work. <BR> <BR>

L. 113-235), Government agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.
(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.
(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. <BR> <BR>Invoicing Procedures - Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (a)	Definitions.

Inquiries regarding invoices should be e-mailed to BLSInvoiceInquiry@dol.gov.  The relevant invoice must be attached to the inquiry e-mail and the subject line of the e-mail must state ?INQUIRY,? followed by the information described in paragraph (1) d. above.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />1. BACKGROUND<br />1.1 The United States Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates eighteen (18) HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines. The aircraft is manufactured by AIRBUS MILITARY (formerly EADS CASA) in Seville, Spain. The CT7-9C3 turboprop engines are manufactured by General Electric, Aviation Division of Lynn, MA, USA, Original Equipment Manufacturer, (OEM). While the base CASA CN-235-300M aircraft provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A, changes to the base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M. <br />1.2 This Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) is operated differently from general aviation in support of USCG search and rescue missions, as well as surveillance and reconnaissance missions. USCG HC-144A missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments. These environments accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and components of the aircraft. The aircraft and its components are inspected by USCG personnel In Accordance With (IAW) the OEM periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).<br />2. SCOPE <br />2.1 The scope of this SOW is to obtain repair services for the General Electric (GE) CT7-9C3 turboprop engine power units, modules, and components, listed in the Schedule on an "as required" basis.<br />2.2 Levels of Repair shall be defined as: <br />a. Major Repair -- A "Major" repair consists of a minor repair and the complete disassembly of the engine and inspection of modules as required by Small Engine Instruction (SEI)-576/578 returning the engine to service. The Contractor must review and be in compliance with required service bulletins and Airworthiness Directives (AD), re-assembly of the engine, test and prep-to-ship.</p>
<p>b. Minor Repair -- A "Minor" repair consists of removal of the hot section module, Power Turbine (PT) Module and Accessory Gearbox (AGB). The hot section module and PT module shall be inspected and repaired as required by SEI-576/578. The AGB shall be inspected for obvious damage/defects as required by SEI-576/578. Bore Scope Inspection (BSI) shall be performed on the compressor rotor/stator. Compressor case half shall be removed as required addressing any findings identified during the bore scope inspection. The cold section will be held for re-assembly of the engine. The contractor shall review and be in compliance with required service bulletins and airworthiness directives, re-assembly of the engine, test and prep-to-ship.</p>
<p>c. Test Teardown and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) -- Based on the removal cause and/or time on the engine, a full BSI may be performed to determine the condition of the engine. If the BSI does not accurately determine the condition of the engine, half-casing the compressor may be required for a more detailed inspection. If the removal cause and/or times on the engine were a concern, the engine will be disassembled to module level. If the Government chooses to continue with the contractor for repairs, the cost of TT&amp;E will be included in the repair cost. The Contractor shall submit in writing or via email to the Contracting Officer a proposal for a Minor or Major repair. If approved by the Contracting Officer, a modification will be issued.</p>
<p>d. Performance Run-- Requires ONLY a visual and bore scope inspection (no Teardown) if no discrepancies exist, then complete a Test Cell performance run and provide the findings to the USCG Contracting Officer. If the engine or PGB is found to be in serviceable condition IAW OEM testing specifications, the contractor shall return it to the USCG with an FAA authorized airworthiness form attached.<br />2.3 Repair of listed GE components must be accomplished In Accordance With (IAW) the OEM specifications. This SOW establishes the minimum USCG requirements necessary for repairs of the engine power units, modules, and components and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor detract from the procedures outlined in the manufacturer's drawings, manuals, specifications, and service bulletins. USCG configuration control requires that applicable service bulletins and modifications for all ACMS tracked engine power units, modules, and components not previously configured, shall not be incorporated without prior written approval from the USCG Contracting Officer. <br />2.4 Designated Engineering Representative (DER) repairs: DER repair procedures may be authorized by the USCG Contracting Officer on a case-by-case basis after review by the USCG Engineering Officer. The contractor shall submit a complete technical package to the USCG Contracting Officer for approval showing the proposed DER repair procedure on an FAA form 8110-3 which shall meet the OEM operational requirements. This information will not be released outside of the Government. <br />2.5 The Contractor shall be responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested. This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, documentation, preservation, and shipping of the CT7-9C3 engine power units, modules, and components. <br />2.6 Test cell runs must be accomplished on test cells certified as correlated to the CT7-9C3 engine OEM test cells. <br />2.7 The contractor shall track and document for USCG specialized ACMS and Significant Component History Reports (SCHR) the necessary calendar time, flight time, and appropriate flight cycle requirement for the CT7-9C3 engine power units, modules, and components which must be accomplished to maintain the integrity of any OEM high-time hourly intervals and life cycle limits. <br />2.8 The contractor shall maintain a current list and status of all OEM Component Maintenance Manuals (CMM), Shop Manuals(SM) including Revisions (Rev), Temporary Revisions (TR), Service Bulletins (SB), Modifications (MOD), Amendments (AMD) or other specifications applicable to the overhaul, repair and modification of the USCG CT7-9C3 engine power units, modules, and components.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: <br />(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. <br />(3) Certain transfers disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>

Technical tradeoff will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certifications, and other information required by this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of requirements, contract terms and conditions, or an unrealistically high or low price when compared to Government estimates, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the program. Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all quotes. Only those quotes determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the quotes will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price and technical acceptability. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced quote meeting the acceptability standards for the non-priced factors. TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARD: The contractor shall address the following two factors: 1. Factor 1 ? Technical Capability ? Offeror shall clearly demonstrate its approach to technical ability to meet the requirements of CLIN/Line Items based on meeting the requirements of the Request for Quote, quantity, quality and timeliness of delivery. 2. Factor 2 ? Price ? The offeror shall complete CLIN pricing. In addition to the completed CLIN pricing, the offeror shall provide sufficient price information to allow the contracting officer to determine the completeness and reasonableness of the offerors prices. DISCUSSIONS: If during the evaluation period it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to clarifications/discussion notices will be considered in making the source selection decision. <BR> <BR>AWARD DECISION: The award decisions will be made as follows: (1) Step One ? Determine Technical Acceptability. The technical evaluation, Factor 1, stated above, will assess the offerors capability to satisfy the Government?s requirement. The Government will evaluate all technical capability quotes received by the required date/time. The Technical Capability factor will receive a rating of acceptable and unacceptable. If any factor is rated ?unacceptable?, the entire quote is rendered technically unacceptable, and the quote will be removed from the competitive range. Only quotes deemed technically acceptable (either initially or as the result of discussions) will be considered for award. The ratings are defined in the following table. Rating Description Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Only those quotes determined acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussion will be considered for award. Once deemed acceptable, all technical quotes are considered to be equal. Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Quotes with an unacceptable rating will not be considered for award. Table A-1 (2) Step Two ? Evaluate Price. The offeror?s Price quote will be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed as annotated under Factor 2 ? Price. (3) Step Three ? Award Decision. Award will be made the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination in accordance with FAR Part 9 and conformance of the offeror?s quote to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. DISCLAIMER: This is a request for the submission of a quote and does not constitute a contract or authorization to begin work. Nor does an offeror?s submission of a quote constitute a contract or authorize the individual or company to being work. <BR> <BR>

<p>The proposed contract is a three-year indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery (IDIQ), firm-fixed-price contract with a three-year ordering period. There is 120,000 pounds minimum guaranteed quantity, and an estimated maximum quantity of 2,000,000 pounds of Ammonium Perchlorate that could be ordered during the life of the contract. Orders will be funded and placed on an as needed basis.</p>
<p>Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) shall adhere to the following: Ammonium Perchlorate, White Granular, Crystalline Solid having a minimum purity of 98.0%, a nominal content of 0.2% Tricalcium Phosphate (TCP) as a conditioner, and a nominal particle size of 200 microns in accordance with MIL-DTL-32103, and all references to weapon specification (WS) 18485A, and AFX-757. Ammonium Perchlorate shall be packaged in 500 pound containers. The offeror is responsible for complying with all of the costs associated with the pre-award qualification, manufacturing verification, and material restriction except for Government travel and Government testing.</p>
<p>Pre-Award qualification includes offerors providing a certificate of conformance and certificate of analysis with full analytical results listed for that specific lot, providing a 2 lb. sample for Government testing, in accordance with MIL-DTL-32103, (WS) 18485A Table II Granulation as determined by Sieve Analysis (Ammonium Perchlorate for use in PBX Explosives), AFX-757. Manufacturer shall be a United States based concern with all production occurring within the United States. Vendors shall provide a minimum of a five (5) pound qualification sample, up to a maximum of a 20 pound qualification sample to the Government for mixing and production of AFX-757 explosive.

The required samples shall be presented to the Government for inspection within 30 days after the solicitation closing date for Government testing to determine compliance with WS 18485A, and processing to produce acceptable MIL-DTL-32103 (Explosive, Plastic-Bonded, CAST AFX-757). The Government will then notify the contractor of conditional approval, conditional approval, or disapproval of the submitted samples. Due to the importance of the particle size distribution of AP and the material's natural tendencies to absorb moisture, causing clumping/caking/deliquescence, the AP shall be subjected to granulation requirements of (WS) 18485A, Table II, for each lot of material provided to the Government. The AP shall also be free flowing. For the purposes of the inspections, one lot of material shall consist of material manufactured in one continuous operation unless the material has been homogeneously blended together.

Material will not be accepted for pre-award testing unless the Government witnessed the manufacturing of the material (batch). The Government reserves the right to waive any or all requirements for the pre-award qualification, site visit, based on verifiable offerors who regularly engage in the manufacture of AP material and provide proof that they have previously made and supplied an AP that was produced, presented, accepted, and consumed by the Government for MCAAP.</p>

<p>ANSWER: For purposes of the sources sought, involvement of a party in multiple responses is acceptable; each resulting business entity should submit a separate response. Note, however, that for purposes of an eventual solicitation, if multiple offers as joint ventures and various other business entities are pursued, parties must be mindful of practices or events that may evidence violations of&nbsp;the antitrust laws (reference FAR 3.303(c)).</p>

<p>QUESTION: For past acquisitions for the 40mm grenade family, the M918 and M385A1 projectile assemblies were provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM). Has this changed?</p>
<p>ANSWER: At this time, a decision on GFM has not been made.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The work consists of inspection, testing, repair, and final machining of pump and turbine components.  Work includes: testing and inspection of bearings to confirm the usability and repairs if needed and approved; final machining of the wear ring on a spare turbine runner; and inspection and refurbishing the existing turbine runner including the installation of a new wear ring and the inspection and repair of the existing impeller.  The contractor shall be responsible for all labor, materials, and supplies to rebuild and test the turbine and pump, and pick-up and delivery.  Reclamation recognizes that without dismantling the pump prior to complete diagnoses, a complete statement of work is not available.  Firm fixed price tasks will be addressed in the solicitation.  Any additional work (determined necessary during the inspection) that is NOT defined in the solicitation will be addressed after award via modification.  Additional work will be negotiated with a Reclamation Contracting Officer and the contractor.  The turbine is a James Leffel and Company turbine and the pump is a Worthington Hydrocone Pump.  Known condition at time of last operation is that the turbine and pump were fully operational.  This requirement is being issued as a full and open competition.  The product services code is J043.  An electronic copy of the Request for Quotation will be posted in the near future.  Price, experience, technical, and branch location will be evaluated to determine the awardee.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 334519 with the related size standard of 500 employees (or dollars). The Offeror shall be actively registered with that NAICS or a similar NAICS with the appropriate size standard prior to Award to be considered for any resulting contract. Failure to be properly registered under the appropriate size standard during evaluation and/or at the time of award deems the offer ineligible for award. A similar NAICS Code with the appropriate size standard other than the NAICS Code identified in this buy term may be used as a factor to determine technical capability. (Size standards do not apply to unrestricted set-aside solicitation/RFQ). <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: David W. Reynolds Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 240-3198 Email: david.w.reynolds.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received as a result of this posted market survey request. No additional market survey responses will be accepted at this time. If a solicitation is released, it will be released on the FAA Contract Opportunities Page, https://faaco.faa.gov.


1. When was the supplied CONOPS written?
The CONOPS was written a couple of years ago, but was recently updated for this market survey. 

2. Is the system still using oracle Workflow?
Yes Oracle is still the backbone workflow.

3. Are the non-functional standards-based requirements going to be formally tested? 
Yes all requirements will be tested.

4. Does the APWS team have its own operations staff or are they used to a shared operations model?
Operational support is provided by the FAAs Shared IT Services group, with local support provided at MMAC.

5. Are the system back-up capabilities in existence today?
All backup capabilities are already in place as part of the operational support.

6. Who owns the ESB mentioned in the APWS -  this program or another one?  Will there be a program level ESB?
The ESB exists for the support of all applications under the Instrument Flight Procedures Automation (IFPA) tool suite.

7. Which of the interfaces mentioned in the RFI exist today?
Interfaces exist for AIRNAV, IFP-SIAP, IFP-FIX, IFP-ROUTES, IFP-DEPARTURES, PIT, IPDS, TARGETS, & FOMS

8. If all the requirements are defined up front -  what is the envisioned change management process?
Change management will be required for changing business requirements over the course of the APWS development.

9. The RFI mentions page limits for some sections  yet it appears that none of the sections mention page limits  does that mean none of them are constrained?
The only item in the RFI that had a page limit is 4.b. Contractor Capabilities.

10. Is the envisioned agile development approach SCRUM?
Yes SCRUM style is envisioned. It may have to be modified depending on the location of the contractor and the development environment.

11. Is test driven development desired? 
Yes where appropriate. The integration complexity does not always lend itself to true test driven development but that should be employed to the extent possible.

12. If we were to suggest a change management phase be undertaken at the beginning of the project in order to revisit the existing workflows in an attempt to define theto-be workflows would that be well received?
We would certainly listen and entertain all suggestions, however both the to-be and as-is workflows are well defined

13. What is believed to be the primary contributing factor to the high latency worklists?
High latency may or may not have been caused by volume of data and/or incorrect indexing.

<p>1. RFP Section L contains important information for proposal preparation. RFP Section M sets forth the evaluation criteria and method for award.</p>
<p>2. The Government intends to award the contract resulting from this solicitation without discussions. See Section L provision 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition (JAN 2004). To facilitate this process, we would like to avoid situations where proposals include substantive exceptions to the proposed contract terms and conditions, which might be unacceptable to the Government and, therefore, preclude award. The resolution of any exceptions to the proposed contract terms and conditions prior to receipt of proposals will aid the Government in its intention to award without discussions and thus streamline the procurement process.</p>
<p>3. The SPSC procurement will be conducted as a competitive SBA-Certified 8(a) Small Business set-aside. NAICS code 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, Size Standard of $20.5M is applicable to this procurement.</p>

<p>5. Provision L.9, 1852.2115-81 Proposal Page Limitations, includes specific page limitation and format requirements. PAGES SUBMITTED IN EXCESS OF THE LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THIS PROVISION WILL NOT BE EVALUATED BY THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>6. Provisions L.9, L.10, L.12, and L.13 contain the proposal due date and delivery requirements. Offerors are reminded to ensure their selected customers know to submit the Past Performance Questionnaires to the larc-spsc@mail.nasa.gov inbox by the proposal due date.</p>
<p>7. Provisions L.14, M.2, M.3, and M.4 contain important information on proposal evaluation. NOTE: Provision L.14(a)(1)1.2, which is a technical proposal consideration regarding the proposed listing of contractor-provided equipment, states that if an offeror is proposing alternative equipment from what is defined in the PWS, the offeror must also provide a product specification sheet with the make and model number of all alternative equipment 7 business days prior to proposal submission date specific in Block 9 of the SF 33.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">NHTSA has established national goals to increase seat belt usage to 89 percent and reduce alcohol-impaired fatalities to 39 percent by 2013.&nbsp; To meet these goals, NHTSA headquarters, the 10 Regional Offices, the States, and our partners must be able to coordinate their activities and work together in a consistent and predictable manner.&nbsp; Law enforcement agencies represent one of NHTSA&rsquo;s strongest and most important partners, and their participation in enforcement efforts to support the agency&rsquo;s goals is critical to continued success.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The NHTSA Regional Offices require assistance to secure and coordinate State LEL activities and focus attention on NHTSA national priorities to secure the participation of law enforcement agencies within their States.&nbsp; State and local agencies are key to delivering highly visible and effective enforcement of traffic laws.&nbsp; To accomplish our mission, law enforcement agencies need to become familiar with NHTSA&rsquo;s priorities and programs and have the ability to seek out and obtain technical support.&nbsp; Regional Law Enforcement Liaisons (LELs) will provide this type of support in concert with the National LEL Program and State efforts for the greatest consistency and continuity of effort.</p>

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice announces a future solicitation and contract for painting the exteriors of several historic buildings at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site in Vancouver, WA, and Oregon City, OR.  The electronic Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on approximately June 28, 2016, at www.FBO.gov.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The work of this contract consists of the preparation, repair, priming, and painting of the exterior of various historic structures. Painting surfaces include exterior trim and moldings, exterior doors and windows, exterior siding, masonry, decking, railings, and stairs. Coatings may include primers, lead control primers, oil base and latex paints, solid coat and semi-transparent stains, polyurethanes, and lacquers.  Prior to painting it may be necessary to repair some surfaces to an acceptable condition.  The buildings included in this contract are historic and it is highly likely that exterior surfaces contain lead-based paint; asbestos-containing materials may also be present.  Several buildings will be occupied and open to the public during contract performance. 
The RFP price schedule includes three buildings as the base award, with four additional buildings listed as options.  The Government may exercise options for the additional buildings at award or up to 60 days thereafter, in any combination or quantity at its sole discretion.
Additional details will be provided in the Statement of Work and drawings posted with the Request for Proposals.  A bid (offer) guarantee (20%), payment bond (100%), performance bond (100%), and liability insurance will be required prior to contract performance.
PROJECT LOCATION:  Most buildings are located within  square mile of one another and of the park's administrative building at 612 E. Reserve St, Vancouver, WA 98661.  One building, the McLoughlin House, is located at 713 Center Street, Oregon City, OR 97045.  Maps and information about the park may be viewed at www.nps.gov/FOVA.
SITE VISIT: The site visit planned for Wednesday, June 29, 2016, is hereby postponed.  A new site visit date and time will be provided in the RFP.  Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged (not mandatory).  More details will be provided in the RFP.
DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement set-aside for eligible women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.15.  The NAICS code for this project is 238320 and the small business size standard is $15 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  All work will be performed under a single firm-fixed-price construction contract subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $250,000 and $500,000 for the base items, with the potential value as high as $700,000 if all options are exercised. 
The RFP will require offerors to submit both a technical and a price proposal; the government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price and award to the firm whose offer represents the best value. Prior to the solicitation closing date, all offerors must establish and/or maintain an active registration and complete the online representations and certifications at www.SAM.gov as well as comply with the WOSB program requirements in FAR Part 19.15.  
The solicitation (RFP) will be issued electronically and posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website on approximately June 20, 2016.  Responses will be due approximately 30 days thereafter, unless extended.  The entire solicitation package, including drawings and specifications, will be in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF. Offerors will submit their proposals in digital format per instructions included in the solicitation.
Prospective offerors must visit FBO periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents; no notifications will be sent.   No paper copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued.  All eligible responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the National Park Service, however offerors who have not completed the SAM or WOSB requirements prior to the RFP due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<CONTACT>Ward, Evans
<DESC>SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION: The National Park Service hereby issues a Request For Quotations from Small Business concerns for the potential award of a single, firm-fixed price contract to replace progressive cavity grinder pumps at Gulf Islands National Seashore in nearby Pensacola Beach, Florida.  If awarded, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, material, tools, supervision and equipment necessary for the turn-key replacement of grinder pumps and retrofit control box at two (2) sites within the Fort Pickens Area and one (1) site within the Santa Rosa Area situated on a coastal barrier island. Submersible motor pumps used in pumping stations require wet-installed pumps that are located directly in the pump sump. Wet installation requires a lifting chain or a rod system to lower the submersible motor pump into its final installation position and lift it out again as necessary. Monitoring sensors are fitted to the submersible motor as standard in order to prevent any water or moisture from entering the motor.  Estimated price range is between $25,000 and $100,000. Contract duration is 60 days after Receipt of Order (ARO). Anticipated period of performance: July 11, 2016 through August 9, 2016. A pre-bid Site Visit to examine conditions and existing systems may be made by contacting the Project Manager Marty Nogues, Phone: (850) 232-3636 cell or 850-934-2627 office or Email: m_nogues@nps.gov.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><strong><br />AMENDMENT 0001 TO THE SYNOPSIS</strong></span></span></p>
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the synopsis response date was fifteen (15) days from the synopsis issue date of 26 May 2016 in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) which would have concluded on 10 June 2016. However, the government will still accept capability statements from interested offerors through Thursday 30 June 2016. The synopsis stated in error that a solicitation of this anticipated sole source procurement would be available for download from the FBO website on or about 22 June 2016. No solicitation will be posted, but a copy will be made available upon request. The synopsis should have stated that the government will consider capability statements received within the identified synopsis response time for the announcement.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who request a copy of the solicitation will receive any amendment issued prior to the closing date.</p>
<p>Questions or inquiries should be directed to Mr. Jesse Mechinus, Code 0242, telephone (812)854-3554 or send a request via e-mail (E-MAIL preferred) to jesse.mechinus@navy.mil. Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Notice: Request for Proposal SOL-R5-16-00001

NOTICE: This is a Solicitation notice.  Attached is a Request for Proposal.  No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  This solicitation utilizes the policies and procedures governing competitive negotiated acquisitions described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 5 Water Division (WD), Ground Water Drinking Water Branch requires technical assistance and capacity development services to develop and build the necessary technical, managerial and financial capacity of tribal Public Water Systems compliance with the objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Tribal locations in Minnesota include the counties of Becker, Beltrami, Carlton, Cass, Clearwater, Cook, Goodhue, Hubbard, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake of the Woods, Mahnomen, Marshall, Mille Lacs, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake, Redwood, Roseau, Scott, St. Louis, and Yellow Medicine.

Tribal locations in Wisconsin include the counties of Ashland, Bayfield, Burnett, Forest, Jackson, Outagamie, Sawyer, Shawano, and Vilas.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541620 "Environmental Consulting Services" with a small business size standard of $15 million. The associated product service code is R410, "Support- Professional Program Evaluation//Review/Development".

All offeror's must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ to be considered a Responsible Offeror and be eligible for award.

In August 2016, the Government anticipates awarding ONE hybrid performance-based service contract with firm-fixed-price task contract line item numbers, negotiated fixed price tasks orders, and for Time-and-Material for incidental moderate to high-risk action for a five year period.

The Agency has determined this requirement has potential organizational conflict of interests with firms directly engaged in or if it has a business or financial relationship(s) with firms who "Own, design, engineer, manufacture, operate, distribute, or invest in entities subject to Safe Drinking Water Act regulations, policies, guidelines, criteria, etc., and consultants to such entities, Point-of-Use/Point-of-Entry (POU/POE) treatment devices, water treatment equipment or chemicals, well drilling, suppliers of drinking water, and/or community water systems".  With proper disclosure and appropriate action, an offeror could avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the potential conflict, therefore, no offeror's are restricted from submitting a proposal.

New Port Richey, FL

Notice:  This is not a solicitation for offers, nor is it a request for proposals. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this advertisement.

If, you have previously submitted a site for this solicitation, then there is no need to resubmit.  Your submission(s) are still under review and you will be notified upon completion of the new Market Survey.  VA will consider space located in an existing building as well as land for new construction.  NUSF is generally defined as the space remaining once common areas, lessor areas, and areas required by code are deducted from the rentable square feet of the facility.  NUSF does not include areas such as stairs, elevators, mechanical and utility rooms, ducts, shafts, vestibules, public corridors and public toilets required by local code.  A detailed definition will be provided by VA, should a solicitation for offers or request for proposals be issued for this project. 

Existing Space:

<DESC><p>Description:<br />Polypropylene Copolymer Plastic Tubes 13 X 100 MM W/Plastic push in caps. Packed: 1000 Tubes per box with 1100 Caps per box PART # 55.516.009.<br />Quantiy - 1600 boxes</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.202(2) Exceptions. <br />The contracting officer need not submit the notice required by 5.201 when- <br />The contracting officer determines that- <br /><br />The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in 6.302-2 (or, for purchases conducted using simplified acquisition procedures, if unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition to the maximum extent practicable) and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in&nbsp; FAR 5.203</p>
<p>The formal solicitation # AG-6395-S-16-0073 published 02/23/2016, which was a small business set aside under NAICS - 339112 Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing SBSize - 1,000 employees closed on 04/01/2016. An the alternate product offered is currently undergoing First Article Test procedures.<br /><br />The quantity of 1600 boxes is an interim order which is needed urgently for USDA Veterinary Services to continue their program requirements at several VS facilities throughout the U.S. The Kansas City Facility orders and stocks these tubes in their warehouse to be sent to several VS facilities all over the U.S. to draw blood samples from animals for lab analysis. <br /><br />Sarstedt item 55.516.009 is a custom product that is manufactured by Sarstedt exclusively for the USDA and is not available through any distribution channels<br /><br />Contracting Officer has determined that:<br />A formal synopsis/solicitation process at this time would have caused substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through more competition and would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>

The program office submitted the J&amp;A following the template that AQM had distributed for a sole source procurement under simplified acquisition procedures. In summary, the program office looked at every known news and information collection and distribution support software service, and found that only InfoDesk software services can provide real-time access to newsfeeds, and capability to access and process a wide range of newsfeeds.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1.	ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA251-16-AP-4251	1A. PROJECT/TASK No. N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$16,050.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Dr. Matthew Allen, a VA funded researcher at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center (RLRVAMC) requires specific fluorescently labelled compounds for his VA funded Study  "Treating Bone Deterioration Associated with Chronic Kidney Disease".

5-FAM-ZOL - 3x1000nmol - 1 EA
	
Biovinc, LLC, 1421 State St. Ste B, Santa Barbara, CA 03101

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

The fluorescence compound must be linked specifically to zoledronate.  This specific compound is key to his research projects.  BioVinc guarantees the compound retains its biological efficacy despite the fluorescent tag.  Additionally, BioVinc has expertise in bone to assist if any issues arise. Dr. Allen researched other vendors and did not find another source that could provide specifically:  flouroescence compound linked to zoledronate.
4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market Research was conducted on the internet and another vendor was not found that could provide the specific compound that is required to complete Dr. Allen's research projects. An intent to Sole Source was also posted to FBO with no responses from other vendors saying they could provide similar items and it would be to the VA's advantage to compete the order. 

5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.
