EES productions generally fall into one of three categories: 1) live satellite broadcasts from EES studios, 2) field-based documentary or news magazine shoots, or 3) "film-style" shoots (with scripts, scenes, actors, locations, etc.) On occasion, EES also produces and distributes Public Service Announcements.     Production services may be required at each of the studio locations or on location at a VA or other facility nationwide. Production services may be required on short notice on the day services are required. Production shall follow accepted broadcast industry standards for pre-production, production, and post-production. Production Crewing services may be required locally for cities and sites nationwide across the continental US.    The Contracting Officer may request proposals for the types of services in Paragraph 4, Performance Requirements, or the Contracting Officer will order services on a daily or weekly basis as required using the Work Request form at the end of this section. The Contractor shall submit individual proposals when requested by the Contracting Officer that may result in a firm fixed price task order or a labor hour or time and materials type task order for this contract. The Contracting Officer will submit work statements to the Contractor for the basis of the proposal. The Contractor shall provide a cost-price breakdown to the Contracting Officer with each proposal to include major components of the project and showing the costs and prices associated with each component using the rates and prices negotiated for this contract and included in the List of Rates and Prices of this contract. The proposal shall also contain the telephone numbers and email addresses for its contractual and technical representatives who may be contacted at any time during regular working hours, and an emergency number at which the Contractor may be contacted in situations requiring immediate attention. This Contractor representative shall have full power and authority to act on behalf of the Contractor. The resulting task order will be placed in accordance with the Ordering Clause and will contain the requirements at Attachment A. Any task order work requests issued against task orders shall be approved by the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), and be accepted by the Contractor before performance by the Contractor. In situations where the signatures of all the designated VA staff approvals cannot be secured in time to meet the needs of the present, the missing signatures shall be provided by no later than the following business day.      In no event, will the contractor accept or perform under a Work Request or Task Order that exceeds the total amount of funding available under the task order at the time the work request is issued, or that extends beyond the end of the task order period of performance. All task orders are subject to the Delivery Order Limitations clause. 2. BACKGROUND. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Employee Education System (EES) provides training, employee development programs, and information dissemination programs to all employees of VA nationwide as well as affiliated target audiences in other federal agencies (i.e., DOD, HHS, etc.) through a variety of multimedia and blended learning approaches. EES performs this mission by producing comprehensive video, live satellite television, and interactive programming produced at studios located in Washington DC; Saint Louis, MO; and Salt Lake City, UT. It is the intention of EES to award one or more IDIQ's in each of these three markets. 3. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE The Contract COTR for each location will be identified upon awarding of contracts. The Task Order COTR will be listed out in each Task Order Work Statement. 4. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS     a. Crew Members. All crew members must perform with professional broadcast quality expertise. All members of the production team shall be experienced video/film professionals with professional experience sufficient and specific to their assigned position to ensure the required level of quality of the production. All crew members must be trained in the use of the equipment necessary to perform their duties. If crew members need training on specific pieces of EES-owned equipment, it is the contractor's responsibility to provide that training (prior to production), at no cost to the Government. Task Area 1: Broadcast Services Live Satellite Broadcasts from EES Facilities - EES maintains four fully-equipped broadcast studios, strategically located across the country. There are two broadcast facilities in Washington DC; one in St. Louis, MO; and one in Salt Lake City, UT. The majority of live (and live-to-tape) broadcasts will originate from these studios. The contractor will regularly be required to supply crew members for broadcasts from these locations. Remote Local Broadcasts - In order to accommodate the requirement to record or broadcast conferences and meetings from remote locations, the contractor may be required to supply crew, a field switcher pack, and - depending on the particular task and site - a satellite uplink truck. Task Area 2: Field Production Services (ENG/EFP)     EES often deploys Electronic News Gathering and Electronic Filed Production (ENG/EFP) crews to field locations to acquire material to support its broadcasts and video programs.  These field shoots typically involve conducting interviews and acquiring supporting b-roll. ENG/EFP crews may be required anywhere in the United States.     A typical ENG/EFP crew includes a videographer and an audio engineer. Shoots may or may not involve the personal participation of an EES producer. If EES does not provide a producer, the contractor may be required to do so.     All members of the production team shall be experienced video/film professionals with experience sufficient and specific to their assigned position to ensure the high level of quality as required by VA and with experience specific to the production of EES shows.     EES may or may not provide video production equipment. In the event that EES does not provide equipment, the contractor will be required to do so.     Deliverables include: camera masters of shot footage, field logs taken during the shoot, and releases signed by shoot subjects.       All shot footage shall become the property of the Department of Veterans Affairs and shall be delivered as and when requested. The contractor agrees to make no claims regarding ownership of the footage or copyright of said footage.  Task Area 3: Video Production (Film-style) Required services may include the following typical video program production components: (1) Pre-Production Phase     (a) The contractor will work with the EES Producer and his/her client to identify program objectives and target audiences.     (b) The contractor will prepare a program design outline for review and approval by the EES Producer.      (c) The contractor will write a treatment and first, second, and third drafts of a shooting script (when requested), working closely with the EES Producer and the client to develop a script to that meets the client's needs.     (d) Based on the script, the contractor will prepare and submit a budget and a complete schedule for the program production phase for review and approval by the EES Producer.     (e) The contractor will conduct a location scout, and secure permission and permits for location shooting from the appropriate authorities when applicable.     (f) The contractor will conduct a casting session, when applicable. This casting session shall be videotaped, so that the EES Producer and the client can sign off on all casting decisions.     (g) The contractor will "break down" the script, develop storyboards, and establish a production schedule that makes efficient use of time, crew, and talent.     (h) The contractor will make travel arrangements for contract personnel, including all transportation and hotel accommodations.     (i) The contractor will work with local contacts to schedule; times, locations, people, and security clearances for all production shooting. (2) Production Phase     (a) The contractor will acquire all media required for successful completion of the project.  Media (videotapes, etc.) will be clearly labeled with time, date, and project information.  Detailed production notes will be taken to streamline post-production.       (b) The contractor will provide a professional crew for video, lighting, sound, graphics, production services, and direction. The contractor will provide locations, sets, props, and actors as necessary. The contractor will provide all necessary equipment that is not furnished by EES.  Specific pieces of rental equipment will be discussed, agreed to, and included in the task order prior to production.       (c) EES considers a standard production day to be 10 hours (from arrival on the set to departure from the set). A standard lunch break is 30 minutes. Overtime, computed at a rate of 1.5 times the crew member's regular hourly rate, begins after 10 hours on the set. The contractor will be expected to minimize overtime expenses to the extent possible. The contractor will also be expected to estimate any potential overtime expenses and include them in budget submitted during the preproduction phase.     (d) EES does not provide meals or craft services.  It is the contractor's responsibility to provide these items as required by local industry standards. (3) Post-Production Phase     (a) The contractor shall review and assemble all footage and other materials to be inserted in the final product and prepare a detailed plan for editing the finished product for approval by the client office and EES Producer.     (b) The contractor shall schedule editing time in EES Avid Editing Suites, contract post-production facilities, or other sites as required.     (c) The contractor shall prepare a "paper edit" and a "rough cut" edit of the program for review and revisions by the VA customer and the EES Producer.     (d) Based on this input, the contractor shall prepare the final program master for review and approval by the customer office and the EES Producer. The contractor will be responsible for creating graphics & animation, color correcting video, and mixing and/or sweetening audio as necessary.      (e) The contractor shall use defined VA/EES established logos and crediting standards for all programming credits.     (f)  Upon final approval, the contractor shall prepare master videotapes and/or DVD's with all necessary captioning and chapter authoring. All masters shall comply with NTSC standards.

A few proposals will also be accepted for the winter (October through February) of Fiscal Year 2009. Project proposals must demonstrate a strong relationship between a non-federal group and an Alaskan U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office. This is the initial announcement for this funding opportunity. The CCS program is an annual funding source set up on the federal fiscal year schedule; therefore, the objectives and work identified in the proposals selected for award under this announcement must be completed no later than September 30, 2008. The Service will award multiple CCS projects generally ranging between $1,000 and $30,000. The Service may use cooperative agreements, procurement contracts, service contracts, grant agreements, or CCS agreements as the award vehicle. The actual award instrument used depends entirely upon the type of proposal submitted and the nature of the project therein. The Service will award multiple federal assistance (Challenge Cost Share Agreements) and / or acquisition instruments (Challenge Cost Share Contracts) to multiple recipients. The nature of the specific project will be the determining factor in whether Challenge Cost Share Agreements or Challenge Cost Share Contracts are awarded. The Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977 is the defining factor in how a federal agency decides whether a project is "federal assistance" or "federal acquisition". The decision factors associated with the Act may be viewed at the following link http://elips.doi.gov/elips/release/3080.htm .

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH
for
Financial Advisors to USDOT Credit Programs:
Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA)
and
Title XI Loan Guarantee, Maritime Administration (MARAD)

November 16, 2007

Pursuant to 48 C.F.R. Part 10, the Government is conducting market research to:

?	Determine if sources exist that are capable of satisfying the Government?s requirements listed below,
?	Determine the capabilities of potential contractors, including an estimate of prices, 
?	Determine the size and status of potential sources, and
?	Determine the level of competition (i.e. 8(a), set-aside, dbe contract goal, or full and open)

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of the Department of Transportation (DOT), intends to establish multiple, 5-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for financial analysis expertise to assist DOT with respect to the credit assistance programs described herein. 

The FHWA seeks to award multiple financial advisory task order contracts to highly qualified firms with financial analysis expertise in the municipal bond, private activity bonds, corporate bonds, and private lender sectors and public-private infrastructure partnerships to assist DOT with applications for credit assistance under the DOT credit programs described herein.

Offerors may propose to provide financial advisory services for one or more of the programs.


I. BACKGROUND

The following Department of Transportation (DOT) programs will be soliciting Financial Advisors:

A.	Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA) Program administered by the TIFIA Joint Program Office. Pursuant to the TIFIA statute (23 U.S.C. 601-609), the Department of Transportation (DOT) is authorized to provide credit assistance to major surface transportation projects, including secured (direct) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to borrowers for major surface transportation projects, for up to 33% of eligible project costs.  Projects may include highway, transit, rail and intermodal facilities with reasonably anticipated eligible costs greater than $50 million.  Extensive information on the TIFIA Credit Program can be found on the Internet at http://tifia.fhwa.dot.gov.


B.	Maritime Guaranteed Loan (Title XI) Program administered by the Maritime Administration. The Title XI Program provides a full faith and credit guarantee by the U.S. Government of debt obligations issued by (1) U.S. or foreign ship owners for the purpose of financing or refinancing either U.S. flag vessels or eligible export vessels constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned in U.S. shipyards; and (2) U.S. shipyards for the purpose of financing advanced shipbuilding technology and modern shipbuilding technology (Technology) of a privately owned general shipyard facility located in the United States.  Additional information about the Title XI program may be found on the following website: www.marad.dot.gov/titleXI/. 

II. EXPERTISE REQUIRED

A.	TIFIA
The selected advisors would assist DOT in up to three phases of activity with respect to TIFIA loan transactions:

PHASE 1 (Project Evaluation):   Each TIFIA applicant is required to provide extensive narrative and financial information, including a working model of the project finance plan.  Specific tasks for the financial advisor include:

a)	Analyzing the plan of finance and the assumptions therein, as well as other financial background material submitted by the TIFIA applicant to identify project risks, including reasonableness of the revenue forecasts and the capability and capacity of the project sponsor to deliver the project on schedule and within budget.

b)	Assisting DOT in evaluating the creditworthiness of the proposal, including an assessment of the borrower?s ability to meet repayment obligations on its proposed TIFIA credit instrument, based on forecast revenues and expenditures and any other outstanding or proposed financing arrangement of the borrower.

	
PHASE 2 (Project Negotiation):   For those projects selected to receive assistance, the financial advisor would support the TIFIA negotiating team (including DOT staff, attorneys and outside counsel) in negotiating the financial terms of the credit agreement. Specific tasks for the financial advisor may include (but not limited to):

a)	Assist in the negotiation of a credit agreement with the borrower, including attendance at meetings in Washington, D.C. and participation in conference calls involving DOT, its legal and financial advisors, and the borrower, as necessary.  (The DOT anticipates that each credit agreement will involve several meetings in Washington among members of the financing team for the project.)

b)	Perform detailed financial calculations related to the overall financial structure of the transaction and the specific revenues pledged toward TIFIA repayments, such as coverage ratios, debt capacity, alternative repayment structures, sensitivity analysis, and financial tests.

c)	Provide such calculations in a timely fashion.  Provide supporting worksheets and maintain a computer model to conduct analyses. 

d)	Prepare debt service schedules for the TIFIA credit instrument, showing scheduled repayments and debt service coverage by pledged net revenues.

Both the evaluation and negotiation phases involve extensive financial analysis, including, but not limited to, the evaluation of proposed credit structures, calculation of debt service coverage ratios, development of alternative TIFIA debt repayment structures, review of feasibility studies and hedging arrangements, evaluation of revenue sharing arrangements, and provision of computer analysis and modeling support.

The financial advisor must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. on short notice. 
 
		PHASE 3 (Risk Assessment):  In addition to the negotiation tasks, the TIFIA Program Office may require a quantitative risk assessment on specific projects with greater levels of complexity or uncertainty in their financial forecast.  The tasks for each risk assessment will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

a)	Reviewing the project feasibility study, traffic and revenue study, and/or other related documents, as applicable, provided by the project sponsor to the TIFIA JPO and identify key variables.  The TIFIA JPO will provide when available the project?s plan of finance, the financial model, the feasibility report and/or traffic and revenue study , the draft TIFIA credit agreement, and the draft senior bond indenture or loan document, as applicable.

b)	Researching and analyzing regional economic forecasts to assess the reasonableness of key economic assumptions, quantities, values and demographic variables.

c)	Based on the analysis in the tasks above, developing a structure and logic model to depict the relationships of the underlying variables in the revenue forecasts

d)	Conducting an independent risk analysis of each key variable identified in the tasks above.

e)	Building a computer model that will allow the consultant to apply Monte Carlo Simulation, using the probability ranges for each key variable, to assess the impact on the forecast revenues.

f)	Documenting the findings in a final report that represents the independent risk analysis of revenue and financial forecasts, including an assessment of the likelihood that the project can achieve the financial ratios that TIFIA seeks to establish for the credit instrument.

g)	Prepare final credit evaluation report, documenting the results of analysis and assessment.

The financial advisor may propose alternative approaches or methodologies to conducting the required risk assessment, identifying tasks that supplement or substitute for those described.

Expertise in Each Phase Not Required

As noted, phases 2 and 3 are optional, depending upon the results of the credit evaluation and the complexity or uncertainty of the financial forecast.  In seeking advisors, therefore, the FHWA seeks firms (a) capable of performing each of the three phases, (b) capable of performing phases 1 and 2 only, or (3) capable of performing phase 3 only.  In practical terms, the FHWA expects that two financial advisory firms may support a project by performing different tasks (i.e., one firm would perform phases 1 and 2 and the other firm would perform phase number 3. 

B.	MARAD
The services to be provided by the contractor may include, but are not necessarily limited to, one or more of the following:

?	Evaluate the economic soundness of the project and creditworthiness of the applicant for credit assistance. This evaluation will include analyzing (1) the financial viability of the project, including the plan of finance [capitalization plan] and assumptions therein; (2) the financial condition of the borrower and other relevant parties, (3) the past performance and future ability to meet all repayment obligations, and (4) project risks, including reasonableness of the revenue and expense forecasts, and project schedule and costs.
?	Analyze historic financial performance of the borrower, including balance sheets, income statements, cash flows, and footnotes to audited financial statements, to determine strengths, weaknesses, and trends and generate projected financial statements.
?	Perform detailed financial calculations and establish ratios related to the overall financial structure of the transaction, previous financial experience, and industry comparisons. These calculations may include measures of profitability, liquidity, and financial strength, such as coverage ratios, debt capacity, alternative repayment structures, sensitivity analysis, stress testing and other financial tests. 
?	Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the borrower?s management.
?	Review and evaluate the feasibility studies for the project, including traffic and revenue studies.
?	Evaluate the proposed market for the project, including a review of applicable market studies/surveys, the borrower?s relationship with its major customers and the projected needs met by the project, and the project?s suitability for the intended market.
?	Review the proposed ownership structure of the transaction.
?	Prepare amortization schedules for the proposed credit facility that also show the debt service coverage.
?	At the direction of DOT, assist DOT credit agreement negotiations with the borrower, including performing financial analysis in support of the negotiations and assisting in negotiating the terms of the credit agreement and other documents to be executed by the credit applicant.
?	Attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, DC, as well as participate in telephone conference calls, as needed.
?	Submit a final report to DOT on the financial evaluation of the application, including recommendations (and suggested modifications, if applicable) on the proposed structure of the transaction, potential alternative structures for the financial plan and terms/conditions of the credit instrument.  Worksheets, including computer models, supporting the financial analysis must be maintained and available for DOT review.
?	Present final results of the financial evaluation in one or more meetings to DOT staff in Washington, DC.
?	Provide research and other special technical financial advisory services, as needed, to assist in carrying out DOT credit program requirements.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27104 for a project entitled ?Hispanic Aging Survey Feasibility Study?.  Design and implement a plan for recruiting Americans of Latino Ancestry into a health survey similar in content to the present Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study.  Participants will be recruited into the study; initial assessments will be collected of over all health, psycho-social indicators of psychological support and stress, health behaviors, and physical performance indicators.  Materials will be translated from English to Spanish (with back translations) for participants with limited English speaking abilities.  Data will be compared with baseline HANDLS results.
Health disparity is defined as a marked difference or inequality in a health measure, such as disability or mortality, between two or more population groups.  These population groups may be based on race or ethnicity, gender, education, or other criteria.  This project establishes the instruments necessary to assess the initial health status of a sample of Americans of Latino Ancestry.  The initial design of this study tests whether instruments similar to those used presently by the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study will apply to this group.  The goal of this work is examine the feasibility of extending the ethnic comparisons in HANDLS to Latinos, a minority group that is under-represented in Baltimore and excluded from the baseline HANDLS sampling design.  Initial measures will include a health screen for overall health, a health history summary, psycho-social indicators of psychological support and stress, health behaviors, and physical performance indicators.  These data will be collected in English or Spanish depending upon participants? preferred primary language.  Materials will be translated from English into Spanish, and back-translated to insure the accuracy of content and nuance.  All data collected will be preserved in electronic format.  Primary analyses will be performed in collaboration with HANDLS investigators, including comparisons with baseline HANDLS results.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because Wake Forest University School of Medicine is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Dr. Nguyen, Wake Forest, is an expert in cross-cultural bio-behavioral epidemiological studies that combine health status, functional status, and psycho-social inventories in multicultural settings in the United States and elsewhere.  She has published extensively on the influences of psychological measures on health outcomes in urban and rural minority samples.  Dr. Nguyen is one of a small handful of investigators with both a PhD and MPH who have interests in health disparities in minority groups.  A survey of the literature in this field and recommendations from investigators doing related research shows that there are no other sources for these services.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price technically acceptable offer.   The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Infantry Weapons Systems, Quantico, Virginia intends to conduct a limited competition for the second phase (production) of the Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR) project.  The goal of this project is to enhance the Automatic Rifleman?s maneuverability and displacement speed, while providing the ability to suppress or destroy those targets of most immediate concern to the rifle team.  This effort is a direct follow-on to phase one which was a development/demonstration effort conducted by MARCORSYSCOM and contracted through the National Small Arms Center (NSAC).  This phase allowed for the provision of prototypes for demonstration and proof of concept testing.  The intent of the initial prototype IAR effort was to reduce risk to the government and expand market research activities by allowing industry to demonstrate its capabilities to meet the government?s requirements for the Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR).  The results of the p!  rototype phase aided in refining the requirements for the IAR project.  The acquisition objective for the Marine Corps? production effort, which is subject to change, is 4,500 weapons.  This acquisition is being conducted through limited-competition using FAR procedures and a multi-year, firm-fixed price contract award.  The acquisition strategy, as stated in the Request for Project Proposals (RPP) W15QKN-06-R-0253 that was released through the NSAC in March 2006, limits phase two competition to the following vendors that successfully responded to the phase one RPP with a valid proposal:  Colt Manufacturing LLC, Fabrique National Herstal, General Dynamics ATP, Heckler & Koch, Knight?s Armament Company, and Leitner-Wise Rifle Company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 332994, Small Arms Manufacturing.  All contractors who provide goods/services to the DoD must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR).  Online Certifications and !  Representations at (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov, will also be required.   Failure to comply with ORCA registration may make a vendor offeror ineligible for award.

Any questions with regard to this requirement shall be addresses to the Purchasing Agent/Contract Specialist identified elsewhere on the solicitation/award document. All offers shall be evaluated for fair and reasonable price, technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, delivery schedule and adherence to the applicable clauses/provisions.  Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO NNSY Contractors? representatives must be United States citizens. Representatives are to provide the NNSY Security Office proof of U.S. citizenship (i.e. DHS I-9 FORM. ?Employee Eligibility Verification Form?). The I-9 is based on presentation of appropriate documentation that both verifies the employee?s eligibility for employment and denotes his citizenship status. Contractors can go to http://www.nnsy1.navy.mil/Secutity/docs/i-9.pdf to acquire the required form and completion guidance. NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee?s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee?s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person?s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery). Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029).

IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENVOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. 		******* End of Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ********

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with the Coordinating Center and Field Centers for the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Specifically, the contractors include the following: Coordinating Center- University of Alabama in Birmingham; Field Centers- University of Alabama in Birmingham, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and Kaiser Foundation Research Institute.  This effort will be for a five year follow-up contract for the CARDIA study.  Since the initiation of the CARDIA study in 1983 a total of 5,115 men and women from four communities across the U.S. have been recruited, examined, and followed for changes in and development of coronary heart disease risk factors and development of atherosclerosis in young adults.  The main goal of the study renewal is to identify risk factors for and assess racial differences in the development and progression of subclinical abnormalities.  The continued follow-up and examination of the CARDIA study will address the following five objectives:

1.	Assess the impact of timing and varying levels of risk factors throughout young adulthood on the development of subclinical ventricular, vascular, and pulmonary function abnormalities in mid-life
2.	Examine young adult antecedents and consequences of obesity and the longitudinal relationships and interactions among adiposity, insulin resistance, and inflammation
3.	Identify determinants and trajectories of subclinical disease development in women during menopause transition compared to men of similar age
4.	Further assess the basis for racial differences in subclinical disease development
5.	Provide a platform for in-depth ancillary studies in cardiovascular and other areas

These contracts will require an extensive comparison of the ongoing study, which will cover examination and follow-up of the cohort.  This will involve administering an eighth clinical examination of the surviving members of the original participants; continued performance of follow-up for morbidity and mortality; and performance of comprehensive laboratory and statistical activities, data analysis, and scientific publications efforts utilizing CARDIA data. The incumbent contractors have the unique capability to provide the required services to the NHLBI.  (See NOTE 22.)  

The statutory authority applicable to this solicitation is 41 USC 253(c) (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  A sources sought notice for any new technical requirements of the examination component will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website at a later date. 

This notice of intent will close forty-five days after posting. The estimated award date will be October 1, 2008. All responsible sources may submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants. Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a request for proposals.  Any interested parties in this or related subcontracting opportunities should contact either the Contracting Officer, Cheryl Jennings, cj19f@nih.gov, 301-435-0347 or  the Contracts Specialist, Jeffrey Williams, williamsja2@nhlbi.nih.gov, at 301-435-0338 for further details.

<DESC>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a FAR Part 13 basis and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Sandy Jackson, 8410 Clay Drive, Fort Washington, Maryland 20744 for 960 hours of support to the NINDS Division of Extramural Services (DER) in preparation of automated data products that expedite and facilitate the review of grant applications being reviewed at NANDS Council.  This automated support is provided to the DER/OD during three cycles per year.  The established business process between the DER/OD office and IRMB requires specific business knowledge of the NIH grants process and the eRA enterprise database schema to provide electronic books with required turn around times as short as 4 hours.  There are currently over 40 books produced for each round.  Each of the queries that support the creation of an electronic product requires maintenance, modification, testing and quality review for each round.  Each of the data products will be updated multiple times in the workflow up to their final presentation/use at the NANDS Council.  

Her knowledge of the NINDS Council business process and enterprise data sources allows her to perform the creation of electronic Council books with minimal input from the DER/OD.  She is able to initiate the modifications to the underlying queries and begin testing months before they are due.  This business knowledge reduces the burden of interaction that the DER/OD office must have to provide requirements during their busiest times of the year.  Sandra has intimate knowledge of the enterprise data repository (IMPAC II), the meaning and location of required attributes in the appropriate tables (Oracle database instances) and the structure of the data being processed (which tables to link and how).  This allows her to extract and format the data products to meet the very tight turnaround deadlines required by the Council process, while maintaining extremely high data quality.  She also has expert knowledge of the NINDS standard desktop, Oracle, MS Access and ODBC that enable her to perform her function.

Delivery and acceptance will be at the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.5 million. 

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

The sole source determination is based on: All diets must be manufactured using FIXED Formulations (All Harlan Teklad diets are manufactured using fixed formulas just like the NIH open formula diets? eliminates PMI diets since they use constant nutrition). Due to the sensitive nature of research, modifications or changes to diet formulas (even minor) can have serious impacts on research results and as well as breeding and therefore are not allowed. Rodent diets shall be completely vegetarian to eliminate the presence of nitrosamines (found in animal and fish by-products) which have been shown to be potential cancer causing compounds. Fish meal can contain mercury. Fish meal, meat and bone meal, animal fat, poultry meal and porcine meal cannot be contained in our rodent diets. (2018SX is completely vegetarian (as is the entire Global diet line) ? some of the NIH open formula diets and most of the PMI diets all contain some or all of the above listed ingredients) 
Rodent diets shall be formulated with no alfalfa meal and low or no soybean meal to minimize the presence of naturally occurring phytoestrogens (endogenous hormones found in soy and alfalfa that have been shown to affect a wide variety of research).       (2018SX has no alfalfa meal and low soy content). All bedding items must be screened semi-annually for contaminants (pesticides and heavy metals) and the results of these tests must be available upon request thereafter. All standard diet and bedding products must be stored in a climate controlled warehouse not to exceed 70F year round and humidity maintained at or below 55%.

<CONTACT>KATHRYN N. RILEY, Contract Specialist, Phone: 202-564-2790, E-Mail: riley.kathryn@epa.gov
<DESC>NAICS Code 541620.  Environmental Protection Agency intends to issue a sole source contract to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in support of the 2007-2008 EPA P3 Award Competition: A National Student Design Competition for Sustainability.  The Statement of Work and rationale for sole source purchase order follows. Statement of Work TASK DESCRIPTION: The contractor shall provide the qualified personnel and staff support necessary to evaluate up to 58 2007-2008 Phase I P3 projects, recommending Phase I P3 projects as P3 Award winners, and providing consolidated judges evaluations for each team. To provide this support, the contractor will perform the following sub tasks:  1.	Convene a panel of up to 25 judges who are leaders in the fields of engineering, water science, green chemistry, agriculture, green building design, waste issues, energy issues and/or sustainability to serve on the P3 Award evaluation panel, including providing on-site evaluations, on April 20 - 22, 2008 on the National Mall in Washington, DC.  The expertise of the selected judges should be based on the Phase I projects to be evaluated.   2.	In consultation with the EPA Project Officer prior to the Expo, revise and finalize the judging criteria and a process for scoring the projects.  The process needs to address evaluations of both the written reports reviewed prior to the Expo and review of the team presentations provided to the judges when they visit each team at the Expo.  The judges are responsible to evaluate the scientific quality and technical merit of the applications assigned to them and to provide the Agency with their critiques.  Each judge must provide an independent score reflecting his or her assessment of each application.  The highest score is excellent (E).  Scores range downward as very good (VG), good (G), fair (F), and poor (P).  The scores are defined as follows: Excellent:  A truly outstanding proposal with numerous exceptional attributes. Very Good:  A very strong proposal with many noteworthy merits. Good:  A solid proposal but not among the best, may have some deficiencies. Fair:  Not a strong proposal. Poor:  A proposal with serious deficiencies. In addition to scoring the proposals, the judges are requested to indicate particular strengths and weaknesses of each proposal in their individual critiques and in the summary evaluation.   3.	Deliver the Phase 1 P3 final reports and Phase 2 P3 proposals (a combined document for each team), to the judges three (3) weeks prior to the April 20 - 22, 2008 competition such that the panel will receive the reports no later than April 1, 2008.  These documents will be provided by the EPA Project Officer to the contractor. 4.	Assign judges to each proposal such that each written proposal is read by a minimum of 4 judges and each team is visited by a minimum of 4 judges at the Expo.  Written evaluations are provided by each judge for each proposal they review and each team they visit at the Expo. These written evaluations are then available at the judges? decision meeting and for consultation in preparing the summary evaluations for each team. 5.	On the days of the competition, manage the process for obtaining and collating written records of the onsite interviews with the student teams, discussions and decision meeting following the interviews, and the finalizing of the consolidated evaluation for each team.  A written summary evaluation will be prepared for each team incorporating comments from review of both the written project report and the team presentation at the Expo that summarizes the individual critiques and the discussion of the application that takes place at the panel meeting. 6.	On the final day of the competition, manage the judges meeting such that a numerical ranking of the teams is provided to the EPA Project Officer by 3:00 PM on April 22, 2007. ORD?s National Center for Environmental Research will use this ranking, along with information on available resources, balance of the research portfolio, overall program goals and directions and other criteria or considerations deemed appropriate, to determine which teams will receive the P3 Awards and which teams will receive Honorable Mentions.  Final funding decisions will be made by NCER. 7.	Pay travel costs for judges to attend the Expo and reimburse judges for their review time at a rate of $200/day (where appropriate).  (This is the rate that NCER?s Peer Review Division uses to reimburse Peer Reviewers who participate in our Peer Review panels.) Justification of Sole Source to the American Association for the Advancement of Science I.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires a Contractor that Possesses Unique Capabilities:   The nature of the acquisition requires a provider that has the demonstrated ability to identify and obtain participation from a wide range of technical and scientific experts in a wide range of disciplines to solicit their participation as judges for the P3 Program.  These unique capabilities are essential for contractor performance because without them we will not have the technical experts available to judge the 58 P3 projects.  We need this outside peer review to maintain the scientific credibility of the science being conducted under the P3 Program and the Director for the National Center of Environmental Research depends on the reviews provided by the outside experts to determine which of the teams will received the prestigious P3 Award and associated Phase II grant of up to $75,000. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the only institution which can offer such extensive experience in conducting independent peer review.  AAAS also offers access to more than 140,000 members representing all science and engineering disciplines.  It further has ready access to nearly 300 sustainability science researchers that take part in its Forum on Science and Innovation for Sustainable Development. II.  Why the AAAS is the Only Known Source to Satisfy the Government?s Requirements:   The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the only known source available to satisfy the Government?s requirements because of their ability to identify and reach scientific and technical experts in a wide range of scientific fields and their established Research Competitiveness Program. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the world?s largest nonprofit interdisciplinary organization for scientists and engineers.  Founded in 1848, AAAS serves some 262 affiliated societies and academies of science that in turn serve 10 million individuals.  The non-profit AAAS is open to all and fulfills its mission to ?advance science and serve society? through initiatives in science policy, international programs, and science education.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) and The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) have a requirement to develop medical therapies and diagnostics to counter radiological and nuclear threats.
Description 
Radiation injury can be caused by external or internal exposure, and the effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure. Internal exposure occurs when radionuclides are internalized by inhalation, ingestion, or through contaminated wounds and distributed to sensitive tissues.  The primary treatment to minimize internal exposure is the elimination of internal radionuclides through the administration of chelating, decorporating, or blocking agents.  There is a need for the continued development of decorporation agents.

The Offeror will provide the required services including the following: development of an information base and rodent and non-rodent animal models of internal radionuclide contamination, development of rodent and non-rodent screen and efficacy evaluation animal models, and GLP-compliant radionuclide exposure facilities.  The animal models that are to be developed are intended to support future GLP pivotal animal efficacy studies with an eventual goal of supporting licensure of decorporation agents or other treatments of radionuclide internal contamination.
The work to be performed under this contract will be initiated by the NIAID Contracts Office through a mechanism called work assignments.  The Government intends to establish contracts for two facilities to carry out the efforts described above.
Adherence to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) is a term and condition of all PHS grant or contract awards that includes use of live, invertebrate animals.  Both OLAW and AAALAC accreditations demonstrate compliance with PHS Policy.  The USDA regulates institutions performing research on warm-blooded species other than rodents and birds and must comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations.  Any research facility using radioactive materials in scientific research studies must comply with appropriate federal and state licensing requirements.

It is anticipated that two work assignment type contracts will be awarded for a five (5)-year period of performance beginning on or about September 30, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 6.35 FTEs. 

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about December 5, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  

This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis for a Biacore X100 Processing Unit along with the following components: Biacore X100 Consumable Startup Package, Biacore Computer System including CPu, monitor, and printer, Biacore X100 New User Web Based Training, Integrated and web-based methodology and evaluation support , Biacore X100 Warranty, Biacore X100 system installation with GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., 800 Centennial Avenue, P.O. Box 1327, Piscataway, NJ 08855-1327. 

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-(b)(1) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The following salient characteristics apply to the Biacore X100 Processing Unit, components, and technology: 

-	The system must allow label-free protein interaction analysis based on surface plasmon resonance.

-	The system must support the analysis of antibody/antigen and other protein/protein interactions in a variety of assay types to determine binding specificity (including epitope mapping), binding affinity, and binding kinetics without a need for large amounts of purified protein. 

-	The system must be able to detect association rate constants over a range of 10^3-10^7 M^-1 s^-1 and dissociation rate constants over a range of 5x10^-6 -0.5 s^-1.

-	The system must be automated to accept up to 15 individual sample tubes per run, allowing up to 24 hours of unattended sample analysis.

-	The system software must be user friendly, based on a Windows XP operating system, and networked to a 24/7 help center to address issues at any time of the day or night.

-	The system must allow a flow rate range from 1-100 uL/min.

-	The system must have a typical detection limit of 0.1 nM for >10 kDa analytes and 1 nM for <10 kDa analytes.

-	The system must be able to accommodate sensor chip surfaces that facilitate protein immobilization via amino, carboxyl, and thiol groups.  Pre-coated sensor chip surfaces compatible with the system that allow immobilization of biotinylated analytes as well as analytes with His tags must be commercially available.



JUSTIFICATION:

1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-(b)(1) and 13.501(a)(1)

(b)    Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

(2) 	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

For more than 10 years, Dr. Rader has applied plasmon surface resonance for the kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of antibody/antigen interactions.  Biacore instruments were the first to utilize surface plasmon resonance and clearly have remained the standard in the field with over 5,000 peer reviewed scientific publications.  No other technique provides such comprehensive information in real-time and from one system.  The purchase of a Biacore X100 instrument allows Dr. Rader to build on his knowledge and pass it on to his students.  In addition, the Biacore X100 instrument has many advantages over any other instrument or technology offered today.  Of particular importance to the Antibody Technology Section are unique features not found in any other commercially available instruments, including the detection of a very broad range of kinetic constants, sample capacity, assay flexibility, new user-friendly software, and 24/7 online help center.  In addition, the Biacore X100 instrument has ten times higher sensitivity than any other available label-free technologies on the market

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, the Operations and Maintenance Contractor for the NCI Frederick Cancer Research Facility is soliciting for the services described herein on behalf of the NCI. The NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTC) initiative was established with the goal of creating technologies, data, reagents and reference materials, analysis systems and infrastructure as a basis for advancing discovery research and clinical applications.  More information about the initiative can be found at http://proteomics.cancer.gov.  As part of the CPTC, a series of renewable and highly characterized affinity binding reagents will be generated and made available to the research community.  Detailed standard operating procedures (SOP?s) will be made available along with characterization data through a web portal.  This will ensure that experiments can be both repeated and compared among researchers.
 

The specific objective of this scope of work is to generate antibodies from antigens already generated under the CPTC. There are forty-two antigens that will be used in the generation and screening for new monoclonal antibodies. 
 

Once a set of antibodies are generated and screened by the contractor for each antigen, the antibodies will be sent to SAIC-F and undergo further screening and characterization including but not limited to Western Blot, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), immuno capture and mass spectrometry, and immuno histochemistry (IHC).  The data from all phases of the characterization, i.e. from contractor and other entities selected by NCI will be made public through the associated web portal.  The final antibodies and associated hybridoma cells will be made available to the scientific community through a distributor or repository selected by the NCI.  


The RFP is intended to solicit responses from parties interested in providing the antibodies to the NCI CPTC.  Multiple contracts may be issued. Full RFP to be posted by end of day 11/19/07.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NAVFAC Southwest will be hosting an Industry Forum to focus on the acquisition of SOLAR POWER on Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake. 

The intent of the Forum is to continue formulation of the Navy's strategy to develop renewable resources to substantially meet the electricity requirements at NAWS China Lake. The Navy previously collected market research information related to photovoltaic system development through a Request for Information (RFI) process during May 2007. This Forum is the next step towards the Navy intent to develop a renewable resource on Navy land at NAWS China Lake. The Forum will allow industry to receive input on the utilities requirements at NAWS China Lake as well as visit potential site(s) where renewable resources may be developed. The Forum will also serve to inform industry of the Department of the Navy's acquisition process, contractual and legal parameters, business and program goals, and the Navy's strategic and economic vision for Renewable Energy.

The goal of the Forum is to solicit feedback from industry, government, and subject matter experts so that the Navy can formulate a specific strategy for Renewable Energy at NAWS China Lake.

Discussion topics will include the present state of utilities acquisition at NAWS China Lake, a summary of the annual load requirements, and the Navy's concept for developing renewable energy resources. 

The Forum presents an opportunity for industry participants to grasp an understanding of the Navy's requirements and potential renewable energy development opportunity and partnering potential at NAWS China Lake.

Please visit our NAVFAC website, located at 
https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/navfacsw   (go to Quick Links)

Please register at this website for further information and Forum attendance.

The Forum is scheduled for 05 December, 2007 (0830-1630) at NAWS China Lake, which is located next to Ridgecrest, CA. The exact location on NAWS China Lake and access procedures will be published on the website listed above.

For questions regarding the Forum please contact Ms. Rea Carlos at (619) 532-1103, or email: rea.carlos@navy.mil, or Mr. Calvin Kawamura at (619) 532-1813 or email: calvin.kawamura@navy.mil.

The scope of the contract includes fabrication, testing, and delivery of high density printed circuit boards (PCBs). Features of the high density PCB's include:  (1) High layer count boards, (2) Pin count greater than 500 pins per square inch, (3) Blind and buried vias, (4) Fine pitch Ball Grid Arrays (BGA) (0.5 mm) High pin count BGA (1,764 pins), (5) Differential and controlled impedance,  (6) Matched length traces, and (7) Flex Circuits: rigid multilayer and rigid-flex multilayer.  The fabrication of the PCBs includes populating the circuit boards with electronic components.  The electronic components may be government furnished material (GFM) to the contractor or provided by the contractor for use in population.  The electronic components consist of thru-hole, surface mount, BGA, leadless parts, and unique packaging.   The contractor shall provide required testing and reporting of the fabricated PCBs and the component population.  The contractor shall perform full design rule check (DRC) and design for manufacturing (DFM) on Gerber files provided by the government.  The contractor shall be an ISO 9001 registered company, and meet the manufacturing procedures that enable the PCBs to meet the rigorous environmental requirements specified in the statement of work.  The contractor shall work closely with NAVAIR WD design engineers and notify them of errors and/or anomalies in the Gerber files.  The contractor shall also recommend changes to the Gerber files that fix the errors, anomalies, and/or increases the yield of the PCBs.  All changes will be approved by NAVAIR WD engineers before fabrication of the PCBs begins.   The contractor will evaluate the impedance of the designed traces, and alert NAVAIR WD if there is difference from the specified impedance.  The contractor will test the impedance of the specified traces post fabrication and in circuit.  The contractor shall comply with the Mil-P-55110 and Mil-P-50884 specification listed in the SOW.  The contractor shall use a process to inspect the circuitry and vias to ensure finished PCB electrical conformity to the Gerber file. The contractor shall use processes that ensure that there is uniformity across PCB panels for both prototype and production PCBs, and provide one or more test coupons on every manufacturing panel.   The test coupons shall be thermally stressed, micro-sectioned, impedance tested, and examined for PCB conformity to the Gerber file. Each board delivered shall be accompanied with documentation of both the electrical and mechanical sufficiency of the boards.  To maintain the schedule requirements for this project, the manufacturer must be located within 250 miles of China Lake, CA to allow NAVAIR WD engineers to inspect the PCBs, both without and without electronic components, at the manufacturer's facility.   The minimum number of PCBs to be procured is 2 with a unit issue of "each" per ID/IQ contract.  For any orders in excess of the minimum quantity, each ID/IQ contractor will be given a fair opportunity to be considered.  Delivery of all line items will be FOB Destination with the destination and time defined within each delivery order.

<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATION  # 5172 -  Urban Design and Master Planning

The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to subcontract for Professional Planning services for the LBNL Master Plan. 

This is not a request for quotation. It is an announcement for subcontracting opportunities with the University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Interested firms are encouraged to submit qualifications as indicated below.  This is not a small business set-aside procurement.  

The LBNL Master Plan will be developed in three phases: Phase 1 ? Vision Presentation; Phase 2 - Master Plan with Design Guidelines/Standards; and Phase 3 ? Consulting for review of on-going projects.

Phase 1 - will involve working with Senior Lab Managers to develop an image, vision statement for the future physical development of the LBNL site.  The work must fit within the parameters of the LBNL?s 2006 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) with accompanying Environmental Impact Report (EIR).  (The LRDP and EIR have been recently approved by the UC Regents and provide a land use plan, growth projections, and discussion of environmental impacts.)  The vision statement must then be translated into a Vision Presentation that graphically depicts the future look, feel and sustainability of the Berkeley Lab and include an illustrative site plan, appropriate illustrative sections, sketches and ?script? to be presented by LBNL staff to UC Regents in March 2008.  Some work has been done in this area, but not vetted by Lab management.

Phase 2 - will involve a master plan effort that includes everything physical on the LBNL site (from new building cohesiveness, exterior materials, colors, roofs, landscaping/ vegetation, walkways, stairways, handrails, exterior furniture, garbage cans, bus stop kiosks, etc.).  The products will include landscape master plan, infrastructure master plan, environmental graphics master plan, phasing plan, visual simulations, and design guidelines/standards that Lab planners can reference in siting and designing any physical feature on the LBNL site.  Other products may include parking plans and scenarios, and recommendations for a new building numbering system.  The timeframe for completion is approximately one year from subcontract award. Phase 1 and 2 work scopes will have overlapping schedules.

Phase 3 - will be on-going consultation and review of future projects to ensure consistency and interpretation of the Master Plan.  

The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab is one of ten national DOE laboratories performing research and development of national and global importance. The 202-acre site contains 1.8 million gross square feet of scientific, administrative, and operations space with approximately 100 permanent buildings and 50 temporary trailers on the main site. LBNL?s current adjusted daily population of 4,500 is expected to grow to 5,400 by 2025. Its unique research facilities conduct large-scale, interdisciplinary programs in the life, environmental, physical, materials, nanotechnology, computing, and general sciences. These programs are increasingly being undertaken in partnership with both universities and private industry. The Master Plan is intended to guide LBNL in continuing to fulfill its pre-eminent role in the future world of science and technology.

Department of Interior (DOI), in partnership with the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Training Academy


Background:
FEDSIM?s client, the Department of Interior (DOI), in partnership with the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Training Academy has a requirement to provide Land Mobile Radio (LMR) support to their user communities.  LMR equipment can include base stations, mobiles, handhelds, portables, consoles, repeaters, trunking equipment, and microwave equipment.  To that end, GSA FEDSIM is conducting a market survey to determine interest, technical and managerial capability of the LMR community to satisfy the requirements for LMR equipment. 

Purpose

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather industry input and to survey the LMR community in order to collect data, comments, and other information on LMR issues relevant to the attached SOW.  This Request for Information (RFI) is to also to gather information to assist the FEDSIM in formulating its requirements and determine if there are vendors who are able to meet the requirements.

The Government is considering the viability of two alternative approaches for the procurement of equipment and associated PMO/system integration functions, in support of the LMR program.  In no order of preference, these approaches are:

One approach is awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), under the GSA Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, for a total period of 5 years for the LMR equipment and conduct a second acquisition off GSA Connections, Lot 3, for the LMR support services associated with the LMR equipment mentioned in this RFI.  These services will include establishing a Project Management Office with systems integration effort (including development of a web portal and web portal management).  

A second acquisition strategy approach would involve a single task order award, using a GSA GWAC (Millennia, Alliant- depending on availability status, Connections, etc.), for the purpose of procuring managed services, inclusive of equipment procurement, associated services, PMO/web portal, and system integration tasking.   

The FEDSIM is open to alternative ideas. Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help the FEDSIM better define its requirements and obtain a contract solution that meets its needs.  Responses to the RFI will assist GSA FEDSIM in determining an appropriate course of action to address LMR issues.

Potential Conflict of Interest Information
If GSA FEDSIM proceeds with the GSA Schedules BPA/Connections Acquisition strategy, the LMR services will include establishing a Project Management Office which the BPA awardees must coordinate financial and contractual reporting.  As such, a contractor would not be able to propose under the BPA and the Connections support services task order.  

In order to avoid and/or appropriately mitigate a conflict of interest, the FAR clause will be in the solicitation.

Contractor Information
Contractors are being invited and encouraged to review this RFI and the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) and provide any comments, concerns, and/or questions regarding this requirement no later than 3:00 pm on December 4, 2007.

Background - 

The Naval Air systems Command, Department of the Navy, and all Department of Defense agencies are considering the use of a hand-held rechargeable fire extinguisher containing 2.5 pounds of halocarbon HFC-236fa with a mounting bracket. NAVAIR is considering replacing the current CO2 FE bottles with a agent called Halocarbon (HFC). HFC-236 is an effective replacement for providing rapid extinguishment of flames through a combination of physical and chemical mechanisms. In an effort to increase our fire fighting and environmental safety capabilities, the NAVAIR research team have suggested that our review could be improved by focusing less on experimental  details and more on key ideas and the scientific significance of this proposed project. To ensure that the DoD review process identifies the most promising scientific and technical projects, we are evaluating our research and focusing it on ideas of significance. A committee has been formed at NAVAIR to gather additional information from the external community and explore possible options. We would like your professional opinion, as possible applicant and/or reviewer, of this potential change. Information pertaining to this product  will help NAVAIRSYSCOMM, DoN, and DoD determine whether to incorporate the HFC-236fa as an appropriate fire fighting safety measure.

<SUBJECT>A -- Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenic Episode (RAISE)
<SOLNBR>NIMH-08-DS-00009
<RESPDATE>121007

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all sources capable of responding to a potential new solicitation entitled "Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenic Episode (RAISE)".  The goal of this initiative will be to improve prognosis and long-term outcome for people suffering from schizophrenia.  

Despite the development and widespread use of antipsychotic drugs, schizophrenia still devastates the lives of young adults and their families.  Chronic deterioration and a lifetime of disability remain the norm.  The bitter lesson from a half-century of treatment research has been that skills and abilities lost to chronic schizophrenia are rarely, if ever, regained.  However, unlike chronically ill patients, people experiencing a first psychotic episode usually respond well to treatment, and many are able to completely recover.  Treatment responsiveness changes over time, but in current practice, management of the first year of illness differs little from management of the twentieth year.  The unanswered question is whether aggressive, integrated, and sustained pharmacological, psychosocial, and rehabilitative intervention after an initial schizophrenic episode can forestall chronic disability.

While the question is straightforward, finding an answer will not be simple.  A large scale randomized clinical trial (RCT), costing many tens of millions of dollars will be required to definitively answer this question.  Before undertaking such a large commitment, many unknowns need to be addressed, including the feasibility of recruiting and retaining newly diagnosed patients in a longitudinal trial; the treatment model, particularly which mix of pharmacological, psychological, and rehabilitative interventions has the best chance of both preventing deterioration and maintaining subject participation; the nature of the control intervention; and at least some pilot evidence that the intervention will be successful.  

The purpose of RAISE is to 
1.	Determine the feasibility of an RCT testing whether chronic loss of function can be prevented after an initial episode of psychosis (not substance induced, affective disorder related, or related to a neurological or medical disorders)
2.	Develop an intervention or service delivery system incorporating an adaptive model for individualized treatment to promote long term recovery after an initial psychotic episode.  This will require input and on-going involvement from investigators studying pharmacological, psychosocial, and rehabilitative interventions in schizophrenia, particularly the first episode.  This will also require substantive input and on-going involvement from clinicians, policy makers, advocates, and consumers familiar with consumer and family-driven mental health systems (as envisioned by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health)
3.	Define and develop a "treatment as usual" comparator (or service delivery system)
4.	Test and refine the intervention and comparator, obtaining pilot data in a cohort of between 200 - 500 subjects recruited and followed over the course of the project from multiple sites representative of first episode patients in the community.
5.	Disseminate results and promote awareness and interest in early intervention to prevent chronic deterioration in schizophrenia.  
6.	Stimulate research on illness course, as well as mediators and moderators of outcome in schizophrenia
7.	If the pilot results from RAISE are promising, identify and cultivate potential funding sources outside of NIMH) that could fund (or co-fund) a large scale, definitive RCT

While a single source will be selected, NIMH anticipates that collaboration between multiple investigators and institutions will be required.  The specific experience and capabilities necessary to perform this work include (but are not limited to):
1)	Experience in performing randomized clinical trials in schizophrenia, particularly in first episode patients;
2)	Ability to recruit significant numbers of subjects experiencing an initial psychotic episode from multiple representative community sites, and ability to retain and follow up subjects in an ongoing clinical trial 
3)	Experience with model mental health delivery systems, and familiarity with consumer and family driven, recovery focused systems (as envisioned by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health)
4)	The capability to develop a new adaptive treatment model involving pharmacological, psychosocial, and rehabilitative interventions to promote long term recovery and forestall loss of function in people in a first psychotic episode;
5)	The capability to develop appropriate outcome measures and control conditions;  
6)	The ability to collect, analyze, and report multi-site pilot data from subjects with schizophrenia that could inform the design of a successor RCT;  
7)	Experience collaborating with multiple experts and stakeholders (investigators, clinicians, policy makers, advocates, and consumers) in schizophrenia research

Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the above work.

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the full complement of services required, including volunteers, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities in which to study the biology of influenza viruses in humans, to examine the host's immune response to these viruses, and to test and evaluate new candidate vaccines for safety, genetic stability, immunogenicity, transmissibility and protective efficacy in humans. Studies will also include the safe administration of wild-type virus to healthy adult volunteers in order to assess pathogenicity, virulence and their suitability for use as a challenge virus in efficacy studies. These wild-type viruses will be used to challenge vaccinated adult volunteers in order to assess the extent of immunity induced by candidate vaccines.


Studies will include both adult and pediatric subjects since influenza viruses cause severe respiratory disease in people of all ages. In summary, the requirement is to provide the necessary populations to study the biology and immunology of a variety of influenza viruses and serve as a testing center for the development of new vaccines effective against these agents.


All small businesses including veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HBCU, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns should respond with a capability statement by December 7, 2007, 11:00am Eastern Time. Teaming arrangements are encouraged. (No large businesses should respond to this announcement.) Capability statements must reference similar work that has been performed by the contractor and the dollar value of that work. Respondents should specifically address their capability to screen and recruit adult volunteers, as well as the ability to administer clinical trials. This is a market survey, not a request for proposals. All questions must be directed, in writing, to Alexander Kramer at kramera@niaid.nih.gov

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to determine potential sources capable of performing studies to address programmatic and technical aspects related to the US Global Hawk Block 40 and the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS). 

AGS will be a NATO-owned and operated system that will provide continuous, unrestricted, unfiltered Wide Area surveillance information from a stand-off position in all weather conditions for use at the political, strategic, operational and tactical level of decision-making in NATO and in the NATO nations. 
The acquisition of the NATO AGS system will be comprised of two phases, the Design, Development and Demonstration (D3) and the Production/O&S phase.

In 2004 NATO made a down-select to a mixed fleet solution proposed by a joint venture including Northrop Grumman and based on a manned Airbus aircraft and the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk (GH) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  The manned aircraft was deleted from the program in mid-2007 because of affordability issues and NATO is now pursuing an AGS solution based on the Northrop Grumman-produced Global Hawk with the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor.  

The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify potential highly competitive firms for a set of risk reduction activities.  The selected contractor will provide necessary products and information that will: define the NATO AGS Core Capability resulting from a UAV only based approach, present interdependency between ongoing related USAF program and NATO potential reuse technology candidates, draft the interoperability approach, and assist in drafting  the system Concept of Operations.  Additionally, the selected contractor shall provide acquisition strategies to identify and mitigate any impacts to the USAF RQ-4 Block 40 program and lower the risk of the NATO AGS program execution. 

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought request.  The Government requests interested offerors submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the key features discussed above and the screening criteria below. Responses should include examples of systems successfully developed.  The Government expects that interested sources should meet the following criteria:

 (1) Possess or have the ability to obtain a U.S. Secret clearance as well as NATO Secret access.

(2)  Have demonstrated experience in studies and analysis of complex airborne ground surveillance systems.   

(3) Have previous experience in executing studies and risk reduction efforts on behalf of NATO and the US Government.  

(4) Have demonstrated experience with NATO ISR concepts and initiatives. 

(5) Have familiarity with NATO military requirements for airborne ground surveillance.

(6) Indicate your business size (Large or Small) as it applies to the NAICS Code 541990)

Interested parties who respond with their intention to be a potential offeror will be screened against the above criteria to identify highly competitive firms.  Responses must be submitted via CD ROM with two hard copies to the following address:  

Electronics Systems Center
(ATTN:  Ms Kimberlene Butler)
75 Vandenberg Drive, Bldg 1630
Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2119

Responses must be submitted in a Microsoft Word 2007 or higher format no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, 7 Dec 2008, and should not exceed 3, one-sided, 8.5 X 11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point.

<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC), herein known as the Contractor, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide the services described below to prequalified bidders only.  

To be deemed prequalified to bid on the RFP, potential bidders must respond affirmatively to the ??Prequalification Criteria?? section, questions one (1) and two (2) addressing specific areas of expertise.  

Summary Scope of Work:

The scope of work (SOW) for this Subcontract will include the design, material procurement, fabrication, testing, and shipment of a prototype dual purpose canister (DPC) cutting machine, as well as DPC adapter plate types 1, 2, and 3.  The DPC cutting machine is a non-Important to Safety (non-ITS) system that will be used to cut open any of the various DPCs that will be received at Yucca Mountain (YMP) to allow for the removal of the DPC lid and shield plug. The ultimate purpose of this equipment is to cut open DPCs containing spent nuclear fuel in order to access the fuel and transfer it into a standard type of canister for permanent emplacement in an underground storage repository.  The prototype DPC cutting machine will be used to demonstrate this capability using surrogate materials. 

Subcontractor will be provided with a design concept for the prototype DPC cutting machine and shall propose design improvements, including alternate approaches and component selection.  Design improvements shall result in benefits associated with:  safety, quality, reliability, seismic design, analysis and qualification, fabrication and construction, installation, testing, maintenance and repair, performance, costs, or schedule. 

There are ten possible types of DPCs that will need to be cut open with the following dimensions: 

DPC outside diameter:			66 to 70.64 inches
DPC shell thickness:				0.5 to 0.625 inches
DPC length:					122.5 to 191.75 inches
Outer top cover plate thickness:		1.25 to 3 inches
Inner top cover plate thickness:		0.75 to 1 inch
Top shield plug thickness:			3.9 to 10 inches
Basket assembly length:			112.8 to 179.3 inches


A typical example of a DPC is shown below:

The following list describes the main criteria that must be met for DPC cutting:  

??	The cutting system must be remotely operated as much as possible.
??	The amount of debris generated during the cutting operation must be minimized using a vacuum collection system.
??	The spent nuclear fuel must not be damaged during the cutting operation.

Scope of work also includes:
??	a detailed engineered design of special tools, lifting beams, or fixtures required for assembly, installation, operation, maintenance, testing and disassembly of the prototype DPC cutting machine and the adapter plates.
??	the fabrication of the prototype DPC cutting Machine, DPC adapter plate types 1, 2, and 3, and any special tools, lifting beams or fixtures required to support prototype testing in order to qualify the design and to identify requirements for the final equipment design.
??	a prototype test as part of a verification plan to demonstrate that the requirements of the prototype DPC cutting machine and DPC adapter plates are met.

Subcontractor will be required to provide drawings and other technical submittals that contain sufficient information to fabricate, test, operate and maintain the designed items.

Subcontractor will be required to provide surrogate materials representative of DPCs that will be received by the YMP (to support prototype testing by Subcontractor).

A final report will be required to document how the prototype DPC cutting machine and DPC adapter plates meet the design requirements.

Location of the Work:

Work shall be performed at Subcontractor??s or subtier supplier??s facilities, unless otherwise directed by the Contractor.  All fabrication shall be performed within the United States.

Period of Performance:

The estimated RFP issuance date is approximately December 2007.  The anticipated planned date for award of the Subcontract is February 2008. The estimated period of performance is to commence work in February 2008, with an expected duration not to exceed twelve (12) months.

<SUBJECT>66 -- AKTA FPLC System
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corporation, 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, New Jersey 08855-1327.  

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2008-024-DDC. 

The item to be purchase is: Custom AKTA FPLC without FRAC, catalog #18190026 quantity one (1) each, to include the Bio Insite SW, Warranty/Contract, catalog #28407364, for a period of one (1) year.  Installation and training must be provided by the vendor, at no additional cost, inside delivery which includes the installation of equipment, of equipment, removal of ALL debris.

The Government?s estimated expected delivery date is sixty calendar days after receipt of the purchase order.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the purchase is required to perform protein purification in the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics (LMB).  Due to the increase in the lab personnel and the requirement to purify proteins, a new FPLC system is needed.  The AKTA FPLC system will allow protein purification from a variety of hosts while permitting a vast number of different purification modalities, required to purify a wide range of proteins.  This FPLC system will complement other AKTA FPLC systems currently in use in the LMB.  By purchasing a similar system, existing protocols and columns can be used on th new system and, more generally, identical protein purification can be run on all of the AKTA systems in the LMB.
Due to compatibility it is to the government?s best interest to purchase the AKTA FPLC system from GE Healthcare Bio-Science.


Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, Size Standard is 500 employees. The small business set-aside does not apply. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures, and exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<SUBJECT>14 -- Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Request for Information for Follow-On Effort
<DESC>Description:  The Ground-Based Missile Defense (GMD) Program is conducting market research to determine interest and capability in the follow-on efforts to the current program. This is a market research announcement for informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Information submitted will be considered an exchange of capabilities. Any proprietary information provided should be properly marked. No solicitation will be issued at this time. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the government. The government is in no way bound by this information if a solicitation is issued.
 

The Ground Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Segment of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) under the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is developing a follow-on contract strategy for the continuation of spiral development, test, fielding, sustainment of the GMD system, and integration of the GMD system with the BMDS.  The GMD program's evaluation of acquisition strategy alternatives will be done in multiple stages with this first Request for Information (RFI) concentrating on acquisition risk areas where the government's availability, suitability and/or the government's rights in technical data/computer software may be limited.  While this RFI is intended more towards eliciting the views of existing BMDS contractors/subcontractors, all interested parties are encouraged to reply.  Future RFIs will broaden the scope of information requested and will include more detailed work package scope descriptions with intent of gauging interest and capability across the entire commercial market/industry.

 
The intent of this RFI will be to gauge what, if any, mitigation strategies are available in support of the identified areas and to gather enough information to determine what, if any, risks, such as schedule delays, may result by breaking out these activities into competitive acquisitions.  The briefings and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm's or team's ability to perform; however, these will be utilized in the final determination of acquisition alternatives evaluated by the government.
  

The Government's current acquisition alternatives include segregating the program into two distinct contracts with periods of performance starting in January 2009: (1) Continued Spiral Development, System Evolution, and Integration within GMD and into the BMDS; and (2) Performance Based Logistics (PBL) in support of the fielded GMD system.  All RFI responses should assume these activities are performed as separate contract vehicles.  The government may consider other acquisition alternatives and suggestions offered by industry.  


If your response to this RFI addresses a subset of the requirements versus all areas in total, you should also address how your approach would avoid seams/gaps in the program and resultant contracts such that a totally integrated GMD system is ensured.

Introduction: Lack of technical data/software, technical data/software rights limitations and/or lack of access to existing GMD facilities/services may limit the Government's ability to competitively award follow-on work or transition support to the services in certain areas of development, integration, and/or operations and sustainment.  Therefore, the Government requests that capability presentations specifically address the interested business firm or team's ability to transition technical activities and capabilities in the following areas.  A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) schedule estimate highlighting initial capability delivery/availability is requested in each area that capabilities are proposed. 


1.  System Test Capability:   System test lab resources are scarce, high demand assets that are fundamental to the successful development, integration, verification, and assessment of present and future GMD capability.  The Government is requesting information from interested parties on their ability to provide lab test facilities and system level test services required to support system level development, integration, verification and assessment of the GMD System.  Proposed test lab facilities should, at a minimum, have similar capabilities to the Prime Consolidated Integration Laboratory (PCIL) and Integrated System Test Capability (ISTC) that are currently utilized to conduct system test activities.  Capabilities required include but are not limited to:


  High fidelity, real-time system simulation of GMD fielded operational capabilities.

  Multi-point, distributed test environment to include connectivity to operational sites, such as: UEWR at Beale; GCN; IDT, Relocatable IDT or Virtual IDT at Vandenberg, Shemya and Ft. Greely; ET at Vandenberg, Beale, Ft. Greely, JNIC; GBI CLE; CLE Lab; CDU at Shemya; GMD GFC/C at Ft. Greely, JNIC and CMOC; External System Interface Main Processor (ESI-MP) at Ft. Greely and JNIC; ESI Data Bridge (ESI-DB) at SPAWAR, JNIC and Fr. Greely; GFC/C SBIRS Test Node (STN) at Boulder; C2BMC, Boulder CO.

  High fidelity simulation of current and future Ballistic Missile threats

  High fidelity simulation of current and future physical and environmental conditions

  Component representations of COBRA DANE Upgrade (CDU); Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR); Sea Based XBR Radar (SBX); Orbital Science Boost Vehicle (OBV); and Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV)

  External component drivers


Interested parties should recommend mitigation strategies or provide strategies and information on their ability to utilize existing assets or procure, develop, construct and/or maintain all of the necessary software, hardware and operational resources needed for the proposed lab test facilities and system level test services. The government's technical library will be limited and complete source data may not be available, however, assume all existing hardware is owned by the government in the current Prime Contractor's facility.
 

2.  Simulated Combat Environment Capability:  The Government is requesting information from interested parties on their ability to provide a simulated combat environment to support system level integration, verification, and assessment of the GMD System, as well as, the growth of the proposed capability to support a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment (i.e. CHETS/MDSE).  The proposed simulated combat environment should have similar functionality to the Embedded Test (ET) capability that is currently utilized on the GMD Program.  Capabilities required include but are not limited to:


  Creation of test scenarios

  Injection of truth data for test scenarios

  Definition of test environments

  Control of test events in the system test labs and in the field

  Post-mission playback


Interested parties should recommend mitigation strategies or provide information on their ability to utilize existing assets or procure, develop, construct and/or maintain all of the necessary software, hardware and operational resources needed for the proposed simulated combat environment capability. You should assume the current ET capability (Software and related documentation) is proprietary to the existing contractor and can not be provided by the government to other firms.

 
3.  Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) Integration Facility Capability:  Integration facilities are required to successfully deliver GBI(s) to support the GMD flight test program, as well as CONUS/OCONUS missile field emplacements.  Existing integration facilities (i.e. Interceptor Integration Facility (IIF)) will be used at full capacity to meet current contractual GBI delivery commitments.  The Government is requesting information from interested parties on their ability to provide facilities and services required to integrate GBI(s), if the IIF is not available.  Proposed facilities and services should support both delivery of GBI(s) required for GMD flight tests and CONUS/OCONUS missile field emplacements, as well as, refurbishment/upgrade of current GBI inventory at a through put rate of one GBI/fiscal quarter.  Interested parties must provide information on their ability to utilize existing assets or procure, develop, construct and/or maintain all of the necessary software, hardware and operational resources needed for a GBI integration facility.

 
4.  GBI Development and Integration Lab Capability:  Demand for GBI development and integration lab capabilities (i.e. GBI Development and Integration Laboratory (GDIL)) may impact GBI delivery milestones.  The Government is requesting information from interested parties on their ability to provide facilities and services required to develop GBI future capabilities and integrate them with the broader GMD system.  The proposed GBI integration facilities and services should, at a minimum, have similar functionality to the GDIL that is currently utilized on the GMD Program.  Interested parties must provide information on their ability to utilize existing assets or procure, develop, construct and/or maintain all of the necessary software, hardware and operational resources needed for a GBI development and integration lab.  You should assume the current GDIL capability (Software and related documentation) is proprietary to the existing contractor and can not be provided by the government to other firms.


5.  External Interface Capability:  The Government is requesting information from interested parties on their ability to provide an external interface capability for the GMD system that provides bi-directional communications and interfaces between the GMD Fire Control and Communications (GFC/C) network and external systems/sensors.  The proposed external interface capability should have similar functionality to the External Systems and Interfaces (ESI) capability that is currently utilized on the GMD Program.  Capabilities required include but are not limited to:


  Management of multiple sensor interfaces to include Aegis and AN/TPY-2

  Interoperability with upper echelon C2BMC system

  Provide a safeguard for GFC/C from non-standard interfaces

  Provide a mechanism for technology insertion that minimizes impact to GFC/C


Interested parties must provide information on their ability to utilize existing assets or procure, develop, construct and/or maintain all of the necessary software, hardware and operational resources needed for an external interface capability.  You should assume the current GFC/C capability (Software and related documentation) is proprietary to the existing contractor and can not be provided by the government to other firms.


6.  Sustainment and Upgrade of CONUS/OCONUS Operational Hardware and Software:  The Government is requesting information from interested parties on their ability to sustain and upgrade operational hardware and software for the GMD system.  Interested parties should identify mitigation strategies for the following:


  Maintain and repair weapon system components and facilities given the lack of complete/mature Technical Data Package (TDP), to include sustainment engineering support and maturation of the TDP

  Mitigate the learning curve/impacts (trained personnel, maintenance, and situational awareness, etc.) on maintenance and operations during transition following Award of Contract

  Ensure seamless transition/transfer of crew training, Prime Mission Equipment (PME) and facilities including operations and sustainment to Services/organic organizations

  Perform stockpile reliability and integration of GBI(s)

  Troubleshoot (Build in Test (BIT)), emplace/extract and maintain GBI(s)

  Upgrade GMD system to achieve full Information Assurance (IA) compliance in accordance with DoD 8500.2
 

7.  Integration of Capability into GMD System:  The Government is requesting information from interested parties on their ability to successfully transition and execute ongoing development, integration and/or fielding activities related to key GMD developmental capabilities.  Interested parties should address their ability to:
 

  Complete integration of the Thule UEWR into GMD

  Perform integration of the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) into the GBI. 
  
  Complete development, integration and fielding of the Simultaneous Test and Operations (STO) upgrades

  Perform development, integration, and fielding of Multiple TPY-2 Sensor Fusion capability

  Perform development, integration, and fielding of System Track, GEM Integration, and Common X-band Interface upgrades


8.  Data Requirements:  MDA is developing a technical data library to support the planned additional RFIs on these requirements.  Please provide a detailed description of documentation requirements for the technical library to support your development of a competitive proposal and the execution of the contract if awarded to your company or team as the prime contractor.


9.  Additional Considerations:  The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.
  

Any business firms and/or teams interested in responding to this RFI are invited to prepare and submit (no later than 31 December 2007) a white paper (not to exceed 20 pages plus associated briefing charts) and give a capability presentation (outlining the key issues of that white paper) to the Government.
  

Interested firms should submit an email stating your interest in presenting such a briefing to the Government no later than 3 December 2007 to Paula Parker at paula.parker@mda.mil (title your email either GMD Follow-on Acquisition Briefing or GMD PBL Acquisition Briefing or GMD Follow-on and PBL Acquisition Briefing).
  

All responses to this notice should include the following: Company Name, Point of Contact, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers, Email Address, DUNS Number, CAGE Code and/or Tax ID Number. 


If proposing recommendations as a team, the presentation must reflect the team's probable membership, organization, and approach. 
 

Proposed capability presentations/briefings are tentatively scheduled to begin on or about 7 January 2008.  Each firm and/or team will be given a seven day notice of the scheduled date for your capability presentation. Each firm and/or team will provide the government with a read ahead or draft copy of the capabilities briefing at least five working days before your scheduled briefing date. It is recognized that updates and changes could occur. Submissions can be electronic with hard copy provided during the capabilities briefing. The tentative plan is to permit each firm and/or team up to two (2) hours to present their capabilities. Back up charts can be submitted but only in support of the initial charts versus additional information. At the government's discretion, additional time may be permitted for discussion and dialogue to ensure there is complete understanding of the material presented.

<SUBJECT>84 -- Update - FPI's Production in FS Group 84
<DESC>This notice updates the FedBizOpps notice posted on January 4, 2005, concerning FPI?s production in Federal Supply (FS) Group 84 - Clothing, Individual Equipment and Insignia.  The January 4, 2005 notice detailed additional production due to a national exigency.  Since that time, while still under the national exigency provision, FPI has received another request from the Department of Defense (DoD) for additional requirements for Navy Blue Coveralls.  The Navy requested that FPI increase their monthly production for the Navy coveralls from 25,000 units per month in FY 2007 to 35,000 units per month in FY 2008 or approximately, 420,000 coveralls per year.  The Clothing and Textiles Business Group?s original plan for FY 2008 was to reduce coveralls to 15,000 units per month.  However, the new request will now result in an increase in production of and sales of Navy coveralls by 20,000 units per month over the FY 2008 plan.  The increase will be in effect for a twelve-month period with deliveries beginning February 2008 through January 2009.  It is anticipated that the request will increase the work clothing category above their previously projected sales for FY 2008.  The additional coverall production will increase the work clothing ceiling by approximately $5 million for the designated time period.  As with the previous request, the ?national exigency? provision is temporary, allowing FPI to exceed the normal sales ceilings while the exigency is in effect.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher level as a future production baseline.  FPI and DoD are uncertain as to how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing military war efforts and the continuing war on terrorism.  At a minimum, however, it is expected that the increased production levels as a result of DoD?s expanded needs will continue through Fiscal Year 2009.  
	Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI?s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention: SBDM Branch.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP), Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), Contracting Office, located at 655 Fairton-Millville Road, Fairton, New Jersey, 08320  is requesting quotations for replacing well pump controls located in the Federal Correctional Institution, Fairton, New Jersey.  All work will be performed at the FCI located at 655 Fairton-Millville Road, Fairton, New Jersey 08320.

STATEMENT OF WORK AND SPECIFICATIONS:

INTRODUCTION

	            Federal Correctional Institution Fairton New Jersey is accepting bids for work to be performed on its domestic water system controls. The contractor will be responsible for furnishing all equipment, materials, technical expertise, labor, transportation, tools and any other supplies required to meet requirements of this Statement of Work. If there is any damage to the property due to negligence, the contractor will take sole responsibility for all repairs. Any spillage or leakage clean up costs will be the responsibility of the contractor. The Federal Correctional Institution reserves the right to request proof of proper disposal of any and all hazardous waste generated during this work.

PROJECT LOCATION

All work will be performed at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fairton, located at 655 Fairton-Millville Road, Fairton, New Jersey 08320.

SUMMARY
Buildings and Facilities project 2KS was established to perform repairs on the water system controls located in the domestic water pump-house at FCI Fairton. The system consists of four electric pumps (one 10 HP and three 20 HP) which are vertically mounted and joined at a common header. Currently, the system is run manually, whereas pumps come on successively in response to decreasing water pressure, in turn the pumps shut down in the same fashion as water pressure demands are met. The old system with its frequent on/off control of pumps, caused them to fail, most likely due to over stressing/overheating from repeated high startup current conditions.  For this reason, and in an effort to minimize water pressure fluctuations, a variable-drive, on-demand system is desired. Moreover, due to different levels of water usage at various times of the day, it is not cost effective to have two 20hp pumps running in the early morning hours creating a higher than normal domestic water pressure condition. 
	
Note: Due to the necessity to maintain a supply of water at all times to the institution, the work may need to be done in a manner where at least one of the pumps remains in service while the others are being worked on.

Desired Features

General system features shall include:
	?	Electronic monitoring and display of domestic water pressure that includes a new panel/display box, which will be moisture/corrosion resistant due to the wet pump house environment.
			 
	?	Variable speed drive, on-demand pump utilization scheme using the existing four pumps.
			
	?	Appropriate pump motor startup components, to be located in new panel/display box.

Panel/display features:
Pump on/off status.
		
System water pressure.

Fault/pump failure conditions.

Pump Failure Feature
The system/display should be able to detect whether each pump is actually energized and properly pumping water.  In the event of a pump failure the system, as part of its on-demand pump on/off scheme, should have the capability to ?ignore? or ?skip? the failed pump(s), and energize the next operating pump in its place.  In addition, the controller should visually and audibly indicate to the operator any failed pump(s).

QUALITY ASSURANCE
The work will be performed by a contractor who regularly engages in the business of maintenance and repair of water control apparatuses as required in this statement of work.

SCOPE

During the repairs, all work must be coordinated correctly. Due to the necessity to maintain a supply of water at all times to the institution, the work must be done in a manner where at a minimum one of the pumps  remain in operation while the others are being worked on. 

Removal of existing control box/panel/displays. 

Removal of existing non-functioning system components (e.g. pressure switches).

Installation of any electrical wiring and conduit in support of the new control system.	Once the vessel is cleaned, it must be sanitized before it is placed back into service. 

Installation of above-described variable drive, on-demand pump control system.

Replacement of existing pump motor startup components with compatible relays and starters.

Post-installation system check to ensure proper operation and achievement of all specified design objectives.

TERMS

All personnel will be required to pass background checks before starting work. 
Normal work hours will be 7:30 to 4:00 p.m. All work will be accomplished during normal hours, unless prior arrangements are made in writing between the institution and the contractor. 
No work will be performed on Saturday and Sunday and all Federal Holiday?s unless agreed upon in writing.
MSDS sheets will be required for chemicals that are used on the site.
The contractor is responsible for all debris and trash. 
The contractor may have a dumpster on the site if necessary.
Rest rooms will be available for use.
Electrical power if needed is available from existing buildings.
A staging area for material and supplies will be designated by Facilities.
The performance period for this contract is sixty (60)		calendar days.

SUBMITTALS
Submittals will be made in accordance with these specifications and prior to the ordering of any materials.  Submit two copies to FCI Fairton.  FCI Fairton will then forward these to the Northeast Regional Office for approval. 
 
COMPLETION
Upon completion of the work, remove excess debris, materials, equipment, apparatus, tools and the like and leave premises clean, neat and orderly

SUMMARY
Buildings and Facilities project 2JZ was established to perform repairs on the calcite water treatment filters located in the water treatment plant at FCI Fairton. The system consists of two large calcite filtration vessels, 72" O.D. x 96" H.  They are connected in parallel to the water supply source.  Each vessel is furnished with a 4" flanged in a fluent inlet and a 4" flanged effluent outlet.  Inside each vessel, connected to both the in fluent inlet and an effluent outlet is a network made of PVC piping.  On the in fluent side, the network construction consists of a main PVC header, with approximately fourteen smaller laterals, each made of perforated PVC piping, spaced evenly to disperse the water throughout the media bed.  On the effluent side, there is also a main header with similar laterals, to accept the filtered water.  Each vessel has two service personnel entry ports - one on the top, and one on the lower part.

See the following changes: 1)  Change this RFQ/Solicitation response due date from 20 November 2007 to 28 November 2007, due by 4 P.M. Eastern Time (ET).    2)  Change the OCI provision and clause language as indicated below.  A) OCI Certification/Disclosure language in the provision portion of the solicitation in section G and in the OCI statement in section 1.8 of the statement of work.     Change Language from the Original OCI Statement:   The following OCI statement is included in the statement of work:  In order to avoid an organizational conflict of interest and attempt to ensure an objective and unbiased evaluation, anyone who at the time of the Contractor's submission of an offer or any time thereafter is involved with loss adjustment or sales of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) crop insurance programs related to this Order or receives funding or other benefits, including crop insurance proceeds, from insurance providers that currently conduct crop loss adjustment and sales of this program;  shall not be eligible to participate in the performance of this Order as a prime Contractor or subcontractor.   Accordingly, any person or entity who at the time of submission of offer or any time thereafter conducts loss adjustment, is involved in sales of the GRP program, or receives funding, including crop loss insurance proceeds, from insurance providers who currently conduct crop loss adjustment and sales of the program policies, may not participate in the activities of this Order as a Contractor or subcontractor.  Further, any individual, Contractor or subcontractor who worked in the performance of this Order may be deemed ineligible to participate in additional or future Orders resulting from the recommendations for the GRP program. Change Language to the New OCI Statement: The following OCI statement is included in the statement of work:  In order to avoid an organizational conflict of interest and attempt to ensure an objective and unbiased evaluation, anyone who at the time of the Contractor's submission of an offer or any time thereafter is involved with loss adjustment or sales of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) crop insurance programs related to this Order or receives funding or other benefits, including crop insurance proceeds, from insurance providers that currently conduct crop loss adjustment or sales of this program; or, anyone who participated substantially in the development or maintenance of the crop insurance program related to this Order, shall not be eligible to participate in the performance of this Order as a prime Contractor or subcontractor. Accordingly, any person or entity who at the time of submission of offer or any time thereafter conducts loss adjustment, is involved in sales of the GRP program, or receives funding, including crop loss insurance proceeds, from insurance providers who currently conduct crop loss adjustment and sales of the program policies, may not participate in the activities of this Order as a Contractor or subcontractor.

B)  OCI clause in the statement of work section 1.8, pages 17 & 18.   Change Language from the Original OCI Clause: a)  It is the intent of this Agency to avoid awarding Orders that could create potential conflicts of interest. Such a situation could occur in the execution of this Order when the Contractor or any subcontractors have an agreement or employment arrangement in effect with any person or entity currently involved with loss adjustment or sales of the Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIC) crop insurance programs related to this Order, or receives or employs any person who receives funding or other benefits, including crop loss insurance proceeds, from insurance providers that currently conduct crop loss adjustment and sales of program policies. Such interests bias a Contractor's judgment, either negatively or positively and thus impede the Government's objective of obtaining an unbiased, technically sound performance of the work. b)  Prior to the commencement of any work, the Contractor agrees to notify the Contracting Officer that to the best of its knowledge and belief, no actual or potential conflict of interest exists or to identify to the Contracting Officer any actual or potential conflict of interest the Contractor may have. c)  The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is identified during performance, the Contractor will immediately make a full disclosure, in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest. d)  Remedies- Acquisition Services Directorate may terminate this Order for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose it; or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the Order for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this Order. e)  The Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph in all subcontracts and consultant agreements provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph, unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. f)  The Contracting Officer's decision as to the existence or nonexistence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest shall be final. Change Language to the New OCI Clause: ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST a)  It is the intent of this Agency to avoid awarding Orders that could create potential conflicts of interest.  Such a situation could occur in the execution of this Order when the Contractor or any subcontractors are involved with adjusting claims or selling policies of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) crop insurance programs related to this Order or receives other funding or benefits from insurance providers that currently conduct crop loss adjustment or sales of this program; or, if the Contractor or any subcontractors participated substantially in the development or maintenance of the crop insurance program related to this Order. Such interests bias a Contractor's judgment, either negatively or positively and thus impede the Government's objective of obtaining an unbiased, technically sound performance of the work. b)  Potential conflicts of interest could also occur in the execution of this Order when the Contractor or any subcontractors have an agreement or employment arrangement in effect with another Offeror under this solicitation or another Contractor having an active contract with the Risk Management Agency.

<SUBJECT>R -- Review of FCA's Examiner Training
<SOLNBR>08-RFQ-02
<RESPDATE>102607
<CONTACT>Tracy Reeves, Purchasing Agent, Phone 703-883-4111, Fax 703-883-4151, Email reevest@fca.gov - Philip Shebest, FCA Agency Administrator, Phone 703-883-4135, Fax 703-893-2608, Email shebestp@fca.gov
<DESC>Amendment 2 - to include additional questions/answers.  No more questions will be accepted.

1.  What issues are driving the FCA to make this assessment now? What challenges does the FCA hope the consulting engagement will overcome?
The Commission Test and training programs leading to the test have not undergone a major review since the inception of the test in the late 1980's.  No particular challenges; however, we would like the FCA Commissioning Test benchmarked against the testing the other Financial Regulators conduct. 

2.  Will the contractor be limited to a review of the written documentation or may they meet with examiners/trainers or watch them lead courses? 
Yes, we anticipate meetings.  FCA's headquarters is in McLean, VA and we have four field locations (Bloomington, MN, Dallas, TX, Denver, CO, and Sacramento, CA).  Most of the examiners (pre- and post) are located in the field locations.   

3.  Will the contractor be visiting sites and/or meeting with trainees/trainers anywhere but in McLean?
See Question number 12 on first amendment.

4.  What is the estimated volume of written documentation to be reviewed?
There are approximately 10 pre-commissioning training programs ranging in length from 2 to 4 days each.  There are 4 career tracks for post-commissioned examiners.  The Pre-Commission Test combines multiple choice questions (written test) and simulations (oral test) which takes approximately 3 days in total.  An overview of the structure of the training programs and test is what is requested in this contract - it is not the specific content of the courses.  For example, length of time it takes to eligible to sit for the test, the methods of training employees (e.g. mentors, classroom training versus blended learning, etc.).  

5.  Will the contractor have access to Subject Matter Experts, evaluators/trainers, and learners at each level (for focus groups and/or surveys)?
See question number 13 on first amendment.

6.  What kind of support can the agency provide to enable the contractor to quickly and cost-effectively conduct web surveys of various learner groups/stakeholders?
The FCA IT staff can work with the contractor to set up and deliver a web based survey if it is determined by the contractor and FCA that this is needed. 

7.  Please confirm that the final report needs to be delivered to the FCA within 60 days of award of contract.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF 

Any claim for relief filed by a offeror shall be adjudicated by the FCA Contracting Officer. If the parties cannot reach an agreement mutually satisfactory after diligently pursuing a solution through discussions and negotiations, the FCA Contracting Officer shall make a final decision. The FCA Contracting Officer's decision shall prevail unless the offeror submits an appeal to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The decision of the CFO shall be final and binding on the parties.

<DESC>Amendment to include questions/answers.

1.    Since you indicated that the solicitation is an RFQ, how much detail and narrative information does the Agency require as a component of the response and as necessary for a determination?
 
The Agency has no specific requirement, however, sufficient information should be provided to allow the Agency to evaluate the qualifications of the consultant and the suggested approach that would be taken for the review, including discussions on how the consultant will approach the technical requirements and accomplish the work.  The Agency has no page limit. 

2. Does the Agency intend to contract for services based on the responses received? 

Yes, the Agency intends to contract after reviewing all responses from companies bidding on the contract. 

 
3. As the Agency indicates an urgent need for completion of the contract within 60 days from date of award, how soon after the response date (10/26/07) will responses be reviewed and how quickly thereafter does the Agency anticipate a decision to award the contract?  
 
It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded no later than 2 weeks after the response date.


4. What is the length of time required to complete Post-Commission training?

No specific length of time is required for completion of the Post-Commission training program.  Employees may select more than one Post-Commission specialty area.  Generally, employees will pursue one specialty area at a time.  

5. What is an estimate number of persons involved in the FCA Examiner training process during a calendar year, including all stages of Pre- and Post-Commission?
 
Currently there are 34 pre-commission examiners.  Approximately 10 new pre-commission examiners are hired per year.  Currently there are 126 post-commission examiners.  

6. What is an estimate number of FCA Examiners who have completed the current training process since inception?
 
The formal pre-commission training program began in 1986.  Several hundred have completed the pre-commission training program but are no longer with the Agency (e.g. retired, downsized, left for other jobs).

7. Are all FCA Examiners, Pre- and Post-Commission, based in McLean, Virginia?  If not, where are they located?

No, pre- and post-commission examiners are located at all FCA locations throughout the country:  McLean, VA; Sacramento, CA; Dallas, TX; Denver, CO; and Bloomington, MN.  Post-commission examiners are generally equally distributed among these five locations.  

8. Is this review of the Farm Credit Administration's (FCA) Pre and Post Commission Examiner Training Program the first review that FCA has completed? If not, how often have previous reviews been completed? What were the results of those reviews?

This is the first external review of the FCA post-commission training program. Since it's inception in 1986, the pre-commission training program has been reviewed numerous times with minor modifications.  

9. Under Scope on page two of the Statement of Work (SOW), the SOW states that the "...scope of the review is ... to determine whether the Agency is effectively using its resources in the most efficient way to train its staff."

a. What existing metrics does the FCA use to determine efficiency in its personnel training programs? Examples of metrics could include:
i. Stated level of satisfaction with the training program by trainers, students,
leadership team, etc.;
ii. Retention of program students by the FCA during and after completion of the
program;
iii. Cost per entering student and cost per graduating student.

FCA does not use a formal metrics system to determine efficiency in its training programs.  This is something we would like the contractor to do.  However, at the conclusion of each training program an evaluation of the course content and instructors is given to all students.  Learning and retention is determined by if the student passes the commissioning test at the conclusion of all formal and on-the-job training programs. 

10. Under "Deliverables" on page three of the SOW, the SOW states that the review will "[b]enchmark FCA's delivery methodology ...against best practices in the federal government and private practice."

a. What set or group of "best practices in the federal government and private practice"
does FCA's management want to use in the review?
b. Is FCA's management interested in employing benchmarks used by similar federal entities (e.g., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Reserve System, or the Office of Federal Enterprise Housing Oversight)?
c. Are there other benchmarks that FCA's management would like to use for this review? If so, what are they?

FCA would like the contractor to benchmark federal bank regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Reserve Board, National Credit Union Association, and Office of the Federal Enterprise Housing Oversight.  Other optional organizations will be determined in consultation with the contractor.  

11. Under "Term of the Contract" on page four of the SOW, the SOW states that this review will need to be completed "...within 60 days from the date of award."

a. How soon does FCA's management expect this project to begin (e.g. Nov/Dec 2007 or January 2008)?
b. When does FCA's management want this project to be completely finished, including the submission of the final report and the completion of all review related meetings with FCA's management?

It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded no later than two weeks after the submission deadline. Work will begin in November and the contractor should provide FCA with the final report in January 2008. 

12. Other than local travel in and around the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, what are the out-of-town travel necessities to complete this review? Will the reasonable expenses for that travel be reimbursed by FCA?

In addition to visits to McLean, it is anticipated that the contractor will make one visit to FCA offices in Dallas, TX and Sacramento, CA.  At the discretion of the contractor in consultation with FCA, the contractor may visit the remaining FCA offices throughout the country which includes Denver, CO and Minneapolis, MN.  Since the contract is firm fixed price contract, travel expenses are the responsibility of the contractor. 

13. Will FCA's management permit in-person and telephone interviews between the selected consultant and members of FCA's professional staff as part of this review?

Yes, in person and telephone interviews are encouraged.  

14.  Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing these services?

No.

15.  Will SMEs or instructors be available (e.g., by phone or via email) for interviews regarding the training? 
 
Yes

16.  Will past participants be available (e.g., by phone or via email) for interviews regarding the training? 
 
Yes
 
17.  Will we be able to review the scores for any written or on-the-job assessments that participants have completed during the course? 
 
Yes 

18.  Will some observation of ongoing training be possible? 
 
Yes

<DESC>Amendment 3 to include questions previously submitted:

1.	Will SMEs or instructors be available (e.g., by phone or via email) for interviews regarding the training? 
Yes.

2.	Will past participants be available (e.g., by phone or via email) for interviews regarding the training? 
Yes.

3.	Will we be able to review the scores for any written or on-the-job assessments that participants have completed during the course? 
You will be able to see the test scores for the Commissioning Test.  We do not keep copies of test given at the conclusion of each training course that is part of the pre- and post-commission training program.  An on-the-job list of tasks that must be completed by each pre-commissioned employee is maintained by the employee and his/her supervisor.  We can provide a sample of this check list.  Note:  The pre-commission training program consists of a series of classes and on-the-job tasks that takes approximately 3 to 5 years to complete before employees are allowed to sit for the Commissioning Test. 

4.	Will some observation of ongoing training be possible?
Yes, if it is determined desirable by the contractor and FCA.

SCOPE OF WORK
All wood moldings shall be AWI Grade Mahogany pre-finished in shop. Contractor shall
provide stain chart for the Governments selection of stain color. After selection the contractor
shall furnish wood samples finished for the courts approval. Contractor should view the job site
prior to bid submittal. Note in attached scope the size of the elevator for delivery to the third

outlets and boxes in base with pull string for data.
The bookcases should be built in three foot sections except for the flanking cases that are to be 3

Except for the base, that is intended to match the profile of the existing baseboard in the room,
there is some flexibility in the molding profiles. A stock molding profile of the approximate size
and profile will be acceptable upon approval.
The library room is located on the second floor of the courthouse with access being by a
passenger elevator measuring 5? 7? wide x 3? 11? deep (about 8? additional depth at the door)
and 7? 6? high or by a set of stairs with winders rather than a landing, Should modifications be
needed to ease the transit to the intended space such as the cap and/or the base being constructed
separately, these modifications would be acceptable as long as the intent of the design is
maintained.
There will be a need for coordinating the work with an electrician and our data phone contractor.
The Court will handle that aspect of the work.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG23-07-R-TE4213 is hereby amended to respond to the following questions received by the deadline of 12:00 Noon EDT on Monday, September 10, 2007.

QUESTION 1: Section A, Item 4.  Shall be equipped with DES-CFB, DES-OFB and AES Encryption:
DES-CFB and DES-OFB encryption is contradictory with FIPS publication 140.  DES-CFB and DES-OFB encryption modes do not meet the requirements of FIPS-140 as of May, 2007.  According to NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1 Transition Plan for the Use of Key Sizes and Security Strengths by Federal Agencies?  After the transition period ending on May 19, 2007: 
a. The use of keys of less than 80-bits of security strength shall not be allowed for use in a FIPS Approved mode of operation for use by Federal agencies. 
b.  A minimum of 80-bits of security strength shall be required through 2010. 
c.  From 2011 through 2030, a minimum of 112 bits of security strength shall be required. 
d. Thereafter, at least 128 bits of security strength shall be required. 
It is our understanding that this policy is in place to prevent discussing sensitive information using less than secure communication channels.  It is better for the user to understand the communication channel is unsecured than to have a false sense of security.
The requirement for DES-CFB and DES-OFB (56-bit key) encryption should be removed because it is not allowed for use by Federal Agencies.  Removing DES-CFB will also expand the number of commercially available products that are otherwise acceptable for this RFP.
Will the government eliminate the requirement for DES-CFB and DES-OFB?

ANSWER 1: No.  The government requires the capability to maintain communications with legacy equipment using DES encryption.  Coast Guard and other government agencies continue to operate DES-encrypted radio systems under waivers of the NIST publication cited above.

QUESTION 2: Section A, Item 11.  Shall be capable of upgrading to Project 25 Trunking:
Will the government accept replacement of the radio at a reduced price as an alternative to upgrading?

ANSWER 2: No.  Replacement of radios will increase the Government?s cost to deploy and maintain these radios.

QUESTION 3: Section A, item 14.  Shall have a minimum of 500 channels:  
This requirement eliminates a number of commercially available products that may otherwise meet the technical aspects of the solicitation.  
Will the government consider a product that offers 400 channels to be acceptable?

ANSWER 3: No.  The minimum requirement is 500 channels.

QUESTION 4: Section C, Item 2:  Multiple?Radio charger capable of charging 6 radios simultaneously.
This requirement appears tailored to a particular radio vendor.  Multi-Radio chargers are offered by various radio vendors that charge 4, 5 or 6 radios simultaneously.  
Will the government consider 4, 5 or 6 unit Multi-Radio chargers acceptable?

ANSWER 4: Yes.  

QUESTION 5: Can the government provide anticipated contract award date, expected initial delivery order date and expected quantity of units in initial delivery order?

ANSWER 5: It is anticipated that an award and the initial delivery order will be made by the end of this Fiscal Year. It is estimated that a minimum of 1000 radios will be initially ordered.

QUESTION 6: Section 1 Technical Capability:  The proposal should outline an effective, efficient and achievable capability for accomplishing the work within the timeline specified by either performance periods or documented in a deliverable schedule.

Can the government provide more details or examples of the information desired?

ANSWER 6: Answer: The criterion remains as stated.

QUESTION 7: Proposal Submission Section:  ??first binder shall contain your Technical and Relevant Price Performance information?
Did the government mean Relevant Past Performance information?

ANSWER 7: Yes

QUESTION 8: We consider that we have a realistic solution to the specification included in the RFP; however we recognize the need to gather specific internal commitments and we need more time.  Can we be granted a one-week extension to responding to this request?

ANSWER 8: No. The Coast Guard intends to make an award by the end of this fiscal year, hence the need to keep to the current proposal deadline as posted.

QUESTION 9: Is there a minimum order quantity the Coast Guard will procure through the single award.  There was some confusion regarding the $21.5M figure associated with 9500 units.

ANSWER 9: As stated in the solicitation, this will be a Requirements Contract for a period of 24 months with at approximate total of $21.5M. It is estimated that a minimum of 1000 radios will be initially ordered.

<CONTACT>Linda Bayer
<DESC>Combined synopsis/solicitation VA-760-08-RQ-0003 is amended as follows: The offer will be evaluated for both technical merit and price reasonableness.  The offeror must assure that the technical factors are adequately addressed.  In order to provide full consideration of the offeror's qualifications for award, the offeror is encouraged to ensure that the information furnished is factual, accurate and complete.  The offeror may provide additional technical information to enhance the offer; however, overly elaborate presentations are not desired. 1.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes, in descending order of importance: (i) Technical Capability  a.	Provide a statement of work addressing how the offeror plans to accomplish the requirement.  The statement of work will contain how the modification to existing equipment will be performed and a time line.   b.	Past performance:  provide a minimum of three (3) current references from organizations (Federal, State, local government, or private) under which you have provided the same services required in this solicitation for which you have performed services similar to those required under this contract.  Include dates of performance, organization name, address, contact person, telephone number, and reason for termination/cancellation, as applicable. (ii)  Price; 2.  Technical Capability is more important when compared to Price. Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  In addition to contacting references, the Government may use information from its own files, database sources available for government use such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and Contractor Performance System (CPS), public internet sources, or any other source the Government deems appropriate.   The CMOP's evaluation team consists of CMOP employees who have expertise and knowledge of system.  The CMOP deems these representatives as experts; therefore, they are qualified to evaluate information considering product quality and consistency and price and other factors to determine which proposal is the "best value" to the Government.   The Government intends to evaluate offers and award without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.   Response/due date is hereby extended from November 28, 2007 to December 5, 2007, 2:30 PM Central Time.
