Synopsis: 

This procurement is for seismic upgrades and renovation of ship maintenance facility, building 431 at Naval Base Kitsap, Bremerton, WA. This procurement uses the source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15. This procurement is for design-bid-build (DBB) construction services and will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.

Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed-price repair and construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), offers the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff source selection process.
   The tradeoff process is being utilized because it may be in the best interest of the government to consider awarding to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the highest technically rated Offeror.

This DBB project includes bringing the original 1933 building and its later additions up to code and incidental related work.   The project includes the retrofit and renovation of an existing 557,426 square foot ship maintenance facility to current structural and seismic standards, including significant demolition of the building interior, renovation of all architectural, mechanical and electrical systems, and hazardous material remediation.  The project will be located at Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, WA.
 The estimated total contract price range, in accordance with FAR 36.204, is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.

This procurement shall be in accordance with Buy American clauses FAR 52.225-11 and 12. The firm needs to be able to demonstrate knowledge, current relevant qualifications, experience, bonding, and the capability to perform a DBB repair and construction contract similar to the scope indicated. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Price, Factor 1  Experience, Factor 2  Past Performance, Factor 3  Safety, and Factor 4  Technical Solution, and Factor 5 Small Business Utilization.
  

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) https://www.neco.navy.mil/ on or about February 5, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION. Prospective Offerors MUST register on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. 

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this announcement, attending pre-proposal conferences or any follow-up information requests.
  

Results of Sources Sought
A sources sought was used to conduct market research to determine if qualified small businesses were interested in performing this project.  The sources sought notice was issued using solicitation number N4425514R5006, which was posted on September 10, 2014 with a due date of September 24, 2014. The sources sought requested responses from interested prime contractors and statements of capabilities.   The Government received a total of one response from a small business.

<DESC>SUBJECT: HC/MC-130J Technical Order (TO) Sustainment
<p>NOTE: This request is not a solicitation. Please do not submit a proposal.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>(a) Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in FedBizOpps. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in the response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>
<p>(b) Responses for Planning Purposes Only: Responses provided are strictly voluntary and will not affect ability to submit an offer if or when a formal solicitation is released. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a follow-on procurement action will be issued. No Government entitlement of direct costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
<p>(a) Background: The Government is conducting market research to identify possible sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively sustain HC/MC-130J operation and maintenance (both O-Level and D-Level) Technical Orders (TOs). There are approximately 270 maintenance TOs (HC/MC-130J), 17 HC-130J operator TOs, and 17 MC-130J operator TOs. Size of TOs ranges from 45 to 1800 pages. Page count for the quarterly change cycles will vary based on the number of Publication Change Requests (PCRs) processed each cycle and the number of pages impacted by the changes. All TOs are currently provided as both Indexed-Portable Document Files (iPDF) and PDF print formats only. The offeror should not assume native digital files (i.e. SGML, XML, Frame Maker, etc.) will be available. For larger change packages the offeror may need to convert the complete TO (text and graphics) to a digital file and process the action as a revision. All change/revision packages are to be completed and ready for Government review 30 days prior to quarterly distribution, except in the case of Emergency or Urgent Action situations. All technical data shall be in the same style/format of current HC/MC-130J TOs.</p>
<p>(b) Purpose: The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with ascertaining interest in competing for sustainment of HC/MC-130J TOs. Interested parties should respond to this RFI with capability statements which include/address the following information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Describe your past experience (no more than five examples) to include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Program name and branch of service responsible for management of program<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Description of the effort (i.e. development of new TOs or sustainment)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Date and period of performance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Overall cost of effort and a breakdown of estimated cost per page for;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Text changes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Half-page illustration changes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Full-page illustration changes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Full-page wiring/schematic diagram changes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Foldout page wiring/schematic diagram changes</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Respondents to this RFI should assume Government will be unable to provide a complete set of HC/MC-130J TOs to offeror if a contract is awarded. Respondents should fully explain their plan to obtain the HC/MC-130J TOs or source data from the current vendor. Respondents should define how HC/MC-130J TOs will be stored and safeguarded to prevent unauthorized access and/or disclosure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Respondents should define how changes will be processed, change pages developed, and Government reviews are managed (location and duration). In addition respondent should briefly describe their internal quality assurance process. If respondent intends to make teaming arrangements to meet requirements, the RFI response should identify potential teaming arrangements and roles and responsibilities. The prime contractor will be responsible for the overall performance of this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Responses should address any risks foreseen in performing this effort. Respondents should address any steps they would likely take to mitigate the risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Respondents should provide a notional schedule based on the quarterly distribution requirement. Schedule should clearly identify milestones to be met during a typical change cycle to include Government reviews. For planning purposes the Government would start receiving completed change/revision packages in the 3QTR FY16 timeframe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a Historically Underutilized Business zone small business concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is foreign-owned.</p>
<p>(c) RFI Format: Interested sources must respond with a complete RFI package of no more than 10 pages, providing all information requested above. All parties are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number and an e-mail address in their response.</p>
<p>(d) Date Response Required and Point of Contact: Responses should be received no later than 13 Feb 2015. Responses should be sent electronically to Mr. Richard Saltsman at richard.saltsman@us.af.mil, and Ms. Katherine Hamblin at katherine.hamblin@us.af.mil.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This notice is for MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, and in no way obligates the United States Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award. <br />Background:</p>
<p>The US Department of Defense (DoD) initiated the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) in Africa through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to secure and consolidate select agents; enhance Biosafety and Biosecurity (BS&amp;S) standards; and strengthen Africa's ability to detect, diagnose, survey, and report emerging and re-emerging diseases of international security concern, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR) and World Health Organization for Animal Health Guidelines (OIE). To achieve its mission, CBEP works collaboratively with partner nations, U.S. Government agencies, and the international community to enhance disease surveillance diagnostic and reporting capabilities; develop human resource expertise in public and animal health, promote safe and secure laboratory working environments; and consolidate pathogens of security concern into a minimal number of safe and secure facilities in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to identify interested sources capable of performing a baseline analysis of the bio-surveillance (BSV) and BS&amp;S systems, capabilities, and gaps, in the following four East/South African countries: South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. The analysis and follow on report will inform the implementation phase of CBEP in East/South Africa. Any contractor who may perform the initial assessments would not be excluded from any follow on activities as a result of the baseline analysis.</p>
<p>The following are samples of what the U.S. Government may require as part of the baseline analysis:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide an environmental scan of the national/ministerial and regional human and animal health levels to baseline current capabilities in the aforementioned East/South African countries. Specific attention should be paid to the countries' capacities to:<br />o Rapidly and accurately survey, detect, diagnose, and report biological terrorism and outbreaks of pathogens and diseases of security concern.<br />o Conduct epidemiological investigation, laboratory diagnostics, and international reporting of diseases of security concern.<br />o Use modern diagnostics and advanced scientific methods commensurate with the technological capacity of the country/region to identify pathogens of security concern and potential disease outbreaks.<br />o Comply with international reporting standards and guidelines under the WHO IHR (2005), OIE Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway, and other relevant requirements. <br />o Link disease surveillance and reporting systems to national, regional, and global outbreak response systems, including multi-sector engagement.<br />o Implement systems for managing and securing samples and collections of pathogens of security concern that are consistent with internationally recognized performance standards. <br />o Provide tools for enhanced biological security and safety measures throughout the public and animal health system, which include: sample collection, detection and diagnostics, sample transport, and destruction and/or storage of materials.<br />o Train medical personnel, scientists, veterinarians to quickly and accurately detect, diagnose, and report biological outbreaks of pathogens and disease of security concern.<br />o Equip medical personnel, veterinarians, and first responders with personal protection equipment.<br />o Equip and train field works on the use of rapid detection kits.<br />o Rapidly and effectively provide infection control in all regions and border posts.<br />&bull; Identify gaps between DTRA's CBEP objectives and current country capabilities, to include:<br />o Meeting international guidelines for a sustainable Disease, Detection, Surveillance, and Response (DDSR) system.<br />o Complying with international best practices for BS&amp;S legislation.<br />o Leveraging existing collaborative partnerships with in-country U.S. Government (USG) stakeholders and partner country institutes and government organizations.<br />&bull; Develop a baseline of the existing DDSR, BSV and BS&amp;S systems<br />o Identify applicable stakeholders<br />o Identify legal framework, budgets<br />o Operational processes, products, reports, frequency</p>
<p>Response Requirements:</p>
<p>The U.S. Government invites sources to respond to this RFI that have the capability to meet these parameters and would have an interest to bid on a requirement of similar objectives. Responses shall be limited to five (5) pages including diagrams. Pages not included in the total page count are the cover page, the cover letter and the table of contents.</p>
<p>Any and all information submitted in response to this notice is strictly voluntary and in no way obligates the U.S. Government to a monetary compensation or otherwise to make a contract award. The U.S. Government will not return any submitted data and information. The responder may solicit input on technical aspects of the responses from non-government consultants/experts bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions:</p>
<p>Responses shall be limited to five (5) 8X11 pages and shall:</p>
<p>&bull; Confirm source's ability and interest to meet purpose and objectives provided;<br />&bull; Identify any aspects of the requirements stated that cannot be met and any issues/concerns with the requirements as stated;<br />&bull; Assess whether purpose and objectives can be accomplished within six to nine months, or provide a realistic alternative timeframe for completion; <br />&bull; Provide information on past performance, preferably in but not limited to Eastern and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>The responder should provide information to Contract Specialist Alicia McPeters at Alicia.McPeters@dtra.mil no later than February 27, 2015</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes:</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information. There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for Solicitation and inquiries related to same will not receive a response. THIS NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, AND IN NO WAY OBLIGATES THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR OTHERWISE MAKE A CONTRACT AWARD. Any and all information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this notice and shall become the property of DTRA/SCC-WMD. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organizations qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, DTRA CBEP may issue a pre-solicitation synopsis. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation which may be published in the future.</p>
<p>Confidentiality:</p>
<p>No classified or confidential information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s). Any proprietary information should be clearly marked.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>INTRODUCTION <br /></strong></p>
<p>
<p>On behalf of the federal Mobile Technology Tiger Team (MTTT), a working group level organization within the Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC) of the Federal CIO Council, the Enterprise Mobility Program within the General Services Administration Office of Integrated Technology Services (ITS) is seeking comments and information related to the commercial factors, capabilities, and considerations for extending the Mobile Security Baseline to cover State, Local Tribal and Territorial (SSLT) entities in an information share scenarios.. This endeavor compliments, but does not duplicate, the efforts being undertaken by FirstNet (the First Responders Network Authority).</p>
<p>The basis for this Request for Information (RFI) is the attached document, a draft version entitled "State, Local Tribal and Territorial Mobile Access to Federal Information Systems: Barriers, Opportunities, and Gaps Analysis." This document is a preparatory step toward publication of a Mobile and Wireless Security Baseline for SLTT entities that will share information on Federal systems.</p>
<p>The analysis of requirements for an SLTT Mobile Security Baseline was conducted during a time of technology transformation in which firms started providing solutions in response to the Federal CIO Council's Government Mobile and Wireless Security Baseline published in May 2013. SLTT entities share sensitive information with Federal Departments and Agencies for activities such as:</p>
<p>&bull; Law Enforcement<br />&bull; The National Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative<br />&bull; The National Strategy for Information Sharing<br />&bull; Emergency Management and Disaster Recovery<br />&bull; Infectious Disease Control<br />&bull; State and local Fusion Centers</p>
<p><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>This RFI is intended to afford potential vendors an opportunity to comment, identify their technical capabilities, and provide policy considerations and recommendations. The Government is requesting firms provide their technical capabilities, experience, and recommendations as to how companies approach securing and coordinating mobile communications whereby transactional information may be shared between the Federal Government and SLTT entities. The government is also soliciting recommendations as to what to consider from a practical and policy perspective when extending the Mobile Security Baseline to include SLTT entities.</p>
<p>Based on this brief description, as well as the attached draft of "Barriers, Opportunities, and Gaps Analysis" document, the Government is requesting information on how firms go about designing, deploying and operating systems that produce the desired outcome. We are also requesting firms identify considerations, constraints, and recommendations (including Industry best practices) the government should include in developing the policy of extending the Mobile Security Baseline to SLTT entities.</p>
<p>This requirement is in its initial/planning stage and the requested information will afford the MTTT better understand your industry's delivery capabilities and how they will impact the development of security policy in a way that enables continued FirstNet adoption.</p>
<p>This Request for Information does not in any way imply a planned or pending procurement action by the United States Government. Responses to this RFI can not constitute an offer and shall not be accepted as the basis for forming a binding contract. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this RFI. The government will not reimburse any respondent for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
</p>

This is both a synopsis and a survey to locate potential sources capable of performing the proposed work. It is anticipated that a Contractor will be required for an effort to provide marketing, advertising, and public relations services for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) on behalf of Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration charged with maximizing flood insurance policies. This document may also be considered a synopsis.</p>
<p>NFIP was created by an act of Congress in 1968, and is the largest mono-line insurance operation in the Nation. FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) operates a marketing and advertising program, called FloodSmart and the associated FloodSmart.gov websites to increase awareness of flood risk and to encourage homeowners, renters, condominium owners and business owners to purchase federally-backed flood insurance. The mission of the Risk Insurance Division (RID) is to provide flood insurance to help citizens and their communities effectively recover from flooding events. The vision of RID is a nation where everyone who needs flood insurance has it. This is accomplished through three primary strategic goals:</p>
<p>&bull; Achieve Operational Excellence<br />&bull; Deliver Flood Insurance to the Public<br />&bull; Implement program changes and reforms as directed by Congress</p>
<p><br />The current FloodSmart program consists of ongoing strategic areas of services managed by FIMA's Risk Insurance Division and operated through a multi-year contract. Additionally, independent insurance agents provide write your own (WYO) services where the agents write NFIP policies and the government financially backs the policies. The marketing services are intended to supplement Federal, state, and local government and private sector implementation of Federal statutes and regulations designed to require the purchase of flood insurance in certain circumstances. Varied marketing communications activities are needed to improve understanding of the NFIP, the benefits of flood insurance, and to stimulate interest in and prompt consumer decision-making leading to new purchase and retention of sufficient amounts of flood insurance coverage. Varied marketing communications activities are needed to improve understanding of the NFIP, the benefits of flood insurance, and to stimulate interest in and prompt consumer decision-making leading to the purchase and retention of sufficient amounts of flood insurance coverage. The contractor which performs these services will provide strategic marketing direction, establish advertising campaigns, manage multi-million dollar annual media purchases, provide administrative support, direct and manage: website development and maintenance; government representation and various industry conferences directed to flood insurance stakeholders; provide direct mail and call center support; perform analyses/assessments of various campaigns and actions taken; liaise with all parties of interest (i.e., stakeholders); dynamically propose campaigns modifications, including electronic marketing and social media approaches; and provide accounting system support that comply with Cost Accounting Standards, including the rules and regulations, and audit responsibilities in implementing Section 26 of the Federal Procurement Policy Act, Public Law 100-679 (CAS).</p>
<p>Other functions and responsibilities will be required as reflected in the abbreviated Statement of Objectives that follow. It is anticipated that much of the services cited will be performed by subcontractors so the lead Contractor must be skilled in managing other firms; taking the lead; communicating crisply and accurately; overseeing and accepting responsibility for subcontractor performance. The successful proposer will be able to show superior management and direction skills with its subcontractors.</p>
<p>The NFIP requires a contractor that is capable of providing a full-service integrated marketing, advertising and public relations effort for the National Flood Insurance Program. The contractor shall provide all personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for providing the policy growth requirement</p>
<p>The general areas of ongoing strategic performance include:</p>
<p>1. Day-to-day account service and management. Account management services include, but are not limited to an annual marketing, advertising and public relations plan; target audience strategies; consultative and presentation services; technical services/consultation.<br />2. Marketing strategies, annually or as required, that communicates effectively with the target audiences as described in the program objectives. The Contractor shall evaluate the previous years' programs and advise FEMA on the future course of the marketing effort.</p>
<p>3. Marketing analysis including: research, conduct econometric and other studies in order to provide advice on Program direction. In addition the Contractor shall maintain and enhance databases designed to assess and track policy growth and analyze and measure market penetration. Ad hoc issue reports and quarterly reports on policy growth shall be submitted.</p>
<p>4. Develop annual paid media buys based on funding available. The Program Office allocates funding for these purposes to a SmartLink account. (SmartLink is a payment system operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and is used by government agencies for funding on demand.) As background, to disseminate flood insurance information, FloodSmart conducts a robust paid, direct-response advertising program across television, radio, print, online and direct mail mediums. To accomplish this, the program office establishes an allotment in the DHHS SmartLink account funds to support the execution of the paid media plan that is aligned to the annual Communications Plan approved by the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA). The amount of funds placed in the SmartLink account for each contract year is a minimum of $10 million. FIMA from time to time, when additional funds were available, has increased the amount for paid advertising above and beyond $10 million. As funding increases the Contractor will need to be flexible in its management.</p>
<p>5. Provide for national, regional and local advertisements, develop media schedules, purchase broadcast time, print and internet space, and deliver advertisement materials to appropriate media outlets. The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, supplies, tools, travel and all things necessary to create, design and deliver television, radio, internet, magazine, newspaper, outdoor/transit, static exhibits and displays, and signage advertising materials in support of all programs.</p>
<p>6. Perform pre and post advertisement analytics to assess campaign effectiveness. The Contractor shall perform research and tracking activities. The Contractor shall deliver reports based on information received from: conducting and evaluating target audience opinions; media tracking initiatives; creative and communications research including qualitative and quantitative research studies; and focus groups on prospect/customer attitudes, psychographics and demographics.</p>

<p>8. Contractor shall be responsible for a leads processing system that electronically captures, tracks, transmits, fulfills, and provides reports on lead activity. The leads system must include the ability to receive leads from the postal system, various web interfaces, and in-bound Call Center communications. Transmission of leads to insurance agents registered to receive and respond is to be done efficiently.</p>
<p><br />9. The Contractor will provide complete Public Relations for NFIP. The Contractor shall coordinate with FEMA External Affairs and execute public relations and media relations activities for flood seasonal outreach, quick response to weather events, and critical NFIP issues. The Contractor also manages all aspects of the NFIP radio or television spot advertisements including public service announcements (PSA's). Activities also include, but are not limited to: video testimonials of flood insurance policyholders, social media tracking, and social media utilization. The contractor may also be called upon to produce additional materials to explain various aspects of the NFIP through a variety of media.</p>
<p>10. The Contractor shall maintain and enhance outreach programs designed to foster positive communications with and through the NFIP's multiple stakeholders.</p>
<p><br />11. The Contractor shall maintain and enhance programs designed to assist insurance agents in marketing flood insurance policies.</p>
<p>12.

Examples of conferences to be considered: PIA, Big I, American Bankers Association, National Association of Realtors, Mortgage Bankers Association, Young Insurance Professionals, International Association of Insurance Professionals, and others. Consideration should also be given to strategically important regional conferences and tradeshows. Additionally, Contractor shall recommend incorporating Risk Insurance Division personnel as Subject Matter Experts for education sessions to strategic audiences and NFIP and/ or Contractor staff as exhibitors. The Contractor shall fully delineate expected costs for attendance (including all costs for tradeshow participation) expected numbers of attendees for breakout sessions, expected amount of floor traffic, travel costs for Contractor staff and Risk Insurance Division staff and expected ROI. At the end of each conference/tradeshow, the Contractor will prepare and deliver a report of actual costs for participation, net effect of participation (how many attendees at sessions, how many visitors to booth) lessons learned, recommendations for future events, and any other similar types of insights.</p>
<p>Additional requirements included:</p>
<p>1. Overall Agent participation objectives include:</p>
<p>a. Increase the participation of agents in the agent referral program by 25% annually;</p>
<p>b. Analyze current flood insurance marketing efforts done by WYO companies and provide gap analysis report and recommendations to NFIP with 18 months of contract award;</p>
<p>c. Determine how WYO and Independent agents, and others within companies, receive information from the NFIP about important program changes, rates, underwriting, claims, etc. Research WYO interactions with agents, insurance companies, associations and others (to include high-volume and low-volume producers) and analyze data gathered to determine where gaps exist in information flow. Identify recommendations on where opportunities to positively impact the knowledge transfer process exist. Develop and deliver actionable information/plan within 12 months of contract award date to address those opportunities and present to FEMA for possible program enhancements;</p>
<p>2. Promotion of Flood Insurance importance objective:</p>
<p>Coordinate with appropriate FIMA divisions in communicating the importance of flood resiliency at the community, business and personal level, including the purchase of flood insurance.

<p>3. Perform Brand Management</p>
<p>Develop Brand Management Strategy by conducting opinion analysis of the NFIP among various audiences including policyholders and WYO agents as well as other stakeholders. Develop and deliver actionable recommendations, within 12 months of contract award, to enhance brand reputation across multiple sectors. Strategy should examine perceived value of flood insurance across multiple stakeholders, as well as threats to that value. Strategy should also take into consideration competition for policy sales, barriers to entry, and the ability of the NFIP to position itself in the market. Strategy should include specific recommendations for consideration on public/stakeholder interface with education/outreach efforts, claims process, underwriting process, cost of insurance, as well as other places where consumers/stakeholders interact with flood insurance process. Strategy should also include options on ways to implement plan across NFIP and all of its partners and stakeholders for consideration.</p>

For the Prime and each proposed consultant to be assigned to the team, list the larger current projects being designed in the firms' office. Indicate the firms' present workload and the availability of the project team (including sub-consultants) for the specified contract performance period.  Describe experience in successfully delivering projects per performance schedule, providing timely construction support, and successfully completing multiple projects with similar delivery dates.

4.	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Information will be obtained through the CPARS Government Past Performance Information System.    Contractors are required to provide three past performance questionnaires directly to the Contracting Officer (See attached form).  The contractor must provide the entire past performance questionnaire to each of its assessors.  An individual assessor knowledgeable of the contractor's quality of supplies and services rendered is requested to verify, complete the questionnaire, and submit to the Contracting Officer at dean.regazzi@va.gov.   If evaluating more than one contract for the same contractor, use a separate questionnaire for each contract being evaluated.

5.

9.	Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.  The SF 330 shall contain a signed and dated statement by the president of the firm affirming that that there are no records of significant claims because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

10.	Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team. Include any sub-contractors that are proposed.

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Requirement overview:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>NIST's Quantum Sensors' Group )QSG) develops detectors based on superconductivity that operate at low temperatures, ranging from 50mK to 4K. Cooling these detectors use specialized cryogenic cooling systems. Although there are commercial off-the-shelf cooling systems, these are typical very large and consume too much power for our detector systems. NIST is presently undertaking a development effort to miniaturize these cooling systems. As part of this effort, NIST is developing a compact cryocooler capable of reaching 1.5K for cooling Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors. This cooler consists of staging two separate cooling systems- a pulse tube for reaching 10K and a JT cooler for reaching 1K. For the purposes of this procurement, NIST is developing the pulse tube coldhead using a commercial Pressure Wave Generator.</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE:<br />The Boulder MicroFab is in need of a Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) tool to extend its capabilities to allow for reliable submicron Josephson junction fabrication, develop processes with more layers for complex circuits, and for improved values of maximum currents of superconducting wires in microcircuits. The tool needs to accommodate wafer sizes including 3, 4, and 6 inches in diameter, it needs to be compact in size and designed for R&amp;D and process development in contrast to tools designed for production featuring complex mechanisms for automated loading of wafers.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>1. Platen Section: Stainless Steel platen capable of receiving a carrier. Platen must rotate at speeds of up to 80 rpm with variable speed control.<br />2. Carrier Section: Carrier must be able to accept wafers from 76.5 mm (3 inch) to 150 mm (6 inch) with manual loading of wafers and size interchange fast and reliable for everyday users of the tool. There must be an adjustable force control up to 15 Kg force. The spindle containing the carrier must have a variable speed control of up to 80 rpm.<br />3. Conditioning: Must have the capability of varying the conditioning drive to speeds of up to 60 rpm.<br />4. Dimensions: Compact dimensions are preferred, table top capability or footprint less than 1.2 m2.<br />5. Control system: Must allow for control of basic operating parameters including polishing time, rotational speed, and carrier down force.<br />6. Slurry supply: One slurry pump is sufficient for the main purpose of polishing silicon oxide that will be given to this polisher. The use of a different slurry for research in new processes should be possible after proper rinsing of the pump and polisher.<br />7. DI water: Consumption must be a maximum of 10 L/min.</p>
<p>Any proprietary information should be so marked. The written capability statement should be received by the Contract Specialist no later than 11:00 pm MST January 23, 2015. The capability statement shall identify the business status of the organization.</p>
<p>Only electronic statements will be accepted. Faxes will not be accepted. Send to Contract Specialist Miguel Vasquez at Miguel.Vasquez@Nist.gov. Direct all questions to this e-mail no later than January 21, 2015 11:00AM MST.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The development of highly effective HIV prevention strategies, including a preventive vaccine and other non-vaccine biomedical prevention (nBP) products, remains one of the highest priorities for the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). With current global HIV infection estimates exceeding 33 million people, the development of safe, effective, and acceptable nBP products to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV could play a major role in the worldwide reduction of the estimated 5000 new HIV infections per day.</p>
<p>These services are currently being provided under two NIAID contracts entitled, "Non-human Primate Models to Evaluate Therapeutic Strategies and Topical Microbicides for HIV" (under Contract No. HHSN272200800020C with Advanced BioScience Laboratories) and "Comprehensive Resources for HIV Microbicides and Biomedical Prevention" (under Contract No. HHSN272201000001C with Advanced Bioscience Laboratories). However, the Government intends to consolidate these services into one requirement under one contract.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award multiple-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts in order to continue these support services. Task Orders will be issued in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Preclinical gap-filling services (Task Area A)<br />&bull; HIV animal models supporting product development (Task Area B)<br />&bull; Product manufacturing (Task Area C)<br />&bull; Scientific and quality/regulatory support services (Task Area D)</p>
<p>It is anticipated that NIAID will award base contract awards to multiple contractors for Task Areas A, B, and C; however, based on the need for centralized support services, NIAID anticipates awarding a base contract to a single contractor for Task Area D. In order to ensure the independence and objectivity required for the functions carried out under Task Area D, the contractor who is selected for the award of Task Area D will not be awarded a base contract for Task Areas A, B, and/or C. This includes both the prime contractor as well as any potential subcontractor.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of the proposed contract is to provide NIAID with preclinical product development services for candidate products that emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or from collaborations with outside companies or organizations. The scope of work encompasses preclinical activities that range from initial product discovery to those required to support clinical trials and/or product licensure. More specifically, these development services may be used to support a product at any point along the product development pathway, from discovery to IND, Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), and/or New Drug Application (NDA) filings with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). NIAID will primarily use this contract to more rapidly and efficiently fill critical development gaps and advance promising nBP products and MPTs into clinical testing. Although the focus of this contract will be development of nBP products, contract resources, at the discretion of NIAID, may be used to advance HIV vaccines, antivirals, or other HIV preventive or therapeutic strategies. Throughout this contract, these candidate products and/or strategies will collectively be referenced as "products."</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements<br /></strong>Offerors should have the qualifications, experience and capability to perform this requirement. The Contractor will carry out tasks in the following three areas:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. HIV Animal Models Supporting Product Development:</span></strong> Under this task area, the Contractor shall conduct pharmacokinetic (PK), safety, and efficacy studies in animal models of mucosal HIV/SIV/SHIV transmission in order to characterize promising products, inform dose selection, optimize formulations, and/or obtain other information necessary to advance or support product testing in subsequent animal or human studies. These models may include nonhuman primates (NHP), humanized mice, or other animal models of HIV infection or pathogenesis as they become available. When applicable, other activities (e.g., immunology, histopathology, etc.) as specified in the Task Order SOW shall be performed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. Product Manufacturing:</span></strong> Under this task area, the Contractor shall conduct the following types of activities: 1) Product manuafacturing and/or characterization to support both preclinical and clinical product indications.; and 2) Other specific activities in support of this task area as required by FDA to advance prducts into clinical testing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D. Scientific and Quality/Regulatory Support Services:</span></strong> Under this task area, the Contractor shall perform the following types of activities to advise and support the COR, other NIAID staff, and/or product sponsors, or support the general development of products through provision of resources to the HIV prevention field: 1) Provide additional expertise; 2) Develop and support programmatic meetings in specific regulatory requirements or other topics; 3) Provide Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) coordination support; 4) Conduct audits; 5) Prepare regulatory documentation; 6) Convene scientific groups related to non-vaccine biomedical prevention (nBP) products in support of this contract; and 7) Provide centralized storage for contract materials.</p>

Since that time, the array has been the centerpiece of an international climate study with nearly 70 surface buoys in the TAO array spanning the Pacific from approximately 8&deg;N to 8&deg;S from longitudes 137&deg;E to 95&deg;W. The moorings and data system have proven to be robust and reliable but have changed little from the original design, which was limited by the technology available at the time.<br /><br />NOAA requires these buoys to repair NDBC's Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean Array (TAO) of buoys in order to maintain NDBC's operational readiness and ability to maintain key stations within the TAO network. The current TAO network consists of 70 moorings in the Tropical Pacific Ocean, telemetering oceanographic and meteorological data to shore in real-time via the Argos satellite system. The array is a major component of the El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Observing System, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). Support is provided primarily by the United States (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and Japan (Japan Agency for Marine-earth Science and Technology) with additional contributions from France (Institute de recherch&eacute; pour le development).<br /><br />Capability Statement Objectives and Requirements: This request is issued for the purpose of exchanging information to improve the understanding of industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain these buoys, at reasonable cost and price, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.

<DESC>*ATTENTION: This is a Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice. It is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. Request for Information ? Representative Payee Site Reviews Comprehensive Program Support
The Social Security Administration (SSA) is performing market research to identify potential sources that have the availability and capability to provide planning, oversight, monitoring, and execution of the Representative Payee Expanded Monitoring Program. Your responses to the information requested will assist SSA in planning the appropriate acquisition strategy.
Purpose: The Social Security Administration (SSA) is exploring the possibility of a single vendor to provide all centralized administration and act as the principal provider in a major effort to enhance and consolidate the Representative Payee Monitoring program.
Background: Social Security benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments provide an important lifeline for millions of elderly and disabled Americans, survivors of deceased workers, and millions of young children. From the early days of our programs, Congress recognized that not all beneficiaries are able to manage their benefits. Therefore, in 1939, Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint representative payees (payee) to receive and manage benefits or payments on behalf of those beneficiaries or recipients. For more information on the Representative Payee Program, visit http://www.socialsecurity.gov/payee/index.htm.  We presume all legally competent adult beneficiaries or recipients are capable of managing or directing someone else to manage, the benefits or payments to which he or she is entitled. We prohibit the direct payment of benefits or payments to legally incompetent adult beneficiaries or recipients and to children under age 15. If we determine an adult beneficiary or recipient is not capable of managing or directing someone else to manage his or her benefits or payments, we select a representative payee for him or her.
Once we appoint a representative payee, we monitor and assess the performance of a payee. We look for indications that the payee is not performing his or her duties adequately. Often when we discover that a payee is performing poorly, we can help the payee correct the poor performance by re-educating the payee about his or her duties and responsibilities, including the need to keep adequate financial records. If appropriate, we will remove a poorly performing representative payee. 
With the exception of certain state mental institutions, all representative payees are required to submit an annual report accounting for the use of beneficiary or recipient funds. We review these reports and investigate those payees who provide questionable responses. 
In addition to the annual accounting process, we monitor representative payees? fiduciary performance through an on-site review process. Some of these reviews are required by statute, and others are discretionary. We conduct these reviews to determine whether payees are performing their payee duties and responsibilities satisfactorily, and complying with our rules. The reviews include examination of financial records and supporting documentation. 
Scope of Potential Requirement: The contractor would conduct and report their findings of the representative payee reviews.  The contractor would be required to conduct and report on more reviews incrementally, for the first three years of the contract.
The following outlines SSA?s anticipated implementation plan for the contractor, regarding the number of representative payee reviews to be conducted and reported on throughout the first three years of the contract:
Year 1 (Base) ? 1,000 Organizational Payees & 400 Individual Payees (1,400 total )
Year 2 (Option Year 1) ? 2,000 Organization Payees & 1,000 Individual Payees (3,000 total)
Year 3 (Option Year 2) ? 2,600 Organizational Payees, 1,270 Individual Payees, 780 Fee for Service (FFS) Payees, 50 State Mental Hospitals, 300 Quick Response Reviews (5,000 total)
The contractor would be responsible for providing the following services and be responsible for the following duties during a representative payee review:
?  Interview the payee about how they handle the beneficiary or recipients funds, how they determine a beneficiary or recipient?s needs, and any services they provide; ?  Review the payees banking procedures (including accounting system and bank account titling), financial records, and documentation of how they managed the sampled beneficiaries or recipients Social Security payments; ?  Conduct home visits for all beneficiaries or recipients selected for review as determined by SSA. For all other beneficiaries or recipients, conduct home visits for all beneficiaries or recipients selected in the review sample; ?  Interview the sample of beneficiaries to confirm information provided by the payee, verify large or unusual purchases noted during the financial review, ask if the payee is meeting his or her needs, and if there are any problems with the payee; ?  Refer suspected cases of abuse or neglect, health or safety, housing, or wage related issues to the appropriate agencies. The contractor must provide us with the date of the referral, the name of the referral agency, contact information for the agency, and any referral or allegation number, if provided by the agency; and ?  If the beneficiaries are in immediate danger, the contractor will contact the appropriate authorities and SSA immediately.
The contractor would also be responsible for the following:
?  Train payees on recordkeeping practices and money management when the payee has recordkeeping problems; ?  Send a closeout letter to the payee when the review has no deficiencies and provide a copy of the closeout letter to SSA; ?  Conduct  follow-up activities to ensure deficiencies, such as minor recordkeeping or bank account titling issues have been corrected; ?  Notify us about issues that affect program eligibility or payment amount; ?  Send a final report to us documenting the results of the review, resolved deficiencies, third-party referrals, and deficiencies requiring our action; and ?  If the contractor discovers potential misuse, the contractor will notify SSA and we will determine if the contractor should conduct a review of all beneficiary or recipients served by the payee during the suspected misuse period.
The contractor would also be responsible for reporting, tracking, and data collection:
?  SSA would  require the contractor to develop, manage, and maintain a secure web-based data collection system to collect and track the representative payee reviews; and/or ?  Have the ability to deliver encrypted electronic copies of the database and data collected as needed to SSA.

<DESC>This is an RFI to find out if there are any contractors able to perform the attached PWS.  
BACKGROUND: 
The Office of Rural Health's (ORH) mission is to improve access and quality of care for enrolled Veterans by developing evidence-based policies and innovative practices to support the unique health care needs of the nearly 3.2 million enrolled Veteran's (36% of the total enrolled Veterans) residing in rural and highly rural areas of the country.   The VA ORH was established in 2007, as mandated by Public Law 109-461, to conduct, coordinate, promote, and disseminate studies and analyses of issues affecting Veterans living in rural and highly rural areas.  ORH's strategic goals are to:
1.	Promote health and well-being in the rural Veteran population;
2.	Generate and diffuse knowledge regarding rural Veterans' health;
3.	Strengthen community health care infrastructure where rural Veterans reside; and
4.	Inform health care policy that impacts rural Veterans and rural health delivery.
While ORH has developed a robust communication network, its reach into the wider rural health care community is limited.  Two main reasons are that most VA health care facilities are located in urban areas and VA's entry into rural health care delivery issues and rural health policy is fairly recent.  
PURPOSE:
In order to more widely disseminate rural Veteran study results, share best practices in rural healthcare delivery, increase education and training for providers treating the unique conditions in rural Veterans, to better inform and shape policy initiatives relevant to rural Veterans, and further advance rural Veteran population health, ORH is looking for a contractor partner with a broad and deep reach into the larger rural health care community.  This partnership will help VHA increase awareness of rural Veterans' health issues and find solutions to address barriers to care in the wider rural health care community.
The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), except as may otherwise be specified.  The purpose of this PWS is to obtain contractor support to generate knowledge and widely disseminate results from projects, programs, and studies sponsored by ORH on rural Veterans, rural health policy and best practices in rural health care delivery.  The PWS is attached.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">This is NOT a request for quotes. There is no solicitation document available. This is a notice of intent of the United States Air Force at Beale AFB, CA to negotiate a sole source contract with Father Michael Kiernan for catholic priest services. Catholic Priest Services include those items described in the attached Performance Work Statement, dated 15 January 2015. All Catholic Priests must be attached to either a Religious Order or a Catholic Diocese. All priests that serve as Auxiliary Chaplains must do so with the endorsement of the Archdiocese for the Military Services (AMS) and only after being appointed to that particular location by the Catholic Diocese of Sacramento, which encompasses the region near and around Sacramento. The shortage of Catholic Chaplains has left numerous bases without the services of a Catholic Chaplain. This shortage of Catholic Chaplains prevents the AMS from providing an additional Catholic Chaplain for Beale AFB. The Catholic Diocese of Sacramento has assigned only one priest for service at Beale AFB.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This priest will receive the necessary endorsement from the AMS. Thus, the only source for a priest is the one appointed by the Catholic Diocese of Sacramento, therefore, a sole source Award is in the best interest of the Federal government. The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 and 13 procedures. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address shown below.</p>

<p>Navy CNIC N926, Child and Youth Programs (CYP), requires technical support for the management, requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, hosting, accreditation, and transition of the Department of Defense (DoD) Request for Care system, MilitaryChildCare.com (MCC).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MCC is a singular secure DoD web-based application that enables all DoD-eligible customers worldwide to request child care services for individual child and family needs. It is based on the MCC software baseline previously developed for CNIC and piloted in Hawaii at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam and Marine Corps Base Hawaii, in Nevada at Nellis Air Force Base (AFB), and in Florida at Naval Air Station (NAS) Key West.</p>
<p>MCC provides a single online gateway to military-operated or military-subsidized child and youth care options across all services for U.S. military families worldwide. It allows families to choose from a wide range of child care options, standardizes the placement process, and makes it easier for families to identify and request child care. As a result, families make more informed decisions about the care available, and placement occurs more quickly and efficiently regardless of the delivery system.</p>

(2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and?

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Apex Predators Program of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is requesting the charter of one (1) longline fishing vessel. The vessel will be involved in conducting sampling of large coastal sharks using bottom longline gear. Specific objectives of this survey are to: 1) investigate the distribution, abundance, and species composition of sharks; 2) collect catch per effort data; 3) tag sharks for migration studies; 4) inject, with tetracycline, tagged sharks whenever feasible for age validation studies; 5) collect biological samples for age and growth, food habits and reproductive studies; and to 6) collect morphometric data in accordance with the attached SOW.</p>
<p>The planned period of performance is up to 50 days, April 4 through May 22, 2015. We expect to conduct the survey in two (2) legs of three (3) weeks duration. A shorter leg may also be required in the event we substitute scientific personnel. Depending on where the ship departs, the vessel may be required to enter port to pick up the scientific crew before the fishing starts and in between legs. Flexibility will be required on the vessel's part.</p>
<p>This is a best value, competitive requirement. The Government expects to award a firm-fixed-price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced quoter with the highest technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The following factors, which are listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Vessel characteristics and configuration, particulars and general arrangement (preferably with<br />photos of deck configuration, berthing arrangement and wheelhouse electronics).</p>
<p>(2) Vessel's commercial fishing history and any other information important in evaluating the<br />vessel's fishing capability.</p>
<p>(3) Master's and crew's work experience and qualifications including copies of licenses held and<br />emergency medical qualifications and descriptions of research qualifications and past research<br />performed.</p>
<p>(4) Past Performance - Identify vessel, master's and crews past performance experience. Quoters<br />shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state no relevant past performance.</p>
<p>(5) Price.</p>
<p>Factors 1-4, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be competed as a 100% total small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification Code System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development, Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2014)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Mandatory Electronic Invoicing 
VA published the final rule requiring vendors to submit invoices electronically to the Financial Services Center (FSC) in the November 27, 2012 Federal Register.  The rule became effective December 27, 2012.  The rule includes a new contract clause to be inserted in all solicitations and contracts by the contracting officer (VAAR 852.232-72).  Vendors can comply with the rule by using either of the two methods below:
1.        The FSC uses a third-party contractor, OB10, to transition vendors from paper to electronic invoice submission.  For information on OB10 electronic invoicing set-up, vendors should call 877-752-0900, or email USClientServices@ob10.com .
2.        A system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) format established by the Accredited Standards Center.  For FSC e-Invoicing information, please call 877-353-9791 or email vafsccshd@va.gov.
FSC and VA's Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction (OALC) will assist existing commercial vendors in migrating to the electronic process.  Until the transition to electronic format is complete, FSC will continue to process paper invoices for commercial vendors. 
The FSC's electronic invoicing system provides a variety of flexible solutions for all vendor types, including small businesses, and does not require any vendor transaction fees.  More information on the FSC electronic invoicing process can be found at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.Contracting Office Address:

Each panel has an alarm audible acknowledge button to clear whatever audible alarm condition is present. <br>  <br> Vendors responding should be prepared to provide a solution to the specified areas: <br>  <br>  <br>  	 Automated, real time indication of contents of all thirty-(30) tanks    simultaneously displayed on Control Room screen/screens in the same location as that vacated by existing meter panels.  <br>  	High and Low level alarm functions for each tank. <br>  	Audible and visual alarm annunciation, clearly indicating alarm situation and tank involved. <br>  	Ability to acknowledge audible and visual alarms separately, but if the alarm condition self clears, the audible and visual alarm will not clear until acknowledged.   <br>  	Ability to program and set alarm time delay, individually for each tank so as to account for nuisance tripping during swash conditions around alarm set point. <br>  	System components should be industry standard, as 'commercial off the shelf' as possible in order to increase maintainability of the system.  Replacement components should be easily obtainable. <br>  	After Contract award and completion of system installation all plans, drawings, operating manuals and component cut sheets shall be deliverables of the Contract.  Three-(3) copies of each shall be furnished. <br>  	List of recommended spare parts should accompany Design documentation. <br>  	System shall be fully tested to the satisfaction of the Government (Due to the fact that entry into the tanks will not be available, the Government will accept +/- 5% as compared to current tank soundings).  Ship's force can assist in transferring tank contents to facilitate testing, but other testing (alarm features) may require the Contractor to simulate conditions in order to verify proper system operation. <br>  	Provisions for training the Ship's crew in all aspects of System operation & programming, to include troubleshooting for repair, shall be provided as part of Contract Award. <br>

Ombudsman Notice

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Offeror shall provide in its quote a minimum of three past performance references demonstrating performance of work similar in type and scope to that described in the SOW. Offeror is requested to forward the Past Performance Questionnaire found in Attachment C attached hereto to these references for prompt completion and return to the Contract Specialist of this solicitation.

The submittal shall include rationale how it was determined that the work performed previously was the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the work specified in the RFQ. Non-government contracts may be used if government contracts are not available. The documentation shall be submitted in the following format:<br />o Contract Number, Award Date and Contract Type.<br />o Price - Original Award and Final (or projected final, if contract is current).<br />o Delivery Schedule - Original and Final (or projected final, if contract is current). <br />o Address and telephone number of government agency or component including:<br />&bull; Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO)<br />&bull; Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO)<br />&bull; Contracting Officer Representative (COR)<br />o Non-governmental contracts - Point of contact, name address, telephone number and email address if available.<br />o Identify in detail for each contract listed, why or how the effort is relevant to the effort required in this RFQ. In determining relevancy, consideration should be given but not limited to such things as product/service similarity, size, complexity, contract type.<br />o A narrative explanation on each contract listed must describe objectives achieved and data regarding technical performance, quality, schedule delays, price/cost control, and a brief explanation of the reasons for shortcomings, if any, and corrective actions taken to avoid recurrence. <br />o A copy of any cure notices or show-cause letters received on each contract listed and a description of any corrective action by the Offeror. <br />o A list of each time the delivery schedule was revised and provides an explanation why the revision was necessary.</p>
<p>(iii) Offerors are reminded that both independent third party data and data provided by Offeror may be used by the Government to evaluate Offeror past performance. However, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance as requested remains with the Offeror. Further, Offerors submitting quotes without requested information risk rejection by the Government. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, the Offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating.</p>
<p>Assessments of technical acceptability and past performance will be made and will be rated pursuant to the adjectival rating categories as described in the tables below:</p>
<p>Table 1. Rating System for Technical Acceptability<br /><br />Rating Definition<br />Acceptable Meets all RFQ requirements. The Contractor is technically acceptable, accepting all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements.<br />Unacceptable Contractor fails to meet one or more RFQ requirements and is removed from award consideration.</p>
<p>Table 2. Rating System for Past Performance</p>
<p>Rating Definition<br />Acceptable Based on the Offeror's past performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Unacceptable Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />Neutral If an Offeror has no recent or relevant past performance information available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will be rated Neutral.</p>
<p><br />3. Price: The contractor shall acknowledge any amendments to the Request for Quote, if applicable, at the beginning of this section.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing as requested in the attached spreadsheet titled Attachment B, Schedule of Repair Pricing. Any price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. The Offeror's quote will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 13.106-3 in order to determine if it is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items. Consideration shall be given to the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate contracts. Therefore, for purposes of evaluating whether multiple awards will result in the lowest overall cost for the Government, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a contract is $1000.</p>

<p>An Offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />GENERAL GUIDANCE<br />Please use the following ratings to score the performance elements below (assessments should reflect only contractor-liable performance):<br />RATING DESCRIPTION<br />Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to your organization's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.<br />Very Good Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to your organization's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.<br />Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.<br />Marginal Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the evaluation area being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented<br />Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the evaluation area being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.</p>
<p>EVALUATION: Rate the contractor in each of the following Evaluation Areas.<br />Quality of Product or Service. Assess the contractor's conformance to contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., specified technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). List and assess any sub-elements to indicate different efforts where appropriate. For example: Are reports/data accurate? Does the service provided meet the specifications of the contract? Does the contractor's work measure up to commonly accepted technical or professional standards? Assess the degree of direction given by your organization to solve problems that arise during performance.</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />B. Schedule. Assess the timeliness of the contractor against the completion of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). This assessment of the contractor's adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the contractor's efforts during the assessment period that contributes to or effect the schedule variance. This element applies to contract closeout activities as well as contract performance. Instances of adverse actions such as the assessment of liquidated damages, or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract schedule and should therefore be noted in the evaluation.</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Cost Control. Assess the contractor's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract cost. For example, does the contractor keep within the total estimated cost (what is the relationship of the negotiated costs and budgeted costs to actual)? Did the contractor do anything innovative that resulted in cost savings? Were billings current, accurate and complete? Are the contractor's budgetary internal controls adequate?</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Business Relations. Assess the integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification and resolution of issues in controversy), and customer satisfaction. Is the contractor oriented toward the customer? Is interaction between the contractor and your organization satisfactory, or does it need improvement? Also, in making the assessment, include the adequacy of the contractor's accounting, billing, and estimating systems; and the contractor's management of, if a substantial amount of property has been provided to the contractor under the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Management of Key Personnel. Assess the contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. For example, how well did the contractor match the qualifications of the key position, as described in the contract, with the person who filled the key position? Did the contractor support key personnel so they were able to work effectively? If a key person did not perform well, what action was taken by the contractor to correct this? If a replacement of a key person was necessary, did the replacement meet or exceed the qualifications of the position as described in the contract schedule?<br />RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUMMARY<br />Would your organization/company award another contract to this Contractor (or use the services of the Contractor again)? 0 Yes / 0 No <br />In summary, if you care to, please give your overall assessment of this Contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any additional comments to add?</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) Please note, this procurement falls under FAR 13.  While the solicitation may use terms that are conceptually similar to those in FAR 15, such terms may not have the same meaning in this case (such as strength, weakness, deficiency, etc.).
(b) The Government may award multiple contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation shall be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  However, no more than one contract shall be awarded per geographic location.  The VA, in its tradeoff, may consider the relative benefits and detriments of awarding a single contract to one Offeror for multiple regions versus multiple small awards (one for each region) to separate Offerors. The following factors, in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:
(1) Technical Approach with respect to the following elements (please note, while these are areas of importance, they are not sub-factors and shall not be rated individually).  These elements are considered to be of equal importance.  Technical Approach shall be evaluated using the scheme described below, and an Offeror shall receive an "acceptable" or better on Technical Approach to be considered for award:
(a)	Ability to meet Joint Commission standards
(b)	Ability to meet timeliness, patient training, and documentation requirements

Good	Offer meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.
Acceptable	Offer meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.  Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate.
Marginal	Offer does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.  The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.
Unacceptable	Offer does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies.  Offer is not awardable.


(2)	Technical Capability with respect to the following elements (please note, while these are areas of importance, they are not sub-factors and shall not be rated individually).

	(a)	Past Relevant Experience
	(b)	Qualifications of Offeror's Management Team and Direct Service Staff
 (c)	The follow table illustrates the rating scheme for this factor:

Rating
Parameter	Description
Outstanding	Offer meets requirements and indicates an exceptional capability and understanding of the requirements.  Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.

Unacceptable	Offer does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies.  Offer is not awardable.


(3)	Past Performance shall be evaluated to its relevance and confidence using the following scheme.  Please note, an Offeror must receive a rating of "substantial confidence," "confidence," or "unknown/neutral confidence" in order to be eligible for award:

First, past performance shall be evaluated to its relevance, defined as the following ratings.

Rating
Parameter	Description
Relevant	Past performance effort involved at least a similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.
Not Relevant	Past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

Only relevant past performance efforts will be rated as to confidence, as defined by the following ratings:
Rating
Parameter	Description
Substantial Confidence	Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror shall successfully perform the required effort.
Confidence	Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror shall successfully perform the required effort.
Limited Confidence	Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectation that the Offeror shall be able to successfully perform the required effort.
No Confidence	Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectations that the Offeror shall be able to successfully perform the required effort.
Unknown/Neutral Confidence	No recent/relevant performance record is available or the Offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

Price/Cost shall also be evaluated.
Award shall be made on a trade-off basis.  Non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  
(c) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(e) Award Based on Initial Offers:

The Government intends to make award without discussions.  Accordingly, Offerors are encouraged to submit their initial offers based upon most favorable terms, prices, technical and other factors.  The Department of Veterans Affairs may make contract award without further dialog with Offerors regarding this solicitation.  However, the Government reserves the right to eliminate all Offerors, except those with the most realistic chance of receiving the ultimate award, for any or all locations-based on evaluation of the factors above or to allow for efficient evaluation.  The decision to eliminate Offerors and hold additional dialog is solely within the Government's discretion.

Vendors must acknowledge all amendments with their proposal submission.  <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br>  <br> Solicitation W52P1J-15-T-KP10 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-76. This request for quotation is issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5.  <br>  <br> The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334220-Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 750 employees. This acquisition is being procured under full and open competition.  <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:  <br>  <br> This requirement is to procure subscriber units that are fully operational with a Smartnet Type II Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system manufactured by Motorola. The requirement is for end users at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama (RSA) who are currently operating on the Smartnet Type II system. Each portable subscriber unit shall be fully operational to include, at a minimum, programming, battery (conditioned), antenna, and belt clip. Mobiles and Desktops must be delivered and installed in accordance with (IAW) the Customer Requirements Statement (CRS.) Mobile and desktop subscriber units shall be installed in accordance with commercial standards.  <br>  <br> A Pre-proposal Site Survey is scheduled to take place from 06 January to 16 January 2015 at the Redstone Arsenal, Network Enterprise Center (NEC-R), BLDG 3400. Please contact Mr. Dean Allen, Mr. Rickie Green and Mr. Neal Dedicatoria by 19 December 2014 to request a date and time (date availability will be on a first come first serve basis, see contact information below.) Redstone will be conducting a Land Mobile Radio compatibility test as part of the Site Survey. The purpose of this compatibility test is for potential LMR Offerors and Manufacturers who are interested in providing a quote on this RFQ to test and verify that their equipment is compatible with Redstone's existing LMR system (Smartnet Type II LMR system manufactured by Motorola).  <br>  <br> This will be the Offeror's pre-proposal opportunity to evaluate and examine everything required to address the requirements of the CRS and have the Government technical team provide clarification of any requirements the Offeror thinks need clarified.  <br>  <br> Potential Offeror's are encouraged and advised to use the time between the RFQ posting and the Pre-proposal Site Survey to familiarize themselves with the requirements of the CRS and develop any questions they may have. Participation is limited to four (4) individuals per Offeror. All visitors must successfully pass a criminal records check. Visitors must complete the quote mark MAX Access Template (Visit Request Form) quote mark and submit it to the NEC-R POCs (via email at dean.e.allen8.civ@mail.mil and rickie.l.green.civ@mail.mil) and the PD LMR Project Lead (via email at neal.h.dedicatoria2.civ@mail.mil) by 19 December 2014.  <br>  <br> Potential Offerors entering Redstone Arsenal will need the following items for entry: a Driver's License and Rental Car Agreement.

<DESC><p><br />Listed below are answers to questions asked about solicitation NHRC-Windows-Carpet-Floor-Cleaning-2015. You may update your proposals and return them by January 23, 2015 1300PST for consideration.</p>
<p>1. Can you let me know how will the work be acquired? Is it simplified acquisition? Or other acquisition type? Performance-based or time and material? Is this considered a commercial buy? Off the Shelf type? <br />This will be a simplified acquisition.</p>
<p>2. Are we bidding as a proposal or is this a quote? <br />Please submit a proposal.</p>
<p>3. We are used to putting our quote or proposals on a SF 1449 - are you going to be issuing that form for submission? <br />We will not be issuing the SF 1449. The SF1449 is available on the GSA Forms Library.</p>
<p>4. I know that this is a government contract and would like to know if this requirement is free from the US DOL Labor and Wage Determination? If not, can you please provide the DOL Wage Determination? It helps on gov't contracts to level the playing field.<br />Wage determination for California County of San Diego be found on form WD<br />05-2057 (Rev.-16), posted on www.wdol.gov.</p>
<p>5. There were no written instructions on how you want the proposal formatted for pricing? Because this will take some time to complete the window job and it is being required 4x a year do you prefer we submit our pricing on a unit basis. It will be necessary to estimate the number of hours workers will be working and shift differentials. <br />Please submit pricing on a unit basis.</p>
<p>6. Also, can you also let me know if I will be required to pay H&amp;W according to the DOL rate?<br />H&amp;W will be according to the DOL rate.</p>
<p>7. Will overtime be allowed on this contract.<br />No.</p>
<p>8. What is the evaluation Criteria the government intends to use.<br />There will be a technical evaluation for each proposal.</p>
<p>9. Under "specific requirements" - the gov't list different types of building that total 19. The chart clearly includes 21 buildings? Can the gov't give the number of the buildings added?<br />The count for buildings with carpets to be cleaned is 19. The count for buildings with flooring to be cleaned is 22. The total count of buildings is 22 (building numbers 62, 74, 304, 308, 309, 310, 313, 314, 315, 320, 322, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 335, 337, 346 and 347).</p>
<p>10. Can you provide the square footage of buildings 320 and buildings 328 to do a proper analysis.<br />Building 320 is approximately 14,000 square feet. Building 328 is approximately 13,800 square feet.</p>
<p>11. Under laminate - M-F the hours state the work will be completed from 0700 to 1600. Will this time conflict with incumbent janitors?<br />It will not conflict. A cleaning schedule will be established after the award is issued.</p>
<p>12. In the statement of work under the "linoleum flooring" - it states that the vendor shall perform during normal operating hours of 0900-1800, Monday thru Friday? It seems a little confusing as to the times when the work will be done. Weekends are the best time to do floors because it increases safety? Will the gov't allow the floor work to be done on weekends?<br />A cleaning schedule will be established after the award is issued, every other Friday there are buildings cleared of personnel and can be cleaned. Normal operating hours should be 0700-1600.</p>
<p>13. It was stated that "extraction" is the preferred method of cleaning - but under the CRI for the type of carpet that is in these buildings it seems that "bonnet" or "dry-chem" cleaning will be the best solution. Extraction utilizes an excessive amount of water and takes the longest to dry. Upon inspection of the floors/carpets, it was noted that there isn't any padding under the carpet and it is glued on? Extraction certainly has the potential to damage the underside of the carpet and wash away the glue; or at a minimum reduce it's effectiveness. Will the gov't allow "bonnet" or "other dry cleaning" methodology for carpet cleaning? If not, will the gov't hold the contractor harmless if the glue comes up after extracting the "indoor/outdoor" carpet glued to the floor?<br />Bonnet or dry cleaning methodology is acceptable; please state which will be used and reason.</p>
<p>14. Do the current janitorial contract include cleaning floors and will there be any overlap, or will this requirement be strictly weekend project type work?<br />There is no current cleaning contract and there will be no overlap.</p>
<p>15. In the SOW the requirement states that "the vendor shall perform during normal operating hours of 0900 - 1800 can you clarify what specific work will done during those hours?<br />All cleaning requirements will be scheduled between normal operating hours.<br />NHRC will schedule that building be cleared prior to cleaning. Normal operating hours should be 0700-1600.</p>
<p>16. Is the government requesting a full-time person five days a week to do the floor work?<br />Floor cleaning is required once per quarter according to the requirements.</p>
<p>17. Can the gov't provide the specifications for all the different types of floors?<br />NHRC has carpet, linoleum and laminate flooring.</p>
<p>18. The requirement states that the windows are 2 1/2 - 4 1/2 as an average size but upon inspections the windows are larger than that. Is this a estimate on the gov't part and can we quote based on actual sizes of windows?<br />The window sizes are an average size provided by the government. You may quote based on your window measurements provided that your measurements are included.</p>
<p>19. In the requirement the gov't list that vendors will be responsible for screens that are damaged? Can the gov't provide the cost of average screen in order that we may estimate accurately?<br />Aluminum window screen replacement options are commercially available between $10 and $50.</p>
<p>20. In the requirement it states that the contractor must provide a detailed proposal/plan prior to the start of the work? Will the gov't evaluate on plan and if so, is that plan required in our response.<br />There will be a technical evaluation for each proposal, a plan will be required.</p>
<p>21. Can the gov't provide an email address for proposal submission?<br />jerry.blanco@med.navy.mil is listed as the primary point of contact please submit proposals to that address.</p>
<p>22. Due to the short timeframe from site visit can the gov't extend the submission for one week to prepare properly?<br />Deadline to submit final proposal January 23,2015 1300PST</p>
<p>23. The SOW states that the floors will be done 2x per period of performance and on the chart provided it states that the floors will be done quarterly (4X). Can the gov't please clarify?<br />Carpeted flooring will be cleaned semi-annually or twice during the period of performance. Linoleum and laminate flooring will be cleaned quarterly or four times during the period of performance.</p>
<p>24. Can the government provide the square footage for laminate and linoleum?<br />Approximately 50,000sqft for the linoleum flooring, which leaves 25,000sqft as laminate.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 120 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 120 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition.  Evaluation Factors: SEE SECTION L & M INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS. <BR> <BR>The period of performance shall be for 120 days from award of contract for delivery, installation, inspection and acceptance. <BR> <BR>

(The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).) (1) Listed end products. Listed End Product: _______________ Listed Countries of Origin: _______________ (2) Certification. (If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.) <BR> <BR>__ (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. __ (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <BR> <BR>(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

This will be submitted to the Contracting Officer. If there are any ratings other than green a copy will be furnished to the contractor.     <br>    The COR may submit a Quality Assurance Worksheet at anytime and as often as necessary to document quality levels.  If Contractor response to an identified quality deficiency is unsatisfactory, the Contracting Officer will contact the appropriate Contractor representative to implement a plan of action to remedy the identified deficiency    <br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Boulder MicroFab is in need of a Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) tool to extend its capabilities to allow for reliable submicron Josephson junction fabrication, develop processes with more layers for complex circuits, and for improved values of maximum currents of superconducting wires in microcircuits. The tool needs to accommodate wafer sizes including 3, 4, and 6 inches in diameter; it needs to be compact in size and designed for R&amp;D and process development in contrast to tools designed for production featuring complex mechanisms for automated loading of wafers. </span></p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS&nbsp;<br /><br />The evaluation factors below are not formal source selection procedures.</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award: Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA), responsive and responsible Offeror. This is a competitive LPTA selection in which technical acceptability is considered the most important factor. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offers, with satisfactory past performance, shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award of this effort. For the purpose of award, the government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 2 - Past Performance (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 3 - Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Acceptability<br />In order to be determined technically acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate capability to meet the following standards:</p>
<p>1. The offeror shall submit their Technical Capability Information as Volume I, and be no more than 3 pages.</p>
<p>2. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach to accomplish assembly in accordance with MIL-A-8625 and MIL-STD-130 as required by the technical drawings.</p>
<p>3. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach, including tools and equipment required to perform assembly of the ATDC Frames. Specifically, the offeror shall provide the following information: Tool Name, Manufacturer, Part Number, and a brief description of how the tool will be used during the assembly process. The technical approach will be evaluated for:</p>
<p>a. Compliance with Drawing 8554696.<br />b. Compliance with the requirements in the SOW.<br />c. Compliance with delivery schedule as detailed in the SOW.</p>
<p>4. The offeror's technical proposal shall enable Government evaluating personnel to make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the proposal will meet the requirements of the Statement of Work. Each technical proposal shall be specific, detailed, and complete as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the prospective contractor has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the Statement of Work requirements. Proposals that paraphrase the specifications / Statement of Work or attest that "standard procedures will be employed" are inadequate to demonstrate how the proposal complies with the Statement of Work and will render the proposal "Unacceptable".</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors must not have unsatisfactory past performance. The Offeror shall not submit performance data for this factor. The government may seek relevant performance information on all responsive and otherwise Technically Acceptable Offerors through sources such as DCMA, CPARS, FAPIIS, or PPIRS; or other government databases and other available sources. The government shall not be limited in its search for performance data. When past performance is evaluated, the outcome is satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory performance will disqualify an Offeror from award. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, the Offeror shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance; however, the offeror would be rated neutral. Satisfactory and Neutral are determined to be passing.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price Evaluation<br />The government shall conduct a price evaluation of all technically acceptable offers with satisfactory or neutral past performance.</p>
<p>b. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>c. Selection Decision:<br />The government shall select the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsive, and responsible offer for award.</p>
<p>All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation. For changes made after the closing date, only those Offerors that provide a quote will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.<br />To be eligible for award of a Government contract, contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). The link to the website is https://www.sam.gov.<br />No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed. Quotes must be submitted in portable document format (.pdf) by email to the Primary Point of Contact (POC) identified below. It is the responsibility of the Offeror to submit offers to the POC at NSWC PHD by the closing date of January 21, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-91)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />Email: OPAP@uscg.mil<br />Fax: 202-372-8447<br />Phone: 202-475-5786<br /><br />More information about the Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/acquisition/business/ombudsman.asp<br /><br />Alternative Point of Contact: <br />Crystal Taber, Contracting Officer<br />USCG, ALC<br />Email: crystal.g.taber@uscg.mil<br />Fax: 252-334-5242<br />Phone: 252-335-6895</p>

<p>(3) The certification may be executed by any person authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.</p>
<p>(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.

<p>(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C. chapter 71.</p>
<p>(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR).

<p>With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.</p>
<p>(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>The formal Request for Proposal (RFP)&nbsp;for CFT has been posted to FBO. There are 21 attachments to the RFP.</p>
<p>Some of the content contained within the RFP (and its attachments) is different than what was provided during the Q&amp;A process. All documents have been updated and/or revised since the Q&amp;A phase. Offerors are suggested to consider the Q&amp;A as a guide only; the formal RFP (and its attachments) supersedes all previous postings. Offerors need to carefully review the RFP (and its attachments) for the applicable due dates and&nbsp;instructions for submitting proposals.<br />__________________________________________________________</p>
<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Previously Posted Information<br /><br /></span></strong></span></span>
<p>9 Oct 14 - FORMAL SYNOPSIS - Contract Field Teams (CFT)<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong></span></span><br />This announcement constitutes a Formal Synopsis for the Contract Field Teams (CFT) program located at Tinker AFB.</p>
<p>The Government seeks to award approximately 13 Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts in two (2) competition pools:</p>
<p>(1) Full and Open competition pool: Approximately six (6) ID/IQ contracts to either Small or Large Businesses competing in the Full and Open competition pool whose offers represent the best value to the Government. <br />(2) Small Business Set-Aside competition pool: Approximately seven (7) ID/IQ contracts to Small Businesses competing in the Small Business Set-Aside competition pool whose offers represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Note: Offerors competing in the Small Business Set-Aside competition pool may elect to compete in the Full and Open competition pool. Small Businesses will be evaluated in the appropriate competition pool(s) based on the offeror's selection located on the front page of the formal RFP (when released).</p>
<p>The Air Force will acquire this requirement through an Air Force Source Selection.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the resultant contracts will be FAR Part 15 ID/IQ contracts with Firm Fixed Price, Time &amp; Material, and Cost-Reimbursable line items. This is a non-commercial acquisition.</p>
<p>The contract ordering period will consist of a maximum seven years and six months. The basic period will be three-years (ends year 3), Option I will be two-years (ends year 5), and Option II will be two-years (ends year 7). The options will be priced at the time of contract award. At the end of any contract period, FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, allows for continued services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. This clause will be incorporated and evaluated at the time of basic contract award. The solicitation and contract will expressly state that the clause at 52.217-8 may be used for additional ordering period (up to six months) at the end of any contract period and that the NTE rates specified in the contract for the ordering period existing at the time 52.217-8 is exercised will apply to the task orders issued during the new ordering period under the Option to Extend Services. Each task order will state a period of performance for the services ordered and may include clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, so long as it is incorporated and evaluated at the time the task order is issued.</p>
<p>This is a partial Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS Code 336411.</p>
<p>The Line Item Description will be as follows:<br />X001 - Firm Fixed Price (FFP) <br />X002 - Overtime in support of FFP (FP) <br />X003 - Surge (FP) <br />X004 - Over and Above (FFP)<br />X005 - CAP/CAS (CR)<br />X006 - Time and Materials (T&amp;M)<br />X007 - Overtime in support of T&amp;M (T&amp;M)<br />X008 - Material/Non-Material (T&amp;M)<br />X009 - Travel (CR)<br />X010 - Transition In (FFP)<br />X011 - Transition Out (FFP)<br />X012 - Data (NSP)<br />X013 - Post Award Conference (CR)</p>
<p>Deliveries and locations will be cited on individual task orders. FOB Origin and Destination.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to establish a competitive, performance based service acquisition (PBSA) for Contract Field Team (CFT) support. CFTs are available for use by all the Department of Defense (DoD) services and other federal agencies. A CFT is an awarded set of Contractor maintenance personnel who are provided with Government-furnished special tools, equipment, work space and supplies to accomplish modification/maintenance/repair effort on-site at operational Government locations, both in the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). The CFT program accomplishes depot, field and organizational level inspection, maintenance, modification and repair at operational Government locations worldwide. The program supports requirements for the active Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve components. CFT contracts are also used to support requirements generated by the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies. The CFT program provides a rapid deployment workforce augmentation capability to field necessary skilled technicians on site anywhere in the world to support the Government's war readiness needs.</p>
<p>All award eligibility requirements will be stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation through FedBizOps at http://www.fbo.gov. Solicitation requests can be submitted to Wade Ward via email at bradley.ward.3@us.af.mil and Melony Adamski at melony.adamski.1@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 405-736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />___________________________________________________________<br /><br />Previously Posted Information<br /><br /></span></strong>2 Jul 14 - Follow-up Q&amp;A<br /><br />Attached is the follow-up Q&amp;A derived from the original Q&amp;A posted on 29 May 14.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)  <br>    <br>  Surviving Blood Loss (SBL) Program  <br>    <br>  SYNOPSIS  <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201e. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The Government will NOT pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is no way obligated by the information received. This notice is for market research purposes only to obtain information regarding (1) the availability and capability of all qualified performer sources, (2) including small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; small disadvantaged businesses; and universities and educational institutions, (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for the proposed acquisition. The applicable NAICS Code is 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method to conduct clinical trials for the development of an FDA-approved, infusion therapy to treat patients with severe hemorrhage as experienced during combat. In accordance with current FDA recommendations, early clinical trials should: study the safety profile of the therapeutic; study the optimal starting dose and dosing schedule for the product; and identify and study the potential biological activities to provide scientific data on which to base further product development.  <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND  <br>    <br>  Severe hemorrhage continues to be the leading cause of US deaths in combat. In collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), the Defense Health Program Joint Program Committee Six (JPC-6) has a requirement to develop novel strategies to radically extend the time that an injured warfighter can survive critical blood loss on the battlefield before surgery. Whereas conventional resuscitation methods require a significant amount of blood and plasma products that are typically unavailable at the battlefield point-of-injury (with standard intravenous fluids being an inadequate blood substitute that worsen a patient's condition), DARPA and JPC-6 researchers have identified a low-volume, water soluble model - 17 -ethynylestradiol-3-sulfate, sodium salt (EE-3-SO4) - which may help to mitigate the effects of hemorrhage at the cellular level and prevent or reverse the onset of hemorrhagic shock, thereby exponentially increasing the survivability of the patient. The concept moving forward is that EE-3-SO4 may be deployed as a field expedient solution that can be administered to severely injured warfighters in the prehospital environment. JPC-6 therefore seeks full solution clinical research support to guide EE-3-SO4 through FDA IND submission and GCP compliant Phase 1 and 2a clinical trials for an indication as a viable infusion therapy for the treatment of critical patients with significant blood loss. Support may also be required to conduct additional preclinical work as required to facilitate either the Phase 1 or Phase 2a clinical trials.  The anticipated period of performance is 36 months, although this is subject to change given the variable nature of FDA submissions.  <br>    <br>  OBJECTIVES  <br>    <br>  The objective of issuing this RFI is to gather information that will assist in the determination of a suitable acquisition solution for conducting a clinical trial for patients with significant blood loss as experienced in combat. In accordance with current FDA recommendations, the clinical trials supported through this acquisition should study the safety profile of the therapeutic; study the optimal starting dose and dosing schedule for the product; and identify and study the potential biological activities to provide scientific data on which to base further product development.    <br>    <br>  Interested parties should provide detailed responses and/or materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ANY OR ALL of the inquiries listed below:   <br>    <br>  1.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)  <br>    <br>  Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) as a Field Expedient System for Patients with Severe Torso Hemorrhage  <br>    <br>  SYNOPSIS  <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201e. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The Government will NOT pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is no way obligated by the information received. This notice is for market research purposes only to obtain information regarding (1) the availability and capability of all qualified performer sources, (2) including small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; small disadvantaged businesses; and universities and educational institutions, (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for the proposed acquisition. The applicable NAICS Code is 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method for the advanced development of a field deployable, rescuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) system as a FDA-approved indication for the treatment of trauma-related severe hemorrhage.    <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND  <br>    <br>  Severe hemorrhage, particularly non-compressible torso and junctional hemorrhage, continues to be the leading cause of US deaths in combat. The US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Joint Program Committee Six (JPC-6) has a requirement to develop novel strategies to control severe hemorrhage on the battlefield.  Recent advancements in endovascular technology have led JPC-6 researchers to reexamine the effectiveness of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) as a technique for controlling torso hemorrhage in austere combat environments and as an alternative to less field-expedient techniques such as thoracotomy and aortic cross clamping.  JPC-6 therefore seeks Phase I-III clinical research support for the advanced development of a FDA-approved, trauma-specific indication for REBOA in a field deployable system.  Although REBOA is currently performed utilizing existing catheters and commercial off-the-shelf products, the Government seeks a new device with particular military specifications and label indication for trauma that will allow for better operational adaptability and use in austere environments.  The anticipated period of performance is 36 months, although this is subject to change given the variable nature of FDA submissions.    <br>    <br>  OBJECTIVES  <br>    <br>  The objective of issuing this RFI is to gather information that will assist in the determination of a suitable acquisition solution for conducting a GCP compliant clinical trial in the development of a FDA-approved, trauma-specific REBOA system for the treatment of severe hemorrhage - especially non-compressible torso and junctional hemorrhage - as experienced during combat.  It is anticipated that this will be a full solution effort, spanning from final engineering, FDA submission preparation, and clinical trials to FDA approval and development of production capabilities.  Interested parties should provide detailed responses and/or materials related to their technical capabilities to fulfill the potential Government requirement.  <br>    <br>  The REBOA system shall be designed to control hemorrhage from non-compressible injuries while maintaining vital blood pressure and circulation to the brain and heart.  Whereas current REBOA techniques rely on existing catheters and commercial off-the-shelf products and limit military use, the Government requires a new, field deployable device that is indicated for use in trauma and has potential for point-of-injury care in austere combat environments.  Specific device criteria include:   <br>    <br>   	Fluoroscopy-independent placement of balloon catheter.  <br>   	Minimization of time needed to place catheter.  <br>   	Low-profile/small sheath size.  <br>   	Integrated arterial pressure monitoring, allowing operator to monitor blood pressure above and below the balloon.  <br>   	Minimization of device weight and volume.  <br>   	Safeguards against balloon overinflation and inadvertent vessel perforation.  <br>   	Ruggedization of device to withstand field conditions and maximize protection against patient infection.    <br>    <br>  Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ANY OR ALL of the inquiries listed above. Respondents should provide responses whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm.   <br>    <br>  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  <br>    <br>  All written responses must be received by January 21, 2015 at 3:00 PM EST.  Submissions should: (1) use Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF); (2) be sent to Shawn Haubner at shawn.p.haubner.civ@mail.mil ; (3) be minimum 11 font on 8.5 quote mark  X 11 quote mark  paper; (4) be complete, sufficiently detailed, and organized in a manner that tracks to the information requested in this RFI; (5) include a single organization point of contact with name, title, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address(es); and (6) not exceed 15 single sided pages in total (not including cover page and cover letter).

<DESC>**This announcement provides Amendment 000002 to Screening Information Request (SIR) / Request for Offer (RFO)DTFAWA-15-R-00006.  Amendment 000002 revises the date by which the FAA will post responses to offor questions from 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Monday, January 19, 2015 to 5:00 pm, EST on Monday, January 26, 2015 in accordance with the revised Section L.3.2.1 that is being provided with this amendment. In addition, this amendment revises the proposal submission due date from 2:00 p.m. EST on Friday, January 23, 2015 to 2:00 pm EST on Friday, February 6, 2015 in accordance with the revised Section L3.2.3 that is being provided with this amendment.**

**This announcement corrects the previous posting of Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) DTFAWA-15-R-00006 Amendment 000001.  The previous posting neglected to provide an amended Section A.  This announcement provides Amendment 00001 to Section A.  In addition, the previous posting of Amendment 000001 provided an Attachment J.4 that was incorrectly named Section J Att J.4 Amendment 00001.  The correct abbreviated name for this document is Section J Att J.4 Amendment 000001.  Because this correction only adds a fifth zero in the amendment number in the name for Attachment J.4 but does not change the document itself, a revised Attachment J.4 is not being provided at this time.**

**Amendment 000001 removes the previously posted Section J Attachment J.4 ARTCC CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL POWER SYSTEM SITE LIST MicroSoft (MS) Word document and replaces it with Section J Attachment J.4 Amendment 000001 in as an MS Excel document.  The amended J.4 attachment provides mailing addresses for all twenty-five (25) of the ACEPS facilities that were previously listed on the original Attachment J.4.  NOTE:  Offerors are NOT to contact these facilities in any manner  the addresses are being provided for proposal preparation only**  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the replacement of battery systems at 25 Air Route Traffic Control Center Critical/Essential Power System (ACEPS) facilities (21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), 3 large Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACONs) and 1 ACEPS training facility).  Certain facilities are supported by Valve Regulated Acid (VRLA) battery strings while other facilities are supported by Valve Lead Acid (VLA) units.  

The contractor must perform battery site visits and attend pre-installation meetings, supply and deliver the battery strings and individual batteries, remove and dispose of existing battery strings and individual batteries, install new battery strings and individual batteries, reinstall the existing battery monitoring systems and test the replacement battery strings and individual batteries with the Uninterruptible Power Module (UPM). The sequence of sites where battery strings and individual batteries must be replaced will be determined by the Government.

This Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO) requires Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products that meet the specifications in Section C.

This is a Small Business set-aside.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this effort is 335911 Storage Battery Manufacturing with the size standard of 500 employees.

The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP/IDIQ) with a period of performance of a two-year base period and six one-year option periods.  The base period is anticipated to begin April 1, 2015.

Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Robert C. Taylor II, Contracting Officer, at robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday, January 5, 2015.

<AWARDEE>Albany Molecular Research, Inc., 26 Corporate Circle, Albany, NY 12212 US
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS), National Institute of Health (NIH), has made multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards under RFP No. NIH-NINDS-14-02. IDIQ contracts have been awarded to Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (AMRI), Albany, New York, Contract No. HHSN271201500005i and MRIGlobal, Kansas City, Missouri, Contract No. HHSN271201500006i, on January 15, 2015. These contracts will cover acquisition of services to conduct studies that will support the development and manufacture of dosage forms of small molecule drug candidates suitable for administration in preclinical and clinical studies of neurological disease/disorders. Services to be provided include: manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), formulate the API, package, label, store, and distribute completed drug product.
<p>Both IDIQ contracts have been awarded with a ten (10) year ordering period of January 15, 2015 through January 14, 2025. The minimum award amount for AMRI is $20,000 and $25,000 for MRIGlobal; maximum award estimates are $37,393,571 for AMRI and $53,563,068 for MRIGlobal. Also, each organization has been awarded a funded task order with the parent IDIQ contract. The initial task order will cover performance of technical support activities under both contracts for the first 12 months of the IDIQ order period, January 15, 2015 through January 14, 2016. The initial task order award to AMRI was for $22, 211 and $49,282 to MRIGlobal. The initial task order awards also contain nine (9) additional 12-month term options as follows:</p>
<p>AMRI: <br />Option No. 1 - Technical support for Year 02 (12 months) 01/15/16- 01/14/17 - $22,819<br />Option No. 2 - Technical support for Year 03 (12 months) 01/15/17- 01/14/18 - $23,445<br />Option No. 3 - Technical support for Year 04 (12 months) 01/15/18- 01/14/19 - $24,091<br />Option No. 4 - Technical support for Year 05 (12 months) 01/15/19- 01/14/20 - $24,756<br />Option No. 5 - Technical support for Year 06 (12 months) 01/15/20- 01/14/21 - $25,440<br />Option No. 6 - Technical support for Year 07 (12 months) 01/15/21- 01/14/22 - $26,146<br />Option No. 7 - Technical support for Year 08 (12 months) 01/15/22- 01/14/23 - $26,872<br />Option No. 8 - Technical support for Year 09 (12 months) 01/15/23- 01/14/24 - $27,620<br />Option No. 9 - Technical support for Year 10 (12 months) 01/15/24- 01/14/25 - $28,391</p>
<p>Separate and distinct from the annual technical support activities, the NINDS will compete and award future Task Orders between these two contractors for all compound studies covered under the contract. Award of compound studies will be made through issuance of competitive Task Order Request for Proposals (TORFPs) as the need arises. It is anticipated that the resultant Task Order awards will be cost-reimbursement, completion-type orders and each will have variable periods of performance. The NINDS anticipates issuing two (2) to three (3) TORFPs for compound studies during each year of the IDIQ order period.</p>
