The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), through the Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), is soliciting proposals for the development and maintenance of a national field coordination program that provides specialized staff support and child welfare expertise in designated locations nationwide to the Division of Unaccompanied Children’s Services (DUCS) Federal Field and Central Office staff. 

ORR intends to acquire the services of bilingual Field Coordinators to enhance, support and facilitate the work of DUCS Central Office and Field staff, particularly in the areas of family reunification, identification and analysis of trends and special needs, and placement recommendations.  This will be achieved by assigning DUCS Field Coordinators nationally to target locations.  In most cases, Field Coordinators will be deployed in or around areas where a Federal Field Specialist (FFS) has been designated.

Field coordinators will work closely with Federal Field Specialists, who serve as the Federal field representative of the DUCS program and are responsible for implementing Central Office policies and procedures; liaising with local immigration officials, non-profit agencies and legal service providers; providing guidance and direction to local care providers; and making transfer and release decisions for UAC in their designated regions.  

The main responsibilities of the Field Coordinators will include, but not be limited to: (1) Providing timely review, assessment, and recommendation of family reunification requests to the designated FFS; (2) Ensuring that children are placed in the least restrictive setting while receiving appropriate services; (3) Conducting regular site visits to designated DUCS-contracted care providers; (4) Participating in weekly case staffing meetings with care providers and FFS; (5) Participating in monthly collaborative meetings with local DHS officials, care provider staff, legal service providers, and the designated Federal Field Specialist; (6) Providing targeted technical assistance to care provider staff, as directed by DUCS staff; (7) Referring at-risk children for suitability assessments and follow 	up services, in collaboration with care provider and FFS; and (8) Making placement referrals and recommendations for children who require more specialized levels of care, such as long-term foster care and residential treatment centers, in collaboration with care provider and FFS.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION MARKET SURVEY FOR INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES General Information: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources that can provide instructional support services required by Airway Facilities Division (AMA-400), at the FAA Academy, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Overview -The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing instructional and related support services to augment existing Airway Facilities Division (AMA-400) staff in the completion of its tasked activities. The contractor will provide those on-site personnel needed to effectively manage and supervise the contract staff and perform clerical and administrative functions.  The FAA Academy is a resident training center. On average, AMA-400 has 579 active courses that provide approximately 1250 resident class deliveries per year. This equates to approximately 6500 resident completions and 832,176 resident hours annually.   The requirement centers primarily on the instructional delivery of AMA-400 technical training. This includes theoretical and practical training in one or more subjects on assigned National Airspace System (NAS) equipment and systems for field technical experts involved with the installation and maintenance of such equipment and systems.  Delivery of instructional courses is in accordance with FAA training procedures, guidelines, and methodologies. Instructors are required to follow prepared lesson plans and ensure stated course objectives are presented.  Instructors will utilize such teaching methods as lecture, lab demonstrations, and remedial discussion. The instructor selects/uses or develops teaching aids such as, but not limited to, lesson plans, student guides, lab guides, handouts, wall charts, prepared notes, and use of actual lab equipment.  Contract instructors may also be required to provide support as subject matter experts in the development, revision, and maintenance of course materials, utilizing all applicable media.   The FAA may also identify requirements for other instructional support personnel including but not limited to, instructional systems design specialists, course developers, technical  writers, and illustrators. The instructional system design specialist is responsible for organizing and conducting research, development, evaluation, revision, and maintenance of training materials for resident, field, and distance learning training courses, supporting the National Airspace System (NAS). Knowledge of major principles and theories in human learning and cognitive psychology is required in order to determine instructional objectives and task learning relationships, classify instructional objectives, and develop course content sequences.  Additionally, knowledge of principles, methodologies, and techniques of task analysis is required in order to ensure training outcomes are congruent with required knowledge, skills, and abilities. Instructional development and revision of course materials and support media for resident, field and distance learning courses would be performed by course developers, illustrators, and technical writers with applicable experience in the following areas: art and design, drafting, desktop publishing, computer animation, courseware development authoring languages, ability to proofread and edit material for reports, manuals, briefs, proposals, instructional books, catalogs, and training publications, or related specialty materials. Past Performance and Experience - The FAA is looking for a contractor with a proven track record of excellence in the performance of contracts in an environment of a similar size and complexity.  The contractor is required to show three (3) years experience within the past five (5) years in instructional support and delivery.  Past and present contract performance information must demonstrate the contractor is capable to perform the proposed effort.

All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or for any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA certified 8(a) firms and small business concerns.   The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing instructional support services. At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other small business competitive procurement procedures. Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter (if applicable). The failure to obtain adequate 8(a) or other small business participation in this market survey may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures. Response to this Market Survey - Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.

<DESC>The Government intends to purchase a Real-Time Aerosol Spray Sizing Analyzer capable of covering a particle size range of 0.1 to 900 micrometers on a sole source basis.  Purchase will be made from Malvern Instruments in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  The items to be purchased are 1 ea STP5311, Sptaytec Standard Lab System with 300mm measurement zone and 300mm lens and STP2520 Wet Sample Accessory.

No other sources have been identified which offer a benchtop apparatus capable of real-time aerosol spray particle size determination, such that a spray can be discharged directly into the apparatus from widely varied working distances to immediately characterize the particle size distribution, and be able to analyze the particle variation over time, with purged optics to prevent buildup of the spray contents on the optical system that collects the measurements.  The system allows working distances of over 1 meter for 100 micron particles and 150mm for 0.5micron particles.  This system includes an adapter to measure particle size suspended solids in liquid samples with an in-line pump and stirrer and requiring only 50-170ml samples.  It can measure particle size distribution at 2500 measurements per second allowing the changes in droplet size during spray actuation to be followed in real-time, to assess dynamics.  Measurement of the output of the aerosol can also be made over relatively long distances, allowing the wide spray plumes to be accurately sampled and measured.  All of these capabilities would enable the staff to reproduce realistic scenarios for different product types and determine realistic exposure models for consumers in anticipated uses of the product.  These requirements are critical to teh staff need for the instrument, as inhalation risks for aerosol products are dependent. amoung other things, on the particle size distribution of the aerosol plume at varied time and distance from spraying.

If completely qualified sources for this system exist, they must submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 3:00 p.m. eastern time by the response date listed above.   Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for a flight demonstration and associated documentation for alternate source(s) for future production of Subsonic Subscale Aerial Targets (SSATs).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is planned for release in July 2006.  Multiple awards are possible, subject to available funding.  The period of performance is one year.  Potential sources must have an existing production aerial target type vehicle that will meet the U.S. Navy’s requirements for a SSAT System, or can be cost effectively modified to meet all of the SSAT requirements. This is NOT a development effort.  

As part of the flight demonstration documentation, the effort will require submittal of a detailed technical description of the existing system, its current performance capabilities and support operations, previous testing data to ensure Range safety, and a complete description of the modifications, if any, that would be necessary to achieve full technical compliance with the U.S Navy’s SSAT system requirements.  The successful offeror will perform flight demonstrations of the existing production aerial target type vehicle at the Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, Point Mugu, California.  At the discretion of the successful offeror, the existing system demonstrated need not be fully compliant with the SSAT system requirements, however, it must demonstrate the system’s potential.    

Prospective sources should thoroughly review the SSAT System requirements contained in the SSAT System Requirements Document (SRD) to ensure that they understand the full requirements and have a potentially compliant, competitive system before bidding on the solicitation.  The SSAT SRD will be available on-line at the PMA-208 web site: www.navair.navy.mil/pma208 under “current events” on or before 14 Jul 2006.

<DESC>Solicitation Number N00421-06-T-0189 is hereby released as a request for quotes for “Brand Name Mandatory” HP/DELL commercial products.  Simplified procedures as described in FAR 13.5 will be utilized for acquisition of the required items.  The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order for Commercial Items on a “Brand Name Mandatory”  basis for the Hewlett Packard/Dell products listed below under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.     This procurement is set-aside for Small Business.  The Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) St. Inigoes, MD, has been tasked to provide a customized version of the  Marine Corps Distance Learning Program (MCDLP) Deployable Learning Resource Center (DLRC) for the Naval Sea Warrior IT Program Management Office.  The DLRC will be used to support Naval Expeditionary Forces and OCONUS Sea Warrior product deployment.  The DLRC System will consist of one DLRC server and additional peripheral components, including laptops that will be connected either to the DLRC server or to any network plug on a common network segment.  The system components of the SWITPMO DLRC must be identical to components previously procured for the MCDLP system as the operability and integration of the components have been previously tested for use as an integrated stand-alone network.  The Hewlett Packard server and the Dell laptops are the only products that will meet the DLRC requirements.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 334111, “Electronic Computer Manufacturing” with a size standard of 1,000  employees.

Eight (8)  ASF-PC104-1 MIL-STD-1553 interface cards to be used as a component of the radar interface unit (RICU) on the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC).  The equipment is currently used on the new system upgraded LCAC.  NSWC-PC has been tasked by NAVICP to procure this item, alter the item per the drawings, and return to NAVICP to place in the supply system.   b. Four (4) ASF-PMC2-1 MIL-STD-1553 interface cards (N00178-6139C114) being acquired as spares to reduce the downtime of the SIL when a failure occurs.

The MIL-STD-1553 cards developed by SBS technologies are the cards used in existing LCAC C4N SLEP systems installed on the fleet making it essential for the runtime environment in the UKB. For repairable items it is critical that the components be a one to one replacement for configuration management purposes as well as to ensure 100% form, fit, and function.  Additionally, for the spare cards it is critical that the SIL test bed duplicate the operational environment exactly in order to ensure consistency of performance and data credibility.   A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated. Award will be based on the written quotation. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity-Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Anticipated award date will be on or about July 17, 2006.

<DESC>The BLM, Amarillo Field Office requires a Well Consultant to advise BLM on all aspects of Reservoir and Production Engineering.  This requirement will be offered as a Commercial Acquisition per FAR part 12, firm-fixed price, 100% small business set-aside under NAICS 541330, Engineering Services, with a size standard of $4.5 Milltion.  HISTORY OF REQUIREMENT: The U. S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office, operates a 310-Bcf gas storage reservoir that contains approximately 26 Bcf of injected Government and privately owned helium in a partially depleted natural gas field. The gas field contains 29 wells, which include 18 withdrawal wells, 6 injection wells, and 5 observation wells. The storage reservoir is located approximately 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas at the Cliffside site.  A 425-mile crude helium gas transmission pipeline connects private helium refiners and crude helium extraction plants to the storage reservoir.  The BLM entered into a contract to perform reservoir simulation of the Cliffside field during 2002.  This was deemed necessary by an audit recommending we use an independent third party engineering specialist to conduct a helium study and model a reservoir simulation for the gas field.  Through the use of this reservoir simulation, we have determined that additional wells will need to be drilled to recover the stored crude helium.  The reservoir parameters, such as skin damage and permeability, need to be better defined to enhance the reservoir simulation.  Production and reservoir parameters need to be evaluated to enhance the recovery of crude helium from the Cliffside field and the overall depletion of the field.  The reservoir was discovered in 1929. From discovery until about 1963 gas was produced and helium extracted and purified.  The field produced about 54 Bcf of gas during this time.  In 1963, the US Government began injecting crude helium into the field as part of the helium conservation program.  About 54 Bcf of crude helium was injected and 3 Bcf of native gas withdrawn over the next ten years.  In 1973, the Government cancelled its helium purchase contracts and began storing privately owned crude helium.  Over the next 20 years, the field was normally in the injection mode during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is high and private plants produce excess crude helium, which is injected into and stored in the reservoir. When the natural gas demand dropped in the summer, the supply of helium decreased, resulting in the need for crude helium to be produced out of the storage reservoir to meet market demand. Along with the production and/or injection of crude helium, native gas was produced from the outer native gas wells to supply fuel gas for the BLM helium purification plant.  During the early to mid- 1990's, the injection and production cycle became less dramatic as private companies increased their stockpile of stored, crude helium in the reservoir.  Native gas from the field was still supplied to the BLM purification plant.  The BLM in conjunction with private industry has built a crude helium enrichment unit at the Cliffside site.  This unit processes about 20 MMcf per day of natural gas from the Bush Dome reservoir blended to a helium content of about 30%.  The BLM expects to deplete the field over the next 15 years.  SERVICES REQUIRED UNDER CONTRACT: Generally, the contractor will provide services related to well workover design and specification, production tubing and downhole component configuration, and design and perform reservoir tests.  Additionally, the contractor will design and write specifications to produce water from wells that are difficult to keep on production.  It is anticipated that a follow-on contract will be awarded to perform other tasks over a multi-year period.  This will include specification and design for drilling, testing, and completions of wells, filing appropriate forms with the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), and design and perform reservoir tests.  QUALIFICATIONS:  The contractor will have a broad range of experience in production, drilling, and reservoir engineering.  The contractor is required to perform as a consultant for production, drilling, and reservoir engineering, as needed.  The contractor will be experienced in all aspects of reservoir, drilling, and   production engineering.  TASKS: The contractor will design, oversee, and act as a consultant for BLM on the following tasks: 1) Design and Perform reservoir tests for existing Bush Dome Wells.  The testing will begin in FY 2006.  The testing will be designed and performed in conjunction with tasks ii and iii below.  A long-term testing and monitoring program will also be designed as part of this task.  The testing will be performed while the field is being produced, requiring coordination with BLM personnel. (2) Dewatering of wells.  The consultant will deliver recommendations for the best method to be used to keep Fuqua A-1 and Bush A-9 from watering off.  This will include a detailed report for the design, downhole configuration, and all components necessary to dewater the wells.  Consultant will also oversee the installation of the recommended components. (3) Workovers.  Recommendations for workovers, recompletions, new completions, hydraulic fracturing, and acidizing will be completed for at least the following nine wells:  Bivins A-3, Bivins A-4, Bivins A-5, Bivins A-13, Bivins A-14, Bush A-3, Bush A-5, Bush A-8, and Bush B-1.  The recommendations and requirements are due by January, 2007.  The remainder of the wells will be reviewed in following years.  The reservoir testing program will be a major factor in determining the work needed on the other wells.  A review of the completion of the wells will be undertaken to determine new zones to be perforated, greater perforation shot density in existing zones, the need for acidizing or hydraulic fracturing, and perforated zones to cement.  (4) Design and specification for drilling and completion of new wells.  The consultant will prepare a drilling program plan with justification and specifications for drilling up to six new gas wells on the Bush Dome.  At such time as drilling commences, the consultant will act as a technical representative for the BLM.  DELIVERABLES: (1) Design of reservoir testing procedures for existing wells.  The consultant will design and perform necessary tests to determine permeability, skin factor ("true" and "pseudo"), radius of investigation, well interference, and deliverability.  The friction and gas column pressure losses recorded during the testing will be reported.  The results of the test will be presented in graphical form, with data recorded and presented as an Excel spreadsheet with applicable graphs and equations.  A report of the primary findings of the test results will be presented as a Word document. (2) Dewatering of wells.  The consultant will deliver recommendations for dewatering the well-bores of Bush A-9 and Fuqua A-1. The recommendations will include a description of the method(s).  The consultant will include the specifications for down-hole components, production string, packers, etc.  Also included will be the design of any surface equipment necessary to dewater the wells.  The specifications and design will be according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) standards.  (3) Workovers.  After review and testing of each well, a report of recommendations for increasing productivity will be prepared with the following information: Probable zones for new completions;  Probable zones for re-completions, specifically increased number of shots per foot;  Recommended zones to cement;  Zones that will benefit from acidizing or hydraulic fracturing.  Changes to downhole tubing and equipment configurations; A statement of work describing, in detail, the equipment, material, labor, procedures, time, and estimated costs to complete the recommended workover described in the report;  Follow-up test of well productivity after workover; The specifications and design will be according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) standards.  (4) Design and specification drilling and completion of new wells.  The consultant will prepare a drilling program for each proposed well that will include the following: The estimated tops of important geologic markers; The estimated depths at which the top and the bottom of anticipated water, gas, or other mineral-bearing formations are expected to be encountered, and the plans for protecting such resources; The minimum specifications for pressure control equipment to be used and a schematic diagram showing sizes, pressure ratings or API series, proposed testing procedures and testing frequency; The consultant will prepare a casing program for each well that includes surface, intermediate, and production casing depths, specifications and casing integrity test requirements; and any supplementary information more completely describing the drilling equipment and casing program as required by the RRC of Texas; The type and characteristics of the proposed circulating medium or mediums to be employed in drilling, the quantities and types of mud and weighting material to be maintained, and the monitoring equipment to be used on the mud system; The anticipated type and amount of testing, logging, and coring; The expected bottomhole pressure and any anticipated abnormal pressures or temperatures or potential hazards, such as hydrogen sulfide, expected to be encountered, along with contingency plans for mitigating such identified hazards; The consultant will include requirements for reserve pits and onsite pits. These requirements must meet the higher of the RRC or BLM standards; Any other facets of the proposed operation which the consultant desires to point out for the to the BLM; and all drilling program specifications and designs must meet or exceed RRC regulations and API standards.

<SOLNBR>PR-CI-06-10950
<ARCHDATE>08242006
<CONTACT>JAMIE L. SCLAFANI, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2045, E-Mail: sclafani.jamie@epa.gov
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is seeking a contractor to develop an aerosol deposition system for use in the systematic decontamination studies.  This system will be used by the U.S. EPA National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) Decontamination and Consequence Management Division?s (DCMD) systematic decontamination program to evaluate the efficacy of decontamination technologies. The NHSRC is currently investigating various decontamination technologies for high value building materials contaminated with Bacillus anthracis.  Current ongoing studies inoculate building material coupons using a syringe (liquid droplets).  However, the likely dissemination method for B. anthracis is aerosol dispersion, thus building materials will be contaminated by dry deposition.  Liquid inoculation may yield non-comparable decontamination efficacy results to actual event decontamination efforts for porous materials such as cinder block and wood.  A system for the dry inoculation of building material coupons is needed to ensure comparable efficacy results during decontamination efforts. In response to the need for reproducibly dosing building material coupons with dry B. anthracis, the DCMD is seeking to develop an aerosol deposition system for use in the systematic decontamination studies.  The aerosol deposition system includes an aerosol generator and all pumps, blowers, etc. necessary for the system to operate.  The system shall be able to repeatedly  dose coupons with user defined spore loadings in the range of 100 to 100,000,000 spores per coupon with an uncertainty of 20%. The area of the coupons is 7 square cm.   The terminal velocities of these spores shall mimic those expected in an anthrax release.  The system shall be applicable to all building materials of interest, specifically: painted and unpainted cinder block, stainless steel ductwork, industrial carpet, decorative laminate, ceiling tile, painted wallboard, and glass.  The system shall be able to uniformly dose (all coupons will receive a dose of plus or minus 20% of the user set dose)  at least twenty-five 20 mm x 35 mm coupons during a single deposition and the coupons shall be easy to remove, ensuring minimal disruption of the deposited particulate matter.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement NESCAUM, 101 Merrimac St., 10th Floor, Boston, MA 02114 to review and provide expert comments on the current draft ASTM (American Society for Testing Materials) test method and develop a model regulation for states wishing to address outdoor wood-fired hydronic heater aka outdoor wood boiler (OWB) emissions.  The test method is the critical path for both voluntary and regulatory efforts to address OWB emissions.  The model rule would reduce the amount of resources required by a State to develop a rule and would assist in maintaining consistency across States. Task 1.  Review of Draft ASTM Test Method for OWB.  The contractor shall coordinate with States and a technical expert to review the draft ASTM laboratory test method and provide technical expertise to support development of an appropriate  test method.  In addition, this task may include comments on the feasibility of developing a test method appropriate for testing in the field.  One of the first steps in moving towards reducing emissions from OWBs is the development of a test method to create a common method for all units to measure emissions.  There are two main draft methods to test these units, one method measures emissions under strictly controlled operating, conditions; while the other method measures emissions in the field under real-world operating conditions (often operating parameters are not as strictly controlled as in laboratory conditions).  Since 2004 an ASTM workgroup has been working on developing a laboratory test method with the goal of consensus from manufacturers, labs, regulatory agencies and other interested parties.  In order to support State efforts to participate in this effort, NESCAUM shall coordinate with States to review the  draft laboratory test method and provide technical expertise to support development of appropriate test method(s).   Task 2.  Development of a Model Rule for OWB.  This task is to develop a model rule that would be beneficial for States to address OWB emissions.  Since 2002, NESCAUM has assisted States with efforts focused on outdoor wood boilers.  Several States have implemented regulations requiring setbacks, while others have used outreach to attempt to resolve the issue.  The increased sales, has created interest in developing a regulation to require the development of cleaner burning units.  EPA has indicated that at this time, a national rule may not be appropriate; however, development of a model rule would be beneficial for both States and manufacturers.  A model rule would reduce the amount of resources required by a State to develop a rule.  In addition, a model rule would assist in maintaining.  The anticipated  period of performance for this requirement is date of award through 12 months.   EPA believes NESCAUM is the only vendor capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements. The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.302, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements."  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exists and, therefore, no RFP is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide a capability statement but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.  All interested parties must respond within 15 days of the date of this announcement to Natalia Fisher-Jackson, at the above address.  Interested vendors shall:  1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) fully explain  your capabilities and qualifications and; 3) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Response to this synopsis must be made in writing.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541810   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation to be issued for proposals and a written solicitation will not be issued.  PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE.  Solicitation RFQ-GA-06-00042 is issued as a Commercial Solicitation using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR Part 13.  This acquisition will be 100% small business set-aside.  The  NAICS code is 541810.  The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer best conforms to the Statement of Work (SOW), meets the Government's delivery schedule and is the most cost effective in accordance with the Evaluation  Criteria below.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those that are in effect through the latest Federal Acquisition Circular.  The contractor shall be required to provide non-personal services to include all labor, design, tools, equipment, material, and other  items and services necessary to develop and implement the following Statement of Work (SOW).  STATEMENT OF WORK  1.BACKGROUND:  The Worker Protection Standard (WPS) has been in effect since 1992.  The EPA Regions and States have made great strides in implementing the WPS provisions; however,  despite these efforts there is still a need to enhance our outreach and communication efforts.  Specifically, EPA needs to find more effective ways to educate workers regarding their rights under the WPS. In addition, EPA seeks to undertake activities to address the current violation reporting  system, providing greater assurance of the anonymity of the workers that report violations.  To accomplish this we will use innovative methods for reaching and educating farm workers on their rights under the WPS. The purpose of the Radio Outreach to Hispanic Agricultural Workers Project is to  develop and disseminate educational information on pesticide farm safety and the WPS to Spanish speaking farm workers via radio Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on Spanish language radio stations.  Many Spanish speaking farm workers remain unaware of the WPS or the fact that they can report  violations of the WPS.  Furthermore, those that do wish to report violations are afraid to do so for fear of retaliation, even though the WPS has provisions against such retaliation.  Thus, through radio PSAs which shall supply a toll-free number, individuals can call and be referred to the  appropriate agency for filing an anonymous complaint, or be referred to a place where they can get more information on pesticide safety.  The contractor shall develop a program to develop and disseminate PSAs, with content provided and approved by EPA. 2.GOALS:  A. To educate Spanish speaking farm  workers about the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) and basic pesticide safety on the farm and at home. B. To increase Spanish speaking farm workers' reporting of violations of the WPS. C. To increase Spanish speaking farm workers' calls to a toll free number to answer pesticides related  questions. 3.OBJECTIVES: A. Development of a series of PSAs in Spanish, which shall be transferable to radio stations throughout Region 4. B. Collect data on the number of call-in responses to a toll free number in response to the PSA. 4. PERFORMANCE REQUIRED: Item 1. The contractor shall develop  a series of 10 to 12 Public Service Announcements (PSAs), in accordance with generally-accepted radio broadcast practices.  The PSA content and presentation shall be approved by the EPA Project Officer.  The series shall cover all basic areas of the Worker Protection Standards (WPS), as well as  general pesticide safety and violation reporting. Each PSA shall be one to two minutes in length, and shall inform listeners of the toll-free number that they may call anonymously for further information about pesticides or how to report violations.   The contractor shall provide EPA with both  print and recorded copies of all PSAs in a format or media that would be most readily transferable to additional radio stations for broadcast.  The contractor shall also grant EPA all data rights for additional use of the material. EPA will provide the contractor with copies of 24 previously  approved PSAs that covered the basic areas of the WPS and pesticide safety, which may be incorporated into the new PSAs if desired.  The Contractor will develop PSAs in close consultation with EPA specialists, and EPA will approve or disapprove the series of PSAs within 30 days of submittal.   Item 2. The contractor shall be responsible for distributing copies of the PSA series to Spanish language radio stations whose broadcast signals are normally capable of being heard in southern Georgia (from a latitude including Macon south), and obtaining the agreement of those stations to air  the PSAs as specified.  The PSAs must begin to be aired no later than the sixth full month after award of the purchase order. The contractor shall be paid for each Spanish language station (up to a maximum of 15) that airs the series of PSAs between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.  Each  radio station must agree to air the full series of PSAs at least once per month during the ten month period in which the toll free number is operational.   The contractor shall submit to EPA documentation from each station stating that they aired the PSAs as specified. Item 3. The contractor  shall provide a toll-free telephone number which may be dialed from anywhere in Georgia, including south of Macon.  Such line shall be manned by a Spanish speaking operator(s) at least eight hours a day on normal Federal business days anytime between 5:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.  Such line shall be  maintained for a period of ten months, beginning with the airing of the first PSA.  The operators shall be trained to obtain correct violation info, provide callers with basic pesticide information, and/or direct them to other information.  EPA specialists will provide the Contractor with  information regarding where to refer different types of calls, and the information to be provided. Within 60 days after the end of the ten month period, the contractor shall provide EPA with a final report of all activities included in this purchase order, and specifically listing the number and  types of calls received (whether reporting violations or requesting information) and general summary information about call activity and other work performed for this purchase order. 5. EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Award will be based on Best Value where price is more important than experience and past  performance information. Offerors shall provide past performance information that illustrates they have performed work in the areas stated below, including references, contract/order no., performance period, technical point of contact and phone number. A. Working with Hispanic audiences on health  and safety related issues or other issues of concern to the community; B. Developing professional quality PSAs in Spanish; C. Distributing PSAs to Hispanic radio stations, and more specifically radio Stations which broadcast in the Southern Georgia area; D. Provision and maintenance of a toll  free number for responses to the PSAs; E. Ability to track call-in data to a toll free number for determining the effectiveness of the media message; F.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Breen Energy Solutions to perform and validate a definitive kinetic study of mercury oxidation mechanisms, including the effect of flue gas temperature gradients and heterogeneous kinetic mechanisms on the extent of high temperature mercury oxidation at the U.S. EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory.  The current NAICS code is 541710. Based on the EPA's knowledge of  the Technical Support needed for the Statement of Work (SOW) there may be unique capabilities to particular contractors/consultants.  The SOW is as follows: STATEMENT OF WORK Enhancement of Mercury Oxidation on a Pilot-Scale Coal Fired Combustor Period of Performance:  12 Months from the date of  award  Estimated Level of Effort:   The level of effort for this project is estimated to be 250 hours. Goal  The goal of the proposed project is to perform and validate a kinetic study of mercury oxidation mechanisms, including the effect of flue gas temperature gradients and heterogeneous  kinetic mechanisms on the extent of high temperature mercury oxidation. This work provides an important alternative mercury oxidation enhancement technology that maximizes carbon effects and doesn't require the addition of chlorine or bromine compounds either to the flue gas or to activated  carbon. This requirement would further the EPA's mission as follows: "The work would serve to explain the variability in mercury emissions often observed and documented under the EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR) and will provide a foundation for the extension of studies now being  conducted to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers."  The work would produce a kinetic model of mercury speciation, which would be a valuable national resource as utility and industrial coal-fired boilers implement technology to meet mercury regulations through a wide range of national  coal supply.  This will fill an important gap in the current understanding of mercury oxidation mechanisms. "Results would be published in a peer-reviewed journal and at trade shows to add to the national knowledge base on mercury and disseminate the results to a wide audience. Approach  1.  Areas  of interest and parameters to be tested include the following test matrix: "  Flue gas starting temperature. "  Flue gas temperature gradient across heat exchanger (economizer simulation). "  Coal type (sub-bituminous and bituminous). "  Coal Cl and mercury content. "  Fly ash carbon levels and  carbon surface activity. "  Continuing experiment planning, test matrix development and on-going data review. "  Available kinetic modeling results will provide guidance, definition and a-priori predictions for this matrix. 2.  Test runs at NRMRL's combustor "  Testing and experimental  verification of existing kinetic curves. "  Obtain parametric data for: flue gas temperature entering and leaving heat exchanger flue gas temperature rate of change (quenching rate) in heat exchanger fly ash unburned carbon levels Coal rank and chlorine content  	oxidized mercury entering and  leaving heat exchanger. "  Define maximum mercury oxidation possible, and limitations to oxidation. 3.  Data reduction, reporting and publication of results Task 1: Test Definition/Matrix Development with the Laboratory EPA Laboratory Responsibilities: 1.  Laboratory personnel will provide the  Contractor with drawings, flue gas flow rates and temperatures, and firing rates for the Multi-Pollutant Control Research Facility (MPCRF). 2.

The Laboratory will  install thermocouples for measuring the flue gas temperature going into and out of HX 2-b of the MPCRF. 4.  The Laboratory will work with the Contractor to finalize the actual test matrix. Contractor Tasks: 1.  The Contractor shall use data provided by the Laboratory to evaluate flue gas cooling  rates at the various heat exchangers in the combustor. 2.  The Contractor shall specify where to install additional flue gas sampling and temperature measurement capabilities. 3.  The Contractor shall work with the Laboratory to finalize the actual test matrix.  The test matrix will be combinations  of the following parameters, plus any other items identified during Task 1 and capable of being tested/varied. Parametric Variable	                     Conditions to be tested Coal Type	                     Subituminous, bituminous Flue gas quench rate,  F/s            Max. possible, 2000  F/s,                                                       1000  F/s Flue gas inlet temperature,  F	     1250, 1150, 1100 Flue gas outlet temperature,  F	     750, 650, 600 Coal Cl, ppm (by weight, daf basis)   As found in coal  LOI, wt. %	                        Baseline, +1%, +3% as                                                          active surface of C CO spike, ppm	                      25, 100 Task 2: Perform Experiments at NRMRL Combustor EPA Laboratory Responsibilities: 1.  The Laboratory will fire the combustor according to the test matrix defined in Task 1. An EPA technician or on-site  contractor will operate the combustor and sampling equipment. 2.  Set-up and demonstration of temperature control and flue gas monitoring may require at least one week of firing prior to data collection.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a continuation of the action previously announced under W15QKN-06-T-0616:          The U.S. Army, Research, Development and Engineering Center â€“ Picatinny is  contemplating the issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) set aside for  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions   (HBCU/MI) which have the experience and knowledge to explore and develop the  specific directed research topics discussed below. It is anticipated that the proposed Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be  available on FedBizOpps on or about June 22, 2006.  Interested, responsible  institutions (offerors) will have forty-five days to respond with proposals  when the BAA is published. The proposed BAA provides an opportunity for Academia to explore and develop  specific areas of science and technology (and their applications to these  specific areas) which are of interest to the U.S.Army.  There are a total of  four research topics within three Science and Technology areas that have  applications of interest to the U.S. Army at this time: Â·	Armaments Science & Technology Area: Ballistic Impact Dynamic Modeling of Fabric for New Protection Systems:   Develop innovative design tool for evaluating the performance of fabrics that  will be used in improved protection systems against current and future threats. Â·	Battlespace Awareness Science & Technology Area:  Innovative Intelligence Agent and Cognitive Decision Aids Component Technology  for Net Centric Fires: Develop real time intelligent agent based algorithms and reusable code  components that can provide the basis for developing the next generation of  intelligent, network centric fires management, execution and control software  for Future Combat System applications. Target Image Transformation and Transfer: Determine a methodology to resize, transform, compress and transfer the image  of a target and associated reference points from a Fire Control system to an  autonomous small caliber projectile and store the image in the projectile. Â·	Novel/Directed Energy Science & Technology Area:  Hybrid Soldier Power Source:  Develop novel concepts for methods and devices to harvest electrical energy  during locomotion for hybrid power systems for soldiers.  The power must  provide a power source that is safe and light-weight.  The power source must  not provide a thermal signature, be cumbersome, increase fatigue or interfer  with the free movement of the user. The overall objective of the proposed BAA is to create relationships with the  targeted Institutions and introduce the aforementioned Institutions to the  technology trends available at the U.S. Army Research, Development and  Engineering Center.  Although these concepts are considered basic research, it  is desirable to mature these concepts for possible future programs. No responses to this notice are required.  The purpose is only to advise  interested colleges, universities, and institutions of the intent of the  Department of the Army to introduce a BAA on the aforementioned topics at the  time frame cited in this message.

<SUBJECT>R -- Development of a Database of Dietary Supplement Labels
<SOLNBR>263-2006-P-(GI)-0112
<RESPDATE>071006
<CONTACT>Terita Stevenson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-3727, Fax 301-480-1203, Email stevenst@od.nih.gov
<DESC>This announcement is hereby amended to extend the closing due date and change the time.     ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MUST ARRIVE ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE AND TIME.     THE CLOSING DATE FOR RESPONSES IS EXTENDED TO  JULY 17, 2006.     THE CLOSING TIME FOR THE RESPONSES IS CHANGED TO 2:30 PM.
The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), National Institutes of Health, seeks to issue a statement of work (SOW) to obtain services related to the design, development, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of a new, publicly available, web-based application for cataloging all known dietary supplement labels sold in the United States in a database tentatively called Dietary Supplements Label Database (DSLD). The goal of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit feedback from capable vendors that will help finalize the SOW.  

The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of both Government requirements and industry capabilities.  The pre-solicitation conference is to be used to 1) disseminate background data that offer further insight into the size and complexity of this acquisition, as well as the risks of undertaking this project, 2) clarify and inform the development of a detailed statement of work, and 3) discuss anticipated difficulties.  

A complete and comprehensive source of information containing virtually all dietary supplement labels does not currently exist. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) supplement label database is incomplete, as it contains only supplements reported by survey respondents.  The need for DSLD is apparent from numerous communications of stakeholders, from Congress, and deliberations within the ODS. It is hoped that an existing Federal database can be further developed so as to allow the research community and other interested stakeholders free access to dietary supplement label information.  

Such an application is needed as a resource both for research and educational purposes. The need for a complete, comprehensive, publicly available and readily accessible source of total label information and data is increasing as sales and use of dietary supplements grow (Radimer K et al, Am J Epi 160:339, 2004).  ODS believes that industry cooperation is essential to obtain complete coverage of all dietary supplements sold in the United States. 

The ultimate NIH goal is a DSLD containing label information for all products marketed and sold through all distribution channels in the United States. This would meet the research and informational needs of research investigators, health professionals, Federal and state agencies, and consumers. Researchers conducting epidemiological studies would find the dietary supplement database application useful in estimating total exposures to various dietary supplement ingredients and their associations with health outcomes. Researchers planning clinical trials require information on dietary supplement content for calculation of interventions involving them and in assessing and planning dietary intakes. Federal and state agencies need information on the content of dietary supplements to estimate current intakes and to plan nutritional interventions and recommendations. 

DSLD would also meet the needs of other segments of the dietary supplement community.  Dietitians would be able to obtain information on the composition of dietary supplement products for computing dietary intakes of nutrients or other bioactive constituents. Health professionals would be able to search for ingredients with beneficial or adverse effects. Industry might find product formulations or comparisons with competitive products of interest. Policy makers might find the application useful for calculating the contributions of various dietary supplements to total nutrient intakes. 

The immediate goal of this Request for Information is to identify capable vendors and solicit ideas on the development processes so as to inform the finalization of a Statement of Work.  An integral part of this work is understanding and defining both the technical components and processes and the project management components and processes. 

ODS anticipates a 12-month requirements (feasibility) development effort.  Requirements development should be approached by the vendor becoming familiar with other Federal research efforts in this area for the purposes of interfacing.  At its completion, ODS requires a report defining the feasibility of continuing this effort into its design phase and delivery of a prototype dietary supplements label database.  

It is important that the DSLD interface well with existing databases, especially the NHANES/ NCHS/CDC survey dietary supplement label database and the USDA/ARS standard reference database for food composition, in order to maximize the utility of the DSLD for the government, researchers, and the public. 

Contractors expressing an interest should provide appropriate capability statements.  The capability statement shall include the following:

<DESC>******** DUE DATE FOR RESPONSES IS EXTENDED TO 20 JUL 2006 AT 3PM CST ***********
This is not a Request for proposal and the Government will not pay for any information requested in this Request For Information (RFI).  Responses will be done at no cost to the Government.  The government is contemplating a firm fixed price type of contract to fulfill this requirement.  Initial research indicates this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices, terms and conditions for consideration.  It will be the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions in any resultant Request for Proposal and awarded contract.
The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is responsible for the management and operation of thirteen Air Force Bases located in several southern states.  Three of AETC’s bases are located in the electrically deregulated part of Texas: Sheppard AFB near Wichita Falls, TX, Goodfellow AFB near San Angelo, TX, and Laughlin AFB near Del Rio, TX.  These bases have an aggregated energy requirement of approximately 225,000 Megawatt Hours per year and a peak demand of approximately 45 Megawatts.  For these bases, AETC is interested in developing an aggregated electric supply solution.  AETC is considering the use of a special purpose Retail Electric Provider (REP).  AETC believes that a special purpose REP will create opportunities for AETC to more economically manage its forward supply needs utilizing a portfolio purchasing method that will allow further opportunities for AETC to purchase a mix of generation types (traditional and renewable fuels), while lending flexibility for the purchase of unique renewable resources (i.e., solar, landfill gas, wind, municipal solid waste).  Purchases of renewable energy resources are required under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  To achieve these objectives AETC wishes to identify an Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market participant that is a registered Retail Electric Provider.
As part of Market Research, this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to determine if there is more than one Retail Energy Provider (REP) capable of providing the services described above.  Also, based on the responses to this RFI a determination of suitability for small business set aside will be made.
The North American Industry System Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 221122 with a maximum size standard for small business designation of 4 million megawatt hours per year.  Once Market Research has been completed, the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  It will be the responsibility of prospective offerors’ to check this site regularly for any postings or changes.  Prospective offerors’ must be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Registration (CCR) and must be qualified to perform in the correct NAICS code as aforementioned.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  All prospective offerors’ shall indicate their size standard (large business, small business, 8a, HUBZone, SDB/8(a), SD-VOSB, VOSB, WOSB, etc.) when replying to this RFI.  Provide a single point-of-contact to include an e-mail address, your Federal Cage Code, and your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  
In your response briefly describe your company, years of experience in the Texas market as an REP, number of employees, and the physical locations of (i) your main offices, (ii) your REP operations, (iii) your QSE operations, and (iv) your back office services.

<DESC>This amendment to the REQUEST FOR INFORMATION N00024-06-R-6350 is to change and clarify the following: 1)	The Government’s intent for soliciting information from industry regarding the availability of mature systems for mounted (motor vehicle mounted) Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) mission is to determine market availability and potential sources of supply in the marketplace.  Therefore, pre-determined requirements do not exist.  One intended outcome of the Government’s seeking information from industry and available products will be the determination of requirements.  Thus, no requirements are available now nor will any be available in the short term until the end of an initial Test and Evaluation cycle. 2)	This is a Request for INFORMATION. 3)	Delete the sentence “If responding to both immediate and near-term provide a separate and separatable response for each system.” 4)	Classified information should be sent to the following address:  beardjs@navsea.navy.smil.mil.  This address is for classified information only.  All other responses and information should be sent to the address set forth in the original RFI. 5)	The minimum definition of “portable” for the purposes of this RFI is that they can be mounted into and removed from motor vehicles in the field. 6)	Delete requirements for information concerning “programmable CREW test devices that will indicate that the operating condition of these CREW systems”, “Programmable Test Device”, and “cost estimate for…two (2) Programmable Test Device”.   Requests for information concerning this capability will be handled separately. 7)	The Government has no specific information on a “standard” vehicle type.  Consequently, size, dimension (HxWxD), weight, volume, form and fit, available vehicle power, antenna mounting area and restrictions are not available. 8)	No pre-determine number of threats to which the system must respond are established at this time.  Hard requirements do not exist.  There is additional value in the ability to respond to as many threats as possible, over as wide of a range as possible.  These requirements, when finalized, will be classified. 9)	The CTP is a control protocol that enables collocated active and reactive CREW systems to operate concurrently. 10)	Electronic submission of responses is acceptable. 11)	There are no known subcontracting possibilities or list of Prime Contractors for this RFI. 12)	The due date for the responses for the RFI is changed to 10 AM Eastern [Day-light savings] Time on 11 JULY 06.

<DESC>See www.epa.gov/etib for Modification 1 to the Request for Quote.  The attached questions and answers amend the RFQ as appropriate and are now part   of the RFQ.  All other terms, including timeframes, remain unchanged.  Final   questions and answers, if any, will be posted no later than Tuesday, July 11,   2006.  This RFQ was formerly identified as RFQ-DC-05-00355.     AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION 1.	The attachment entitled "7/6/06 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS" has been added.  The text is as follows:  U.S ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Expanding the Industry base (ETIB) blanket purchase agreement (BPA) PR-HQ-06-15070 (previously RFQ-DC-05-00355) Questions and Answers Question #1:  Can you modify the RFQ with regards to the term ?Certified Industrial Hygienist? in order to include experienced Industrial Hygienists or Registered Professional Industrial Hygienists of the American Professional Industrial Hygiene Association? 	Answer #1:  The RFQ is modified to include Certified Industrial Hygienists or the equivalent in regards to certification, experience, education, and/or membership in a professional organization. Question #2:  Can a company submit a quote for a labor category/line item that is not listed in the RFQ?    	Answer #2:  No, that portion of such a quote would be considered nonresponsive.  Question #3:  How many awards will the EPA make?  	Answer #3:  The number of awards made per line item will depend upon the number and content of the quotes received.   Question #4:  Are teams that incorporate a Small Business, an 8(a) company, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and a Large Business preferable to making an award to one company?  	Answer #4:  The EPA has no preference.  Please note that the socio-economic status of the prime contractor is the relevant status for the line items? socio-economic set-aside categories. Question #5:  If a team approach is chosen, does one of the team members need to be designated the prime contractor?  Or, if the team is comprised of companies with different socioeconomic statuses (e.g., 8(a), SDVOSB), can the team submit quotes for all line items in all the applicable set-aside categories? 	Answer #5:  One entity needs to be the prime with whom the EPA actually holds the BPA.  The socioeconomic category of that entity is the one that counts.  Of course, some categories are subsets of others, in which case the company qualifies for both (e.g., an 8(a) is also a small business). Question #6:  Is the three-page limit for items a ? f of the RFQ per line item or does the page limitation apply to a company?s entire submission?   	Answer #6:  The three-page limit applies per line item.  Therefore, a company submitting quotes for two line items can submit three pages for each of the two line items addressed (for a total of six pages).     Question #7:  Under Section 6, Evaluation Criteria, do the listed criteria have a weight distribution (percentage)? 	Answer #7:  The criteria have been given no specific weight; however, they are listed in the order of importance. Question #8:  If awarded a BPA under this solicitation, will there be a competition between all vendors that were awarded a BPA for a particular line item? 	Answer #8:  The intent of awarding to multiple firms per line item is to have the ability to rotate work among available vendors as outlined in Section 4, BPA Ordering Procedure, of the RFQ:  ?Under this BPA, work may be allocated among multiple vendors per line item.  Allocation of work will be based on a vendor?s availability, capacity, response speed, and equitable distribution among vendors.?   Question #9:  Which size standard applies to NAICS code 562910: $13 Million or 500 employees? 	Answer #9:  The size standard for the ETIB BPA is 500 employees.  The SBA outlines its exception to the $13 million size standard as follows:  ?the general purpose . . . must be to restore a contaminated environment and also the procurement must be composed of activities in three or more separate industries with separate NAICS codes.?  In this case, the RFQ line items define multiple separate industries, of which the combined purpose is environmental restoration.  See: http://www.sba.gov/size/sizetable2002.html#fn14.  Question #10:  Can the EPA send me a list of small businesses interested in this procurement?   	Answer #10:  The EPA cannot release that information.    Question #11:  Section 4, BPA Ordering Procedure, indicates that all the EPA regions may order work from this BPA.  Does this mean that the regions will need to put funding into the BPA before they can order work?   	Answer #11:  Yes, that is correct.   Question #12:  Are electronic email submissions allowed? 	Answer #12:  Yes. Question #13:  If a company is a small business subcontractor under a START contract, is the company precluded from submitting a quote under this RFQ? 	Answer #13:  Yes, pursuant to Section 1, Description, of the RFQ. Question #14:  This BPA consists of many response action tasks.  If a BPA is awarded to a vendor, does this preclude that vendor from bidding on work where there is a response action restriction? 	Answer #14:  Generally speaking, any activities under the BPA would not result in a waiver of any existing response action restrictions, e.g., a vendor being restricted from participating in both the site investigation and the response work.  Question #15:  Can years of experience replace degree requirements? 	Answer #15:  No.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to the University of Colorado, 3100 Marine Street, Room 481, Boulder CO 80309-0572.  This purchase order is for enhancements to the Hydrologic Database (HDB) Calculation Application and HDB training from the University of Colorado Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems (CU-CADSWES).  CADSWES will 1) analyze the computational processor user and design specifications within HDB and 2) provide HDB training. Since 1993, Reclamation, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the U.S. Geological Survey, and CADSWES have participated in a collaborative research and development program to develop Decision Support tools for water management.  Two major applications from this program are used by Boulder City Operations Office (BCOO):  RiverWare, a generalized river and reservoir simulation system, and HDB, a river and reservoir data management system.  These software systems are integral to the daily scheduling and monitoring of water deliveries for the Lower Colorado River System.  Annually,  approximately 9 million acre-feet of water are scheduled and released from Lake Mead to meet the delivery orders of water entitlement holders in the U.S. and for 1944 Water Treaty deliveries to Mexico.  The scheduling and monitoring of this volume of water via a system of dams, powerplants and diversion canals requires that RiverWare and the HDB be operational at all times. CADSWES developed, enhances, and maintains these packages for the users and is, therefore, the only entity able to provide these services. This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is July 17, 2006.  Questions may be directed to Leslie Leavitt at (702) 293-8642 or e-mail to:  lleavitt@lc.usbr.gov.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611310 and the size standard is six million dollars.

As part of that Market Survey, the FAA included a Problem Statement the last paragraph of which stated: "Public Website:  In order to facilitate vendors with particular expertise learning about the expertise of others, the FAA will maintain on its public website a list of interested vendors and their capabilities.  Vendors interested in being placed on the website should e-mail the contracting officer at nathan.tash@faa.gov with the vendor's name, point of contact with phone number and e-mail, the URL for the vendor's company (if available), and a short (no more than 25 words) description of the vendor's area of expertise.  The public website will be updated as frequently as possible." In accordance with that paragraph, the attached list includes all such vendors that have requested inclusion.   NOTE:  The attached list is not an endorsement by the FAA in any way of any vendor and merely reflects the information exactly as provided by the interested vendors.  The FAA has not verified the accuracy of the information provided by the vendors.

<DESC>A. Background:  The short-term National Capacity Development (NCD) program, which was established under the Department of State’s Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO), is an initiative that supports the broader U.S. Mission efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Government of Iraq (GOI) to more effectively meet the needs of the Iraqi people. Under the strategic direction of the Joint Executive Steering Committee (JESC) and guidance from the Ministerial Advisory Teams (MATs), the NCD Program ensures the effective integration of the Mission’s overall national capacity development objectives.

B.  Full Text of Announcement.  The Office of Development of the IRMO is requesting market research information in the form of white papers (see instructions below) from Industry for innovative solutions to obtain services and specified deliverables to support capacity development in key Iraqi Government ministries. The draft Statements of Work (SOWs) for two key ministries, Health and Finance, are published and available for viewing and downloading on http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net.  Additional draft SOWs may be developed requiring the same market research information outlined in this notice.  When available, these documents will be announced as modifications to this notice with the concurrent publishing of the draft SOWs on the rebuilding Iraq website.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal; a Request for Quotation; an Invitation for Bids; a solicitation; or an indication the Regional Contracting Office (RCO) Baghdad will contract for items contained in the RFI. The RCO Baghdad will not pay respondents for information in response to this RFI. This constitutes the first step in a short-term Iraqi National Capacity Development effort.  The synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  A contract will not be awarded as a result of this announcement.

C.  White Papers.  Interested parties are encouraged to submit white papers.  The white papers are generally no more than five pages describing recommended execution approaches (including estimated cost and schedule).  These papers are intended to assist IRMO in capacity development for Iraqi ministries.  The white paper must contain as a minimum:  Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Price, Company Address, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact, Phone, Fax & Email, Task Objective, Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables.  White papers can focus on all or part of the tasks outlined in the draft SOWs.  Also, if common tasks are requested in one or more SOWs (e.g. Contract Management, Budget Management), responder can submit white paper for a multi-ministerial program.  Submit white papers as soon as possible but no later than two (2) weeks from the date of this announcement.  Multiple white papers addressing different need areas, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by each offeror.  All Iraqi businesses should identify themselves as such. Interested offerors shall also identify any known or potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) that may arise and state what plans are in effect to mitigate this conflict.  Additionally, offerors submitting white papers are responsible for identifying and properly marking proprietary information included in their submittals.


The white paper must be formatted as follows:

Section A - .  Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Price of Task, Name and address of the Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact, Telephone Number, Fax and Email.    
 
Section B - Task Objective - Description of work to be performed

Section C - Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables

The white paper should include the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) price.  It is a best guess of the anticipated price of the effort.  The ROM should be consistent with the level of work being proposed.

White papers are not considered binding offers. A formal Request for Proposal will be advertised for all efforts required. Questions and suggestions on the draft statements of work are encouraged also.

Requirements: 20mm Cannon design must be compatible with the A/A49E-7(V4) turret system and aircraft hardware/software configurations as well as be backwards compatible with the AH-1W.  It is desired that no aircraft or turret modifications be required.  In addition, it is also required that no additional aircrew or maintenance personnel training be required. Other requirements not directly related to the physical interface with the aircraft will be addressed at a later date.  Examples of such requirements include technical publications, supply support, depot service level agreements, and other important considerations.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, the contractor is encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.  Specifically, the cannon shall:
a.  Weight shall be &#8804;132 Pounds (60 kg) 
b. Rates of Fire Up shall be (low) 600 to (high)1,500 Shots Per Minute
c. Dispersion &#8804;5.0 Milliradians Diameter, 80 Percent Circle (PGU Series Ammunition)  
d. Muzzle Velocity: &#61619;3,380 Feet (1,030m) Per Second.
e. Utilize 20mm linked or bulk ammunition.

Sample Response Letter:  The following is a suggested outline for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service is seeking information related to its fleet vehicle ownership.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does it imply one will be issued.  The Forest Service intends to assess the capabilities of the market place to provide a portion of the agency’s fleet.  If the Government decides to issue a RFP, the solicitation would likely be issued in FY 2007.  In addition, the Government would anticipate utilizing a 5-year contract (one 1-year Base Period with four 1-year Option Periods).  Any comments or concerns regarding the use of an extended contract period should be addressed in the vendor’s response to this RFI.  Please ensure that sensitive or protected information is marked as such.  The Government will not pay for, nor reimburse, any expenses incurred in responding to this RFI.

The purpose of this Request for Information is to determine the interest and capability of offerers to lease sedans, station wagons, trucks, busses and heavy equipment to the Forest Service   The Forest Service is also interested in determining possible scenarios for disposition of the current Forest Service owned fleet.


BACKGROUND

The Fleet
The Forest Service fleet includes a large variety of equipment:  The following is a partial listing of Forest Service fleet components:

INCLUDED IN THIS RFI
1.	Sedans, station wagons, light trucks such as:  pickup, van, SUV, utility, stake, dump, and others (4X2 & 4X4; 4,000 to 19,999 lbs. GVWR), etc.  Ten to fifteen percent of these vehicles are only used (and needed) for summer/seasonal use.  This is the largest component of the Forest Service fleet.
2.	Medium and heavy trucks such as: stock, stakes, dumps, vans, truck tractors, etc.  
3.	Busses
4.	Heavy equipment such as: tractors/dozers, loaders, backhoes, compactors, excavators, feller bunchers, masticators, motor graders, soil stabilizers, agriculture tractors, etc.
NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RFI
5.	Lawn mowers, motor cycles, ATVs, boats, motors, etc.
6.	Trailers such as: light duty utility trailers, horse trailers, platform trailers (level deck, drop deck, and tilt deck), dry van trailers, house/office trailers, and specialized trailers (lab, command center, communication), etc.
7.	Shop/warehouse equipment such as: forklifts, hoists, transport dollies, generators, etc.

Some of the sedans, station wagons and trucks are specialized vehicles such as law enforcement vehicles, fire trucks, crew carriers, helicopter tenders, boom trucks, tree shakers, mobile labs, etc.

The current Forest Service fleet includes equipment/vehicles owned by the Forest Service (93%), leased from the General Services Administration (GSA) (7%), and leased from commercial sources (less than 0.1%)


Location

The fleet equipment is located at more than a 1,000 locations throughout the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  Many locations are remote with limited local sources.  Some remote locations, especially in Alaska, are only accessible by air or water craft. The fleet must be supported at incident camps which are established as close to the incident (like a wild land fire) as possible.  This support must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the incident.

Operating Conditions

The Forest Service frequently operates its fleet equipment off paved roads, on native soil roads that are not maintained for public or passenger car use, and in off-road, primitive conditions.  All vehicles and equipment, especially the specialized vehicles, may be operated off roads during fire and other emergency response under adverse operating conditions exceeding the manufactures extreme duty maintenance definitions.  Fleet equipment will, at times, be operated in all weather conditions including severe conditions such as floods, hurricanes, ice storms and extreme heat.  Normal wear and tear may include some minor damage to exterior surfaces and damage caused by rodents and other animals.

Added Equipment

Most fleet vehicles will require the installation of added equipment such as: radios, antennas, emergency lights, sirens, fire extinguishers, first aid kits, fire tool brackets, tool boxes, racks, cargo screens, etc.  These installations require drilling holes or other minor damage to the vehicle.  Special painting and marking are required on Forest Service fleet vehicles.  In addition, some modifications must be after delivery such as adding of hydraulic cranes, snowplows, or winches which may include modifying the chassis to accommodate installation, additional weight, etc. 

Seasonal Use

Seasonal work varies greatly from year to year.  The Forest Service is able to holdover replaced vehicles for two or more additional seasons before the replaced vehicles are sold.  This allows the Forest Service to increase or decrease the fleet by about 2,000 vehicles in any one year as needed.  Because these “holdovers” are fully depreciated, the units that use them pay reduced rates.  These are vehicles available as needed for our summer/seasonal crews.  

Fleet Credit Cards

All fleet motor vehicles have a fleet credit card assigned to the vehicle for the procurement of fuel and minor maintenance and repairs.  The cards have: nationwide acceptance at fuel and maintenance locations, the ability to bill net of exempted taxes, pin number security, and provide level 3 product information.

Inventory and Data Reporting

Detailed inventories of fleet equipment are kept as required by the Property Management Regulations and as needed to satisfy other applicable external (outside USDA) reporting requirements such as OMB circular A11, the Energy Policy Act, and Executive Orders.  In addition to information about the physical equipment, the following types of information are required: miles or hours of use, quantity and type of fuel used, the FS administrative unit and subunit the vehicle is assigned, the location (city, state, & zip code), and codes showing if equipment is primarily used for law enforcement, fire, emergency response, or emergency response support. 

Maintenance and Repair

All vehicles are included in a preventative maintenance program that includes pre-use, monthly, and annual mechanical safety inspections with follow-up maintenance and repair as needed to assure the equipment is safe and operational.  All applicable State and local safety and environmental inspection requirements must be met.  


DELIVERABLES AND OBJECTIVES

Among the specific deliverables of interest for this request are the following:

Vehicles and equipment:  (All vehicles must comply with the Federal Vehicle Standard 122 for Automobiles, Sedans, and Station Wagons; and Federal Vehicle Standard 307 for Light Trucks, 4X2 & 4X4; 4,000 to 19,999 gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).  (Published by GSA and available at gsa.gov) 
	
1.	Provide approximately 12,000 sedans, station wagons, and light trucks (4X2 & 4X4; 4,000 to 19,999 GVWR) for year-round use..
2.	Provide from 1,000 to 4,000 vehicles for summer/seasonal use, depending on need.
3.	Provide approximately 8,000 medium and heavy trucks, including specialized vehicles (fire trucks, crew carriers, lab trucks, etc.)
4.	Provide approximately 60 busses.
5.	Provide approximately 1,000 pieces of heavy equipment: tractors/dozers, loaders, backhoes, compactors, excavators, forest machines, motor graders, soil stabilizers, etc

<SUBJECT>D -- Briefing on Enterprise Architecture
<DESC>SUBMIT ALL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS TO Yvette.Gibson@gsa.gov. NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL BE ANSWERED BY PHONE.
The Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office invites you to attend a briefing for companies with Enterprise Architecture products and practices on Thursday, July 13, 2006 to discuss the Federal Transition Framework.  Richard Burk, Chief Architect, Office of Management and Budget, will give the briefing.   It will be held from 1:30p.m. – 3:00 p.m. at the George Washington University (Continental Ballroom) Marvin Center - 800 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 
The Federal Transition Framework (FTF) is a single information source for cross-agency information technology (IT) initiatives using a simple, familiar and organized structure. It contains government-wide IT policy objectives and cross-agency initiatives including OMB-sponsored initiatives, like E-Gov and LoB initiatives, and Government-wide initiatives, like Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12). By having a single source of information, agencies will receive more consistent, complete and detailed information about cross-agency initiatives more quickly to inform their enterprise architecture, capital planning and implementation activities. The Federal Government will also be able to increase the level and speed of adoption of cross-agency initiatives and increase the sharing and reuse of common, cross-agency business processes, service components and technology standards. 
This meeting will provide a presentation of the FTF catalog, metamodel, and usage guide.  The presentation will be followed by both a general and technical discussion.
 Enterprise Architecture tool vendors are encouraged to attend and discuss their interest in incorporating the FTF into their product.
 The agenda will be:
1:00 p.m.– 1:30 p.m. – Registration 
1:30 p.m. – 2:00 p.m. – FTF Presentation, Dick Burk

<SUBJECT>A--COMMERCIAL ORBITAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES (COTS) SPACE FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS
<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to solicit proposals from industry for Earth to orbit space flight demonstrations of any combination of the following mission capabilities:  Period 1  a) External unpressurized cargo delivery and disposal,  b) Internal pressurized cargo delivery and disposal,  c) Internal pressurized cargo delivery, return and recovery.  Option Period 2  d) Crew Transportation.  Period 1 demonstration(s) will culminate with a rendezvous and docking or berthing with the International Space Station and either disposal or reentry and recovery, depending on the selected mission.  Proposals will also be solicited for mission capability d), crew transportation, but only as an option to Period 1 proposals for mission capability c) as listed above. The Period 2 demonstrations will consist of one or more crewed missions to the International Space Station. The option will be considered for execution only after the successful demonstration of Period 1 mission capability c).  The objective of these space flight capability demonstrations is to stimulate commercial enterprises in space and lead to innovative, cost effective access to low-Earth orbit. It is anticipated that upon the successful demonstration of any one of the mission capabilities prior to 2010 timeframe, NASA may issue a request for proposals to competitively procure commercial orbital transportation services to resupply the International Space Station. NASA anticipates that these services will be needed through at least 2015.  NASA intends to use its Space Act authority or other non-FAR authority to enter into funded agreements resulting from this announcement. One or more initial agreements are anticipated.  Because a purpose of this investment is to facilitate commercial orbital transportation service capabilities for, in part, U.S. Government use, responders need to be aware that in making awards, NASA is constrained by statutory and U.S. space transportation policy requirements. NASA anticipates releasing a draft of our announcement on or about November 22, 2005. The draft announcement briefing at NASA Johnson Space Center is tentatively planned for November 29, 2005. Additional information regarding the draft announcement briefing will be forthcoming. Comments on the draft will be due on December 06, 2005. Final issuance of the announcement will be on or about December 20, 2005. Responses will be due on January 27, 2006, and final agreements are planned to be executed in May 2006.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENET TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES FOR BEYOND GOLDWATER-NICHOLS REFORMS
<DESC>The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) performed the first, second, and third year of this work as directed by Congress which began in FY04. The current task from Congress looks to continue Phase I which focused on Planning-Program ming-Budgeting-Execution System (PBBES), and Phase II focused on the defense acquisition system.  Both efforts were in parallel with DoD reform efforts, the 2004 Aldridge study entitled Joint Defense Capabilities Study; Improving DoD Strategic Planning, Re sourcing and Execution to Satisfy Joint Capabilities; the August 2003 Defense Science Board on Enabling Joint Capabilities and DSB's summer 2004 study on Defense Transformation; and the 2005 Defense Acquisition Process Assessment (DAPA) study concluded by creating the DoD QDR Execution Roadmap task force on DoD Institutional Reform and Governance.  Statement of work - The goal of Beyond Goldwater-Nichols is to develop actionable recommendations for defense reform.  The original Goldwater-Nichols Act helped the Department of Defense overcome the organizational and policy changes needed to ensure that in ten to fifteen years, the DoD will have the right capabilities, and enough of them, to cope with the challenges of that time. Tasks under the contract include compressively review recent assessments of post 9/11 security environments and identify areas of agreement and disagreement.  Building on the Institute of Defense Analysis ICCARM work, the BG-N study will then develop an alternative approach that links illustrative future military postures and their associated methodological approach with selected former senior-level policymakers. CSIS will closely track and provide independent assessments of recent PPBES developments, such as the Defense Business Systems Management Committee (DBSMC) and its Enterprise Transition Plan, the creation of the Defense Bu siness Transformation Agency, the evolving role of the Combatant Commands through the Senior War fighting Forum (SWarF), the portfolio management approach to joint capability areas, and the recent emphasis given by the Joint Requirements Oversight Counsel to the most pressing military issues.  While the DSB Task Force focused, among other things on where the National Nuclear Security Administration should be organizationally situated, CSIS will focus on  DOD's stewardship of the nuclear mission in the post 9/11 world.  CSIS will assess the implications of post 9/11 developments with respect to nuclear issues, address how U.S. requirements for nuclear weapons should be defined and resourced and make recommendations for how DoD and USG should be organized for the nuclear mission. CSIS will examine a range of questions, including roles and missions as well as authorities and organizational structures associated with developing unity of effort across the U.S. Government, and with State and local governments, and in the homeland secur ity mission area. Second CSIS will evaluate how to best define the role of the DoD in response to catastrophic disasters, and its relationship in that context to non-DoD entities. The contract work is expected to take one year from the date of contract award. Performance shall be principally at the contractors facility with periodic visits to the Pentagon and other DoD required facilities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The Government intends to award a sole-source contract to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for this work. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO RFP WILL BE  AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. Organizations that believe they possess the capability necessary to undertake the work described should submit their capabilities package by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, July 21, 2006. No extensions will be granted. Firms capab ility statement should be as complete a package as possible. Specify services that can be provided and include your r esource capabilities as well. The capability package should demonstrate firms ability to perform the specific tasks that are being requested in the Statement of Work. Point of Contact: Email your questions to Army Contracting Agency, ITEC4 at nellie.potoc ki-reeves@itec4.army.mil or susan.klypchak@itec4.army.mil.

 The USCG Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) Portsmouth, VA has a requirement to purchase: a total of 120 each Beacon Signal Generator.

  1200-SMSK-PIVIAFE Digital Global Position System (DGPS) Beacon Signal Generator

The 1200~SMSK-PMAFE is the signal generation module of the MR-1O1 enhanced DGPS medium frequency data modulator.  This module accepts signals from a DSP card PMAFE interface and generates a Shaped MSK modulated data at user selectable data rates and carrier frequency.  The 1200-SMSK-PMAFE timing is based on either an internal or an external 10 MHz frequency reference that may be both time and frequency synchronized to an external One-PPS pulse from GPS. The l200-SMSK-PMAFE is designed to operate with a companion DSP card, for example, the Momentum Data Systems HAWK89 board, hosted on a PC PCI bus. This combination permits control of the modulation process and the generation of the desired data message.

To permit immediate testing of the 1200-SMSK-PMAFE, the cards are shipped with SMSK modulator test software. This Windows® based program generates a phase modulated carrier using standard RTCM SC 104 formatted 6-of-8 formatted messages or fixed internally generated test messages. 

1200-SMSK-PMAFE specifications when interfaced with the HA WK89 DSP card (MRD-101) and CEI control software

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Integrated Genomics, Inc. for the manual pathway identification for the Coxiella in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #6038. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11 dated 7/5/2006. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories(RML), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens.  SCHEDULE: The contractor shall provide to RML services to construct and provide automated pathway identification tools, manual curation, identification of additional pathways, perform chromosomal clustering, increase the percentage of annotated genes.  The contractor shall also provide a complete list of pathways and biochemical processes in the form of a report and data upload to the patented Integrated Genomics ERGO server located at RML that describe the functional and metabolic potential of the organism with respect to acid requirements and extracellular growth. This is a 6-week, one time work effort, where the final product shall be the production of report outlining the details of the metabolic nature of Coxiella and a data upload to the RML ERGO server.  The contractor shall work with the  ERGO database server infrastructure and perform functional assignments of Coxiella genes within their respective pathways. Pathways for all functional roles shall be identified.  Genes that appear to be locally missing shall be reconsidered by surveying the pathway collection for the organism and identifying additional pathways believed to be part of the organism’s metabolic catalog.  These efforts shall focus on pathways in Coxiella for which not all steps can be associated with identified genes, but where comparable pathways located in other organisms provides a framework for identifying missing members within the Coxiella pathways.  Chromosomal clustering shall also be a tool that the contractor shall use for identifying the function for hypothetical proteins.  The result of this effort shall be a complete list of pathways and biochemical processes that describe the basic functional and metabolic profile of Coxiella.  Metabolic reconstruction shall be derived by interconnecting the entire set of pathways.  This interconnection shall be based upon the ERGO metabolic pathway collection, a survey of the literature relating to the known metabolic and physiological properties of the organism. The contractor shall perform several rounds of manual annotation.  The metabolic reconstruction process shall provide a foundation of information for media design and optimization.  The work performed shall focus on understanding 1) the molecular basis of acid resistance for growth, 2) identifying the molecular genetic basis for the obligate intracellularity of the organism.  Both efforts shall involve examining aspects of central metabolism for the organism defined, but not limited to, carbohydrate, amino acid, coenzyme, cofactor, bioenergetics, stress and transport system metabolism.  Deliverables shall include the following:  Manual pathway curation of Coxiella and targeted reconstruction focused on acid requirements and obligate intracellularity. Revised genomic pathway and annotation data shall be added to the RML ERGO server by secure upload.  A report shall be generated describing the findings from the reconstruction process.  This report shall include information on key pathways in central metabolism that are incomplete or missing completely and which may contribute to acid requirement or obligate intracellular growth of Coxiella. This report shall also contain data on suggestions regarding growth conditions that may support the extracellular growth of the organism. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Program Management and Analysis Program (IRM/OPS/PMA).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government?s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco 4506 switches have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco 4506 Switch as a key component of the Department's networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State?s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department?s requirements as a key component of the Department?s networking system.  The Cisco 4506 Switch has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec) B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C) Seller is providing these products via Cisco authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales. D) Full Cisco warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. To bid on this item, Sellers must be Cisco Gold or Cisco Silver Certified Federal Resellers. No Exceptions.

DOS established hardware standards based on the requirements of the financial applications that we support.  Some of the those applications produce printed output that is coded to print on specific printers (by manufacturer and model).  The printers requested fall into that area of requirement.  By purchasing specific printers we eliminate the time, cost, and expense (in software developers time) to recode and retest the same output on different (new) printers. DOS found a significant &quot;side benefit&quot; of standardizing our printer hardware (in addition to the cost savings noted above) in the money savings we experience in toner cartridge purchasing.  As all of our printers use only  three different print cartridges.  Introducing other models will not allow us to experience the cost savings we currently enjoy for bulk purchasing Print output continuity via redundancy i.e.  our users are able to route their print jobs to any one of several different printers.  AS each printer is configured in the same way (because they are the same make of printer), no changes need to be made to the output selection.  The users are guaranteed to get the same output from each printer (of the same type, of course) A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. *NO COMPATIBLES.

<DESC>The purposes of this Amendment are to provide a response to another question received and to extend the due date for quotations.

Question:  In your response to the recent site visit, you address in question 3 [in Amendment 0002 to this RFQ] an accumulator.  Since I believe there is no reference to an accumulator in the "Minimum requirements for CLIN 0001" I have to assume that this is something NIST will incorporate into the system.

Answer: The installation of the accumulator is not specifically addressed in the requirements section of the RFQ.  However, if the Offeror feels that the accumulator can be used in their proposed servo-hydraulic upgrade, then NIST will make the accumulator available to them for incorporation in the hydraulic system.
