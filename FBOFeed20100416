<DESC><p>Solicitation Number: <br />FA8615-10-R-6048</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Presolicitation</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>Light Air Support (LAS) Aircraft</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION: The Air Force is planning to acquire a Light Air Support (LAS) aircraft for use by the Afghanistan National Army Air Corps (ANAAC) and other future customers. The fixed-wing platform will be used for conducting advanced flight training, aerial reconnaissance and light attack operations. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) previously conducted a market research assessment of production-ready, weapons-certified, fixed-wing platforms available for a cost-effective acquisition program. The responses received by ASC to the October 30, 2009, Sources Sought Synopsis, FA8615-10-R-ZZ01, for the ANAAC Advanced Flight Trainer / Light Attack Aircraft (AFT/LAA) assisted in determining the planned acquisition strategy for the LAS aircraft.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION STRATEGY: This procurement will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, as supplemented. ASC is planning for a draft RFP to be released and posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps, accessible at https://www.fbo.gov) by 28 May 2010. After it is released, potential offerors will have ten (10) working days to provide written comments and questions to the Contracting Officer. All comments and questions will be considered in development of the final RFP. Once the final RFP is released, offerors will have 45 or 60 days to provide proposals for a full and open competitive source selection evaluation. The Air Force anticipates evaluating proposals using a tradeoff process considering mission capability, risk, past performance, and price. The tradeoff will be conducted as described in Air Force FAR Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, available at:<br />http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/af_afmc/affars/5315.htm</p>
<p>The LAS program is anticipating awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with an estimated five (5) year ordering period. For planning purposes, ASC currently anticipates six (6) aircraft, with options for approximately fourteen (14) additional aircraft for use by ANAAC. Additional orders may be awarded based on future customer requirements that are within the technical and contractual scope of the LAS aircraft contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS: LAS aircraft must be a non-developmental item (NDI) that is production-ready. No development or testing funds are available. The aircraft, as proposed, must be capable of USAF military certification. Time required for certification will need to be factored into production and delivery schedules. The LAS aircraft will be a single-engine, turbo-prop, tandem- and ejection-seat cockpit, pressurized aircraft with retractable, tricycle gear capable of operations from austere airfields with semi-improved (dirt, grass, gravel) landing surfaces. Additional aircraft technical requirements remain the same as stated in the October 30, 2009, Sources Sought Synopsis, FA8615-10-R-ZZ01, for the ANAAC Advanced Flight Trainer / Light Attack Aircraft (AFT/LAA).<br /><br />The RFP will also specify requirements for on-site aircraft logistics support, maintenance, and air advisor (USAF or NATO pilots) training. Aircrew training devices (computer-based training, part-task trainers and Flight Training Devices (FTDs) with visual displays but motion not required) will also be specified for delivery.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Written comments and questions responding to this synopsis are also welcome, and may, in this instance, be directed either to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist, both identified below.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this presolicitation that is properly marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition strategy.

Comments and questions will be answered to the maximum reasonable extent, and will be posted, together with the Government's responses, on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this is not an IFB or RFP. It is not a solicitation of any kind. It is not intended to be the basis of any award. It is for planning and informational purposes only. The Government is not bound by it. No proposals or promotional materials should be prepared or submitted in its response.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective TechnolotyLaboratory, (NPPTL) hereby announces its intent to issue a Purchase Order to Ocence, Inc. to procure Ocenco M-20 and EBA 6.5 Self Contained, Sel-Rescuers (SCSR).<br />Purpose and Objective: to procure Ocenco M-20 and EBA 6.5 Self Contained Self-Rescuers (SCSR) for testing and evaluating, in the NIOSH Long-Term Field Evaluation.<br />Project Background: In order to minimize the probability of SCSR failures and subsequent miner deaths, NIOSH and it predecessor have conducted a program entitled: the Long Term Field Evaluation Program (LTFE), This Program has been in place since the introduction of SCSRs (over 20 years). Each year, NIOSH collects deployed SCSRs from active mines across the country and replaces those devices with new units of the same model and manufacturer. The number of each type collected is determined by their portion of the total population of SCSRs in use. Replacing the collected SCSRs with units of the same kind is required/necessiary since each manufacturer's unit operates differently and miners at that mine must be trained on the specific device. Mixing of different models of SCSR at any mine would cause confusion amnd increase probability of death in an emergency. The collected SCSRs are taken to the National Personnel Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) when they are inspected and evaluated for their life support capacity. This program has identified many unexpected failures over the years of operation and have resulted in recalls of SCSRs and improved SCSR design. Miners' lives have been saved by units that would likely have failed if not upgraded due to the LTFE Program.<br />Responsible Sources that belive they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.

The website is www.ccr.gov.<br />The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used soley for the purpose of determininig whether to conduct a competitive procurment.<br />If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.103-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Ocenco, Inc., 10225 82nd Street, Pleasant Prairie, WI 53158, as the only source ans a Purchase Order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.<br />

PROJECT DETAILS: The Beartooth Highway in Wyoming begins at the Wyoming/Montana State Line east of Cooke City, Montana, following US 212 for 56.1 kilometers to the Wyoming/Montana State Line southwest of Red Lodge, Montana. The project is located entirely within the Shoshone National Forest. The project begins at approximately Mile Post 26 immediately west of Beartooth Lake Outlet Bridge, and ends at approximately Mile Post 27.7 immediately west of Little Bear Creek. The project is located in remote, environmentally sensitive high alpine terrain (in excess of 9,000 feet) with a very limited construction season (4 to 5 months per year), and must be completed in 2011. Considerable attention to detail is required in project construction due the historical eligibility of the existing roadway and bridges. 

The base schedule, Schedule A, for this project consists of the removal of the existing Beartooth Lake Outlet Bridge, and reconstructing a new structure, with approaches totaling 0.4 mile, immediately adjacent to, and partially over, the existing bridge. The existing bridge can be partially used for maintenance of traffic, and is required to be deconstructed in an extremely careful manner in order to preserve the existing stone masonry for reuse on the new structure, and limit turbidity in Beartooth Creek. Schedule A will also contain the construction of a historic bridge interpretive site, parking area, and access trail, as well as reconstruction of the Beartooth Lake Campground approach road intersection. The principal work items on the base schedule include: lump sum contractor testing, lump sum construction schedule, 3,500 m3 roadway excavation, 7,700 m3 unclassified borrow, 6,000 t aggregate base, 1,350 t superpave pavement, 124 m precast, prestressed concrete girders, 46,750 kg reinforcing steel - epoxy coated, 260 m3 structural concrete, 830 m micropiles, 2 trial micropiles, 131 m of Guardrail system G3 - Wyoming box beam steel posts, along with associated traffic control and equipment/flagging, soil erosion control, survey and staking, pavement markings.

There are two optional schedules: (1) Option V  pre-grubbing removal of stumps, seeding and mulching, and erosion control, along a 1.2 mile extension of the eastern bridge approach; (2) Option W  grade, drain, and pave 1.2 miles of roadway predominately along the existing alignment east of the Beartooth Lake Campground approach intersection. 

Principal work items on Option V include: 200 hours each of Dump Truck, Bulldozer, Excavator, and Labor for stump removal, 4.0 ha seeding, 4.0 ha mulching, 2,400 m silt fence, and associated traffic control equipment/flagging, seeding, and mulching.

Principal work items on Option W include: lump sum contractor testing, lump sum construction schedule, 27,500 m3 roadway excavation, 5,100 m3 unclassified borrow, 14,000 t aggregate base, 3,650 t superpave pavement, 1,450 m asphalt curb, 450 m of guardrail system G4 (w-beam steel posts), 5.4 ha seeding, 4.6 ha mulching, along with associated traffic control and equipment/flagging, soil erosion control, survey and staking, pavement markings.

It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in early May with construction beginning in 2010 and extending up to two construction seasons.

Estimated cost for the base schedule and both options is $6.0 to $15.0 million.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) requests proposals for the provision  of Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) Evaluation Reports based on evaluations of ecosystems and/or lands of various FWS National Wildlife Refuges nationwide using HGM methodology. These reports will include ecosystem restoration and management options for ecosystems and/or lands of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The size of the documents will vary based on the size and complexity of the ecosystem and or the individual refuge, and may require multiple tasks and or volumes. The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, materials and transportation necessary to complete each task identified. This solicitation announcement is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Provided there are enough qualified/responsible small business firms responding there is the potential that a multiple award task order contract will be awarded. Contract performance period will be a one-year base period plus four one-year option periods. The total performance period will be 60 months if all options are exercised. The minimum guarantee is $10,000.00 per contract over the life of each contract. Task Order minimum and maximum limits are $3,000.00 and $200,000.00 respectively. The "estimated" maximum (non-guaranteed) dollar value for each contract is $5,000,000.00 over five-years. Task Orders could range in magnitude from $2,000.00 up to $200,000.00 per job.
Evaluations of conservation and management strategies for ecosystems in North America have evolved to incorporate information, and base landscape-scale decisions, on: 1) formative processes and basic structural properties including geomorphology, soils, and topography; 2) basic ecological processes that created and sustained communities especially hydrology, disturbance mechanisms, and community dynamics; and 3) relative degree and type of alteration to structure and processes.  This landscape-scale evaluation is embodied within the contemporary "Hydrogeomorphic methodological (HGM)" approach.   The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620 and the size standard is $7.0 million. This is a total set aside for small business. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered. 
Solicitation number 60181AQ028 will be posted in approximately 17 days and may be viewed through a link to the National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at "http://www.fedbizopps.gov" or "http://www.nbc.gov". 
Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and complete Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) at "http://www.bpn.gov".
Availability of Solicitation documents and specifications is anticipated to be on or about May 3, 2010.

<DESC>The Vaccine Branch of the National Cancer Institute, Division of Center for Cancer Research, proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Advanced Bioscience Laboratories, Inc. This requirement will provide for an extension for a four months period for support services for investigations related to development of vaccines for prevention of retroviral infection, development of treatment strategies for AIDS, and elucidation of mechanisms of retroviral pathogenesis.
<p>Advanced Biosciences Laboratories, Inc. has been under contract (N02-RC-57701) to the National Cancer Institute since 2001 to support pre-clinical studies in non-human primates and standard laboratory animals by providing maintenance of the animals, through required quarantine periods and during performance of experiments, in accordance with all animal welfare regulations.</p>
<p>The major tasks of the extension include the completion of the following active studies:<br />1) AMP-224. The current study is in the process of evaluating the effect of AMP-224 as not only a therapeutic agent but as a vaccine effectiveness enhancing agent.<br />2) ALVAC SIV. This ongoing study is to evaluate methods to improve the immunogenecity of ALVAC vaccines, either alone or in combination with DNA vaccine priming, using the SIV-macaque model.<br />3) ALVAC titration. This study is to develop and optimize a repeat low dose mucosal challenge using SIVmac251 and then use this method of challenge to evaluate effectiveness of an ALVAC-SIV vaccine to prevent or otherwise modulate this mucosal challenge.<br />4) HPV-2. This study is to develop and evaluate a vaccine platform that specifically targets the most prevalent route of infection by HIV.<br />5) Tat/Env. This study is to confirm earlier observations using clade C rather than clade B based immunogens.<br />6) SIV-E660 challenge. The E660 strain of SIV is being evaluated as a heterologous challenge in animals vaccinated with SIVmac251 components.<br />7) INF alpha. This study is to directly test the contribution of early, innate, IFN alpha responses at mucosal sites of infection.</p>

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  This is not a request for technical or cost proposals.  No solicitation is available at this time and requests for solicitation packages will not receive a response.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Center for Developmental Biology and Perinatal Medicine, has a requirement to develop multiplexed screening assays for newborn screening that can be automated and utilized in a high throughput environment.  NICHD is particularly interested in technologies that screen for "high priority" conditions with current or promising effective therapeutic interventions (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, severe combined immunodeficiency, lysosomal storage diseases such as Pompe disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, and the mucopolysaccharidoses), which presently lack sensitive and specific tests.  The report, "Newborn Screening:  Toward a Uniform Screening Panel and System" (httm://mchb.hrsa.gov/screening), commissioned by the Health Resources and Services Administration, identifies some of these "high priority" conditions.

A three year, cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated with an award made on or about September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will be issued on or about May 3, 2010 in an electronic format only, on this web site (https://www.fbo.gov).  Offerors are responsible for routinely checking this web site for any amendments to the solicitation.  No individual notification of amendments will be provided.  Proposals will be due sixty days after the date of the issuance of the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS 541712.

No collect telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This requirement is for contractor to provide all material, labor, and supervision and perform all work to abate asbestos on 3 West and $ West as indicated on the contract drawings and specifications at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center located at 1481 W. 10th St, Indianapolis, IN  46202.  Although the 4 West C-Wing area will be vacant during asbestos removal, the 3 West C-Wing area is an occupied area.  The abatement in this area will need to be coordinated with the hospital and a detailed abatement schedule will need to be submitted.  (Staff and patients will vacate certain rooms per a schedule approved by VA). VA can only give up approximately 2 rooms at a time for abatement in the 3 West area.  Once a particular set of rooms is abated on 3 West and clearance is received, the staff will move back into those rooms and the contractor will be given the next set of rooms and so on until the abatement is completed.  There will most likely be a day of downtime by the abatement contractor per each set of rooms until VA can get the one set of rooms house cleaned (rooms just abated) and patients moved out of the next set of rooms.  Weekend work shall be required as the 3 West ward usually has a lighter patient load over weekends and we may be able to work out giving more rooms to the abatement contractor over a weekend.  Contractor also has the option of working on the abatement on the 4th floor concurrently during downtime on the 3rd floor.

Bidders MUST ensure registration in these websites are accurate and have not expired.  Project magnitude is $25,000 - $100,000.  The NAICS code is 562910.  The solicitation documents will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about May 04, 2010.  Dissemination of the specifications is limited to electronic medium.  Drawings will be available electronically with the solicitation documents.  All interested Bidders (primes & subcontractors) should register at www.fedbizopps.gov so that others will know of your interest in participating in this procurement and for automatic receipt of updates or amendments.

<DESC>1.  GENERAL INFORMATION:

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to aid the government in determining if there is sufficient small business industrial expertise and interest to proceed with a small business set-aside, competitive procurement for the desired capability described below.  Only small businesses should reply to this announcement.


2.  BACKGROUND

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) director has directed the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) community to develop, enhance or modify current M&S capabilities and to integrate and verify, validate and analyze all element/component level representations. 

The MDA M&S vision is to apply modeling and simulation to assess and improve the capability of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to counter any ballistic missile threat, anytime, anywhere in the world. The following seven goals form the cornerstone of the plan that will be implemented by the Modeling and Simulation Directorate to meet this vision.

1.	Provide M&S capabilities that can be used to assess and improve the operational performance of the BMDS
2.	Provide M&S capabilities that can be used to accelerate engineering and integration of the BMDS
3.	Integrate M&S into BMDS operational planning, mission rehearsal, and execution
4.	Manage M&S across MDA using systems engineering processes, knowledge sharing,
5.	Define M&S metrics, and accomplish Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) assessments
6.	Establish a unity of effort for employing common practices and standards across MDA to improve credibility and performance of models and simulations
7.	Synchronize BMDS M&S with other joint, Department of Defense (DOD), and coalition organizations

The MDA Sensors Directorate (SN) is responsible for all sensor models participating in BMDS activities.  Digital and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) models will be used in support of the BMDS Performance Assessments (PAs) and the Ground Test (GT) campaigns. These sensors include SBX, AN/TPY-2 Terminal Mode (TM), AN/TPY-2 Forward-Based Mode (FBM), Cobra Dane, and Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWRs) located at Beale, Fylingdales, and Thule. Due to the complexity of the BMDS, its behavior can never be fully assessed solely based on testing of the system. M&S must be used to assess the behavior of the BMDS and to help understand how the system will perform against a wide range of potential threats and over a wide range of environmental conditions. In order to do this, MDA simulations must be able to accurately predict results that are observed in test events so that extrapolation to other cases are valid. Missile defense models and simulations are needed to provide analytical underpinnings for system design, development, and operations. To perform this role, the many individual models and simulations need to be more adequately linked and integrated at the system level with appropriate levels of fidelity. The BMDS modeling and simulation capability must represent actual and projected BMDS systems with as much accuracy and precision as necessary to satisfy the objectives of its intended uses. MDA/SN M&S overall goal is to provide Sensor representations that are VV&A'd by leveraging MDA flight test data. 

3.  REQUESTED CAPABILITY

While the X-Band Radar Development contractor will perform M&S Verification, the contractor being sought through this RFI will plan, execute, and document Validation and Analysis of the M&S.  In addition, the contractor will help support the M&S Accreditation, which will be performed by a third-party. The contractor will be required to assess the Verification & Vadidation efforts and support the Sensors Directorates certification letters to the Accreditation Agents.

The essential tasks for Validation under this effort are encompassed in Post-Flight Reconstruction (PFR) and related analyses are described below.  Key capabilities embodied in this effort are the ability to set-up and run the various HWIL and Digital Radar/Sensor Models developed for MDA.

The Post Flight Reconstruction (PFR) process is depicted in Figure 1.  This process consists of four activities: 
1.	Pre-PFR Analysis
2.	Residual Metric and Signature Bias Estimation
3.	Conducting PFR runs
4.	Analysis of PFR Run Data
  
Tasks required for each activity are detailed in Figure 1, AN/TPY-2 PFR Process (attached), and need to be performed for each sensor of interest represented in the PFR.


1. Pre-PFR Analysis:

Pre-PFR analysis involves thorough evaluation of the PFR inputs, including trajectories and RCS models.  All trajectories supplied for use in a PFR event must be assessed in terms of how accurately they represent the target scenario presented to the sensor(s) on day of flight (DOF).  Trajectories need to be assessed against several requirements:

- Trajectories must represent physically realizable target motion (no large instantaneous jumps).

- Deployed objects must first appear at a reasonable distance from the parent object.

- Component differences must be consistent.  For example,  point-to-point position differences must be consistent with velocity components and likewise point-to-point velocity differences must be consistent with accelerations.

- Event timing reflected in trajectories must be consistent with DOF at times determined by key sensor measurements.

RCS models must be assessed to determine if they adequately represent the target(s) as presented to the sensor(s) on mission day.  Criteria used will be highly dependent on the sensor functionality exercised on DOF and thus will be provided for each PFR scenario to be assessed.  At a minimum, model RCS must be evaluated against flight test RCS as a function of time and as a function of viewing angle.  Narrow band signatures must be evaluated.  If a sensor collected wideband data during the live collect then wideband signatures must be evaluated as well.  Several types of RCS models can be provided for a given PFR scenario including N-Point, Augmented Point Scatterer Model (APSM), and statistical.  Execution of this task requires the capability to assess each possible model type. 

In addition to the tasks outlined above, this activity requires participation in any pre-event meetings, telecons, working groups, and Technical Interchange Meetings (TIM) that are held in preparation for a PFR event.

2. Residual Metric and Signature Bias Estimation:

- Metric Bias:
Residual sensor bias present on mission day can affect mission day performance and therefore must be accounted for in the reconstruction of a mission.  Metric bias can be estimated using data from available pre- and post-flight collections on satellites for which High Accuracy Ephemeris (HAE) is available.  A sufficient number of passes to cover the portion of the array face involved in the missions is needed.  If this is obtained, the HAE data can be used to estimate U and V bias as a function of UV position on the array face.  These bias estimates are then used for the PFR.

- Signature Bias:
There are fewer signature calibration satellites than HAE satellites and so fewer passes are expected to be available for estimation of residual signature bias.  Collections on these satellites are used to estimate the SNR offset between the live collections and runs that replicate these collections.  RCS input into the runs is modified until a good SNR match is obtained.  The RCS adjustment that yields a good SNR match to the live collect is selected for use in the PFR runs.

In addition to the tasks outlined above, this activity requires participation in any pre-event meetings, telecons, working groups, and TIMs that are held in preparation for a PFR event.

3. Conduct Runs

Once PFR inputs have been evaluated and bias estimates obtained, the runs can be conducted.  Conducting the runs is a multistep process as outlined below.
- Set up run area
- Verify settings match mission-day (SAPs, environment, radar location, antenna orientation, etc)
- Conduct a run
- Perform Quick Look (QL) analysis on the run data to check for consistency with mission day
- Make adjustments as needed, conduct another run and perform QL analysis
- Repeat this last step until the setup has been verified
- Document settings, inputs used, etc.
- Perform PFR runs
- Distribute data
Note that runs include integration runs, dry runs, runs for record, and if defined, excursion runs.

4. Analysis

Analysis must be performed on data collected during PFR runs, including Integration Runs, Dry Runs and Runs for Record, to assess performance of the sensor models.  This analysis includes Quick Look Analysis for reporting at the Executive Quick Look Briefing (EQLB) typically held 1-2 weeks after completion of the PFR runs, assessment of the run data against the OTA timing criteria and the OTA and SN track accuracy criteria, in-depth investigation of any anomalies identified, and root-cause analysis of any instances of failure of criteria.

Results of PFR run-data analysis are reported at the Mission Data Review (MDR) and Executive Mission Data Review (EMDR), held 1-2 months after completion of the PFR runs.  A briefing for the MDR, including annotated viewgraphs that document the analysis and findings is to be produced.  In addition to participation in the EQLB, MDR, and EMDR, participation in post-test meetings, telecons, working groups, and TIMs is required.

Note that analysis could encompass analysis of the data recorded on the preliminary runs that are conducted during the PFR set up.  This will require close interaction and cooperation with the organization conducting the runs.

 The Government intends to purchase support for the FY2011 through FY2015 timeframe.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) is defining its acquisition strategy for the solicitation and award of an Instructional Systems Development (ISD) requirement to support the Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) course.  Of the available options, NAWCTSD is considering the viability of the following socio-economic approaches:  Total Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) set-aside, Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, and Section 8(a) suitability.

The Contracting Officer must establish a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from two or more HUBZone or SDVOSB entities that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.  As the anticipated value of this procurement does not exceed the competitive 8(a) threshold at FAR 19.805-1(a)(2), the Contracting Officer is considering the Section 8(a) option from a non-competitive perspective.  It is requested that your company review the attached DRAFT SOW and provide a response using the attached DSCA Questionnaire.  The questionnaire has been designed to specifically address key points pertinent to the DSCA course requirement, which will indicate the likelihood that any offers received for this requirement would meet the competitive nature desired for a HUBZone or SDVOSB set-aside or applicability to a Section 8(a) award.

You are advised that the Government is seeking to define the applicability of the requirement with regard to the available socio-economic programs.  The Government is additionally seeking to establish the feasibility of a TSC II LOT II small business set-aside.  From the responses to this market research, the Government will evaluate the options and select the final acquisition strategy.  Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your companys business interests.

The Government is contemplating awarding to other than a large business for this effort, with the resulting contract to be accomplished under the provisions of a Firm Fixed Priced contract. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 541330 with a size standard of $27M. 

If your company is interested in competing for this requirement, please provide a response using the attached DSCA questionnaire.  For purposes of efficiency, it is requested that you utilize the format provided and that no additional information be provided as the content of the questionnaire will adequately satisfy the Contracting Officers objective.  Please address each question as succinctly as possible and return the completed questionnaire to the undersigned via email To: eric.pfefferkorn@navy.mil Cc:  tisa.clark@navy.mil; gregory.dougherty@navy.mil. Alternative submittal methods are via fax to (407) 381-8992, Attn: Code 25333 (Eric Pfefferkorn) or by mail to: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Attn: Code 25333 (Eric Pfefferkorn), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275.  Submittals are due no later than 1600 EST, 26 April 2010.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALThe Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking potential sources to provide an on-boarding new employee web based portal for the VA Health Administration Center.  PURPOSE.  The VA Health Administration Center's (HAC) Office of Human Resources (HR) desires a solution that automates and workflows the process of hiring/onboarding a new or inter-HAC transfer employee through a web-based portal.  BACKGROUND.  HR's New Employee onboarding is a manual, time consuming and costly process to the agency.  This process involves dozens of steps, forms and systems that can result in a loss of productivity, incomplete paperwork, missing compliance related documents, ineffective provisioning and a feeling of disconnect - often resulting in new-hire turnover.  Improving this process will save the agency resources and engage the new employee via a robust, personalized onboarding experience.  HR seeks to better manage a new employee's transition from pre-hire to start date to off boarding by giving employees access to a personalized employee portal containing corporate culture information, task management, electronic forms and workflow, etc.OBJECTIVES.  The HAC onboarding process is a critical part of the organization's human capital management strategy.  Onboarding is a strategic process designed to attract new employees, reaffirm their employment decision, acclimate them into the HAC's culture, and prepare them to contribute to a desired level as quickly as possible.  SCOPE.  The Contractor shall provide information on an onboarding solution that provides for the following primary components:  1) forms management; 2) tasks management; and 3) cultural and social assimilation.  The solution must have a form management and workflow function on the backside of the process where HR may upload specific e-forms and assign tasks to new employees and other process owners, such as IT, logistics, and the employee's supervisor.  The task management should have an automatic email notification for overdue tasks and new tasks as well as task completion metrics.  The solution must have a Web-based portal that may be easily updated and personalized by the agency.  The portal must facilitate the onboarding key processes in sequential order, dependent upon the employee's stage in the hiring process.  The portal also must be a socialization site in which the agency can scale and add to dependent upon the position and work unit in the agency that the employee is hired.  Finally, the solution must meet the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems.  The solution must also comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C.  794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220), August 7, 1998.The NAICS code for this procurement is 511210. This is a sources sought notice only. No formal solicitation document exists at this time. Responses to this notice should include the following: name and address of company/provider, business size (large or small); identify whether or not firm falls into any of the following socioeconomic categories - Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business; Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), HUB Zone, or a Federal Supply Schedule firm.. Packages should contain full corporate information, point of contact, phone/fax/email details, capabilities statement and a brief narrative describing experience providing similar services to the VA, other government agencies or private concerns. Interested parties that can meet these requirements should email, or fax an information package no later than April 30, 2010, to the attention of: Jan Bertapelle-Anderson.  Fax number is 720/889-2387.  Email to Janice.Bertapelle-Anderson@va.gov   No phone calls please.  Please note the fax machine is an office fax - please make sure you include a cover sheet with Jan's name to make sure it reaches the right person.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE 68504.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The Discovery, Early Detection, and Evaluation of Treatment & Prevention in Cancer Research Program at Penn State require a near-infrared imaging system that uses laser-based excitation and near-infrared detection for greater tissue penetration. This system will be used for cell target detection, data gathering and improved research workflow. The near-infrared imaging system requested has the following salient characteristics:<BR>" CCD Detector<BR>" Thermoelectrically Cooled<BR>" Under One Minute Scan Time<BR>" 700nm Channel Excitation 685nm, Emission 720nm<BR>" 800nm Channel Excitation 785nm, Emission 820nm<BR>" Dyes: IRDye 680, IRDye 700DX, IRDye 800RS, IRDye 800CW, Alexa Fluor 680,<BR>Alexa Fluor 750, Cy5.5, Cy7<BR>" Resolution: 85, 170 or 255 Micron<BR>" Image Display Options: Pseudo color, grayscale, single color (red, green or blue), or two<BR>colors with overlapping fluorescence displayed in a third color.<BR>" Single Animal Capacity<BR>" Imaging bed dimensions 16.8 cm W x 12 cm D (6.6 W x 4.75 D). Vertical clearance to<BR>top of drawer is 3.8 cm (1.5).<BR>" Imaging Bed Temperature Range 32-42 0c.<BR>" Gas Anesthesia Ports <BR>" Overall Dimensions 41 W x 41 D x 66 cm H (16 W x 16 D x 26 H)<BR>" Acquisition Speed 500 ms - 40s<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>The Li-Cor Pearl Impulse system is a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system. It is capable of penetrating tissue at a near-infrared range which has numerous applications in bio-imaging including translational research. The amount of tissue penetration offered by the Pearl Impulse system exceeds those of similar near-infrared fluorescence imaging systems. This provides powerful means to detect deeper signals with either fluorescence protein or dye inside animal bodies which cannot be met by other vendor's near-infrared fluorescence imaging systems.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR>A search was conducted between 29 March and 8 April 2010 using Internet search engines, the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) database, and the Small Business Administration (SBA)<BR>Dynamic Small Business Search. The CCR and SBA search referenced NAICS code 334516 in vivo imaging, medical imaging, near-infrared, and ccd detector.<BR>The SBA Dynamic Small Business Search returned few small businesses associated with both<BR>the NAICS 334516 and any of the relevant keywords.<BR>Internet research found that the model that best meet the salient characteristics of the in vivo near-infrared imaging system is available from a single vendor. There are in vivo near-infrared imaging systems available from different manufacturers available on the market. Each manufacturers system has its own set of salient characteristics that are similar to those required by the principal investigators. The other models do not meet resolution requirements of principal<BR>investigators.<BR><BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>None<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>Li-COR is the only manufacturer of in vivo near-infrared imaging system that meets the salient<BR>characteristics of the required item. Other manufacturers are currently improving standards and<BR>adding features to their products that drive market competition. There does not appear to be any<BR>actions that this agency can take to remove or overcome barriers to competition.<BR><BR>6.

<DESC>COB Questions and Answers  Draft RFP<BR><BR>NOTE:  All para references are applicable to the Performance Work Statement (PWS)<BR><BR>Q1. Are joint bids, for example from 2 or 3 partner companies, acceptable? <BR>A1. Yes, a joint bid from 2 partner companies is acceptable.  Contract management must be in country.  <BR><BR>Q2. Is it necessary for bidders to be German registered companies, or can other EU registered (i.e. UK) companies tender?<BR>A2.  Any company, not just EU, may bid on the requirement.  However, all companies are subject to the laws of Germany to include, but not limited to, immigration, tax, Technical Expert Status Accreditation (TESA), Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) and Visa.  The government does not assume this responsibility.<BR><BR>Q3. Is it possible to bid for just some of the supplies required, or are we required to bid for the whole contract? <BR>A3. You are required to bid the whole contract.  <BR><BR>Q4. The tender indicates the level of English fluency required from role-players and interpreters. What level of German fluency is required?  <BR>A4.  Reference Attachment J-2, Language Proficiency Level Definition.  Language proficiency levels apply to all languages, German, English, Modern-Standard Arabic, and Pashto-Dari.  <BR><BR>Q5. Subject to the language requirements do the role-players have to be from specific nationalities?<BR>A5.  No, a specific nationality or origin is not required.  <BR><BR>Q6. Could you clarify what you mean by subcontractors in section 2.1? Are we required to directly employ role-players or can we work with them as self-employed employees?   <BR>A6.  Sub-contractors are defined at FAR 44.101.  All role players must be directly employed by the contractor.  Self-employed  employees or independent contractors may not be used as those are subcontractors.  <BR><BR>Q7. Would it be acceptable for role-players to hold other EU driving licenses instead of German driving licenses? <BR>A7. Yes, a valid EU or international license may be used.  Licenses from the US are not valid.  <BR><BR>Q8. Do we need to submit Resumes for any of the nominated employees?<BR>A8. Resumes are required only for managers and supervisors.  See Evaluation Sub-Factor 4 in Section L of the RFP. <BR><BR>Q9. Is there a minimum annual financial turnover or sales figure you require Offerors to demonstrate?  For example, will you only accept Offerors with annual sales in excess of, say US$5 million?<BR>A9. No.  There is no requirement for offerors to demonstrate a minimum annual financial turnover or sales figure.   <BR><BR>Q10. How many Offerors are so far/will be involved?  <BR>A10. This is a competitive requirement.  <BR><BR>Q11.  In Proposal Instructions - Tab 1 you stated: The Offeror shall provide a database of 3000 individuals inclusive of 1,000 generic type role players and 1,000 cultural type role players who speak Modern Standard Arabic and/or Pashtu-Dari.  How should the database be provided within the Technical Proposal (as the Technical Proposal is limited to 50 pages)? <BR>A11. This requirement has been deleted from Section L, Proposal Instructions, Tab 1.  It will be required after contract award.  See PWS, revised paragraph 5.1.  <BR><BR>Q12.  Which personnel data should be included in the database (name, address, dob...)?      <BR>A12.  See Question 11<BR>		<BR>Q13.  Is it mandatory that all Arabic / Pashtu or Dari speaking Role Players speak the German language as well?  There would be a significant reduction of the price if the German language would NOT be mandatory.<BR>A13.  Yes, it is mandatory.  The language of the Training Center is German for safety reasons.  <BR>	<BR>Q14.  Does the US army manage the fingerprint system with the help of the contractor or does the US army wish the contractor to manage this system alone? <BR>A14.  The Contractor is responsible for managing their own fingerprint system; however, the Government reserves the right to access the system as needed.  <BR><BR>Q15.  If the contractor has to manage the fingerprint system what is the deadline for the US Army to receive the fingerprint information from the date it was taken? Is there a special technical system required for taking the information and storing it....also is there any additional information to be added the fingerprint? <BR>A15.  Fingerprint information must be received prior to execution of the task order.  See revised para 5.2.1.  There is no special technical system or additional information required.  <BR><BR>Q16.  Is it required that the fingerprint is taken at the beginning of every exercise or is it enough that the fingerprint is taken only once? <BR>A16.  In accordance with revised para 5.2.1, contractors are responsible for having standard 10-print fingerprint cards for all of their role players, supervisors and administrative personnel.  Fingerprints only need to be taken and turned in once.  The Government requires the fingerprints of all contractor personnel who have been cleared for access to the installation.      <BR><BR>Q17.  Does the JMRC provide the possibility of accommodation and food for a CoB Reservepool? If yes what is within this facility and what such food is provided, i.e. Size of rooms, number of people per room, is breakfast and dinner provided but not lunch or is it just breakfast, are the shower facilities communal, are there specific religious prayer rooms also, is the accommodation free or at the contractors cost if the accommodation is provided?  <BR>A17.  Para 4.2.7 addresses Replacement Role Players.  Also see para 4.2.6 concerning billeting.  The government will house, on post, in open bay billets.  Para 4.2.4 addresses government furnished meals.  Lastly, there are no specific religious prayer rooms available.    <BR><BR>Q18.  What is the method of payment to the contractor for the standby reservepool? <BR>A18.  There is no monetary payment for reserve pools.  <BR><BR>Q19.  Are the reservepool hours in addition to the hours already outlined in the tender?  <BR>A19.  No.  The reserve pool is a contractor responsibility to ensure guaranteed services.  <BR><BR>Q20.  Is the contractor only allowed to use exiled Afghans or people with afghan roots or is it allowed that the contractor uses foreign nationals of Afghanistan with common knowledge of Afghanistan? (By common knowledge we mean speakers of Pashtu or Dari) <BR>A20.  No specific origin or nationality is required.  <BR><BR>Q21.  Is the contractor subject to a fixed amount of hours to work per day?  If the contractor completes the set tasks for that day in less hours than is in the contract does the contractor get paid for the full amount of hours or just the hours worked? <BR>A21.  The RFP has been restructured whereby the minimum number of hours per role player, per day is 10.  All hours over the normal 10 hour work day will be paid in accordance with the applicable RFP line items for overtime and weekends.  <BR><BR>Q22.  Are the COBs fully insured for all vehicular activity within base or outside of base?  <BR>A22.  Contractors are responsible for insuring their own employees.    <BR><BR>Q23.  Does the US Army give familiarisation lessons into vehicles and surroundings to the COBS or is this on the contractor?  <BR>A23.  Yes, the US Army will be responsible for providing familiarization lessons to all drivers on the vehicles and their surroundings. <BR><BR>Q24.  Are all vehicles insured by the US army for accidents, damage or fatality? Or is this a requirement from the Contractor? <BR>A24.  The Government is self-insured, therefore, the vehicles to be furnished and used are covered by the Government.  However, should it be determined that the accident or damage was caused due to negligence by the contractors employee, the Government will seek remedy.  As referenced in Question 22, contractors are responsible for insuring their own employees.  The Federal Tort Claims Act only protects federal employees from liability arising out of their negligent or wrongful acts, as long as such acts were performed while acting within the scope of employment.  Contractors are not considered Government employees and therefore must have their own insurance.    <BR><BR>Q25.  Do the COBS have to be security cleared prior to contract starting?   Is the allocated time between the contract being signed and the contract starting enough for the US Army to carry out the security checks on the COBS. <BR>A25.  No.  The Government will start security checking COBs on the first day of the contract (task order).  Yes, the time between contract signature and contract start date is sufficient for the US Government to perform security checks.   <BR><BR>Q26.  Is a phase for implementation planned? If so in which period? <BR>A26.  No, there is no phased implementation planned.                                                                                      <BR><BR>Q27.  Is it possible to use COBs from the USA or the UK?  <BR>A27.  Yes.  See Question 2.    <BR>	<BR>Q28.  CLIN DELIVERY/TASK ORDER MINIMUM/ MAXIMUM QUANTITY AND CLIN ORDER VALUE.  What are this tables used for?  <BR>A28.  Nothing.  Tables have been deleted from RFP.<BR><BR>Q29.   5.1.1 PWS.  The Contractors employees must submit to screening by the German Intel agency.

The word demonstrated has been deleted.  <BR><BR>With regards to the security checks:<BR><BR>Q32.  Will the fingerprints be taken by the government with the support of the contractor?<BR>A32.   No, the contractor is responsible for taking their employees fingerprints. <BR><BR>Q33.  If so what is the contractor required to perform? <BR>A33.  See revised para 5.2.1. <BR><BR>Q34.  If the contractor has to take the fingerprints, until when are the prints to be submitted to the government?<BR>A34.  Fingerprints must be submitted prior to the start of the task order the employee works. <BR><BR>Q35.  Which are the technical requirements for taking fingerprints and storing this data?  <BR>A35.  See revised para 5.2.1.  The Government has no technical requirements for taking fingerprints or storing the data.    <BR><BR>Q36.  Do all Cobs have their fingerprints to be taken at each rotation, or is a onetime submission sufficient?<BR>A36.  See Question 16  <BR><BR>Q37.  With regard to the COB reserve pool personnel, is the contractor expected to pay the full cost of both housing and meals?  Will the government pay for any amount of housing and meals, if so how much and under which circumstances.  In the Estimated Quantity of hours, are there hours included for the reserve pool? <BR>A37.  See Question 17.  There are no hours included for the reserve pool.  <BR><BR>Q38.  Please specify the format of the database which you want submitted as performance capability. When it will be required to be submitted (with the offer?/after the award?) and what level of detail should be included in the database (e.g. COB Name, address, phone contact, nationality, etc.).  <BR>A38.  See Question 11    <BR><BR>Q39.  In regards to generic cultural role players, do contractor COBs have to have a nationality in which the required languages are spoken?  Or can COBs have a different nationality?<BR>A39.  No specific origin or nationality is required. <BR> <BR>Q40.  Will there be a guarantee of a minimum number of working hours per day for each (per Task Order required) COB?  <BR>A40.  Yes, see Question 21 <BR><BR>Q41.  Will there be a guarantee of a maximum number of working hours per day for each (per Task Order required) COB? <BR>A41.  No.  All hours over the normal 10 hours will be paid in accordance with the applicable contract line items for overtime and weekends.  <BR><BR>Q42.  The draft RFP requires that the contractors COB drives US government vehicles, are the vehicles insured by the US Government, or should they be by the contractor. Is the driver insured by the US Government or should the driver be insured by the contractor.<BR>A42.  See Question 24   <BR><BR>Q43.  Will the contractors COBs instructed by the government on how to drive the vehicles and also on the driving environments in JMTC. <BR>A43.  Yes, the US Army will be responsible for providing familiarization lessons to all drivers on the vehicles and their surroundings.<BR><BR>Q44.  In regards to the government security checks, when does the contractor have to submit the database for the government security check the first time?<BR>A44.  In accordance with revised para 5.1, a fully populated database must be submitted 7 days after contract award.  <BR><BR>Q45.  How long does the government anticipate the security check will take? <BR>A45.  See revised para 5.0, Processing of Role Players.  Excluding the initial background check, the government security check generally takes one (1) day.    <BR><BR>Q46.  Is the contractor only able to submit new COBs for the government security checks only every 180 days as specified in the RFP, or can the contractor submit new COBs for the government security check anytime?  <BR>A46.  New COBs may only be submitted every 180 days, however, the Government  reserves the right to review new COBs on a case by case basis.  <BR><BR>Q47.  Is there going to be a Phase In for the new contractor?  If there is how long is it going to be?  And will the incumbent support the new contractor?  <BR>A47.  See Question 26.  The incumbent is not required support a new contractor.  <BR><BR>Q48.  Will there be a question and answer round after the final solicitation is issued?    <BR>A48.  Only as required.<BR><BR>Q49.  The Draft RFP states, In no event shall the Contractor have subcontractors working as Role Players on this contract.   Would the Government consider Joint Ventures (JVs) as an allowable approach to providing the required Role Player services?  <BR>A49.  Yes, JVs are an allowable approach (See Question 1).  <BR><BR>Q50.  The Draft RFP states, The Offeror shall provide a database of 3000 individuals inclusive of 1,000 generic type role players and 1,000 cultural type role players who speak Modern Standard Arabic and/or Pashtu-Dari.  Must a proposal include this data or could the bidding company demonstrate how it would fully populate its database prior to start of work?  It would considerably limit competition if a bidder must have a German based database of that magnitude to provide a compliant proposal.  <BR>A50.  See Question 11       <BR><BR>Q51.  The Draft RFP states, Total page count, excluding tabs shall not exceed 50 pages.  Is the page count for all four volumes or just Volume1?   <BR>A51.  50 page count limit is per volume, not just Volume 1.  <BR><BR>Q52.  The Draft RFP states, The contractor shall use Standard Form 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, for all reimbursable hours billed against this contract.  Is billing to be in Euro or USD?   <BR>A52.   US based companies must be in US dollars; all others must be in the local currency, euros.  At time of proposal evaluation, for price comparison purpose, euros will be converted to US dollars using the US Govt annual fiscal year conversion rate.   <BR><BR>Q53.  Would German Technical Expert Status (TES) be offered to the PM / A, PM under the provisions of a contract award? <BR>A53.  See Question 2<BR><BR>Q54.  Reference the following terms of the solicitation, which states:<BR><BR>2.1.1  Definition of Role Players<BR>Generic  speaks German, English language proficiency, Lvl I<BR>Interpreter/Special Skill  speaks German, English language proficiency, Lvl  II<BR>Generic Cultural  speaks German, Modern Standard Arabic, English language proficiency, Lvl I<BR>Cultural Interpreter/Special Skill  speaks German, Modern Standard Arabic, English language proficiency, Lvl II<BR>Generic Cultural  speaks German, Pashto/Dari, English language proficiency, Lvl I <BR>Cultural Interpreter/Special Skill  speaks German, Pashto/Dari, English language proficiency, Lvl II<BR>Tab 1  Recruiting & Casting Plan (Evaluation Sub-Factor 1), The offeror shall demonstrate its understanding of the overall Performance work statement as set forth in paragraphs 1.0 through 8.0.  The Offeror shall provide a database of 3000 individuals inclusive of 1,000 generic type role players and 1,000 cultural type role players who speak Modern Standard Arabic and/or Pashtu-Dari. &  The evaluation criterion for Sub-Factor 1 indicates that the data base must contain 1,000 cultural type role players with either Arabic or Pashtu-Dari speaking ability.  Does the mean that the database need not have a mandatory minimum number of Pashtu-Dari speakers? <BR><BR>A54.   See revised para 5.1.  Submitted database must include 1,000 generic type role players, 1,000 cultural type role players who speak Modern Standard Arabic, and 1,000 cultural type role players who speak Pashto or Dari.  <BR><BR>Q55.  Is there a requirement that proposed COBs listed in the data base provide their consent to the listing?  In other words, can any names be listed in the data base, regardless of whether the individual knows about it? <BR>A55.  See Question 11.  The requirement for submission of database before contract award has been deleted.  <BR><BR>Q56.  We have the following question regarding Exhibit A (Price Proposal) of the solicitation:  Under past solicitations for the COB project the unit prices for e.g.ELIN A001AA were for days (normal work day up to 10 hours).  In the present solicitation the unit prices for these ELINS were changed to hours.  How are these work hours defined?  <BR>A56.  For the current solicitation, ELINs were deleted.  The requirement for COB services was re-established as CLINs (contract line items).  The normal workday has been revised to 10 hours.  See Question 21.    <BR><BR>Q57.  The COB Personnel are not allowed to leave the training village nor the training area (PWS 1.4).  What is the minimum of work hours per person and per day?  Example:  If the proposal is by hours, a purchase order with 1000 hours could ask for 500 COBs that are used only 2 hours a day.  Or the other way round, the contractor can send only 42 COBs to fulfill the 1000 hours order.  This has a great influence on the proposal pricing.  We would appreciate to get a clarification, how many workdays are included in the ELINs A001AA, A001AB, A001AG, A001AH and for the other workday related ELINs, or how a workday is defined. <BR>A57.  ELINs do not apply to this solicitation.  Additionally, see Question 21.  <BR><BR>Q58.  Para 3.1 states In no event shall Contractors have subcontractors working as COB Role Players on this contract.  Does this mean the contractors Role Players must all be employees/part time employees of the Prime and cannot be provided from potential Team Members on the effort? <BR>A58.  All role players must work for the Prime contractor.  If the successful offeror is a joint venture company, role players must work for one of the joint venture companies.<BR><BR>Q59.  Reference Para 1.12.6.1. Initial Processing of COBs Point 1. (Page 7)  It is upon the Governments discretion to determine the location of the security check prior to each rotation.  Does this mean that the Government decides whether the GSC is performed on post or off post?  Or does it mean the Government determines the place of the location also when the GSC is off post? <BR>A59.  Yes, the Government determines whether the GSC is performed on or off post.  If off post, the Government does not determine the place of  location.  See para 3.4.  <BR><BR>Q60.  Is the contractor responsible for the buses/drivers that will bring the role players on to the base to the designated location, or is the contractor only responsible for transportation up to the entrance gate? <BR>A60.  The contractor is responsible for ensuring their employees get to the initial designated location on post.  Once all security checks have been completed, the Government is responsible for transporting role players to their designated location.  See para 3.2.   <BR><BR>Q61.  Reference  Page 13 of 55, paragraph 3.6, which states Contract employees shall not be granted passes to leave to visit businesses or restaurants outside of HTA.  Are Contract employees authorized to visit businesses or restaurants inside of HTA? <BR>A61.  For security reasons, contract employees are not granted passes to visit businesses or restaurants outside or inside of HTA.   <BR><BR>Q62.  Reference  Page 14 of 55, paragraph 5.3, which states The Government shall provide transportation for COB Role Players within the HTA and all transportation related to their assignment.  Are Contractor CM, ACM, or Supervisors authorized to operate Contractor/Privately Owned Vehicles to training sites? <BR>A62.  Yes<BR><BR>Q63.  We feel that the following problem may arise in non-active periods were not included in the above time volumes:  The actors stay on the ground of JMRC for 24 hours and are bound to taking orders, whereas deployment of less than 24 hours is provided by exhibits A through C.  How will such unaccounted time be accounted by the government?  <BR>A63.  This will be a labor hour contract.  ALL costs must be included in the labor hour rates proposed.  <BR><BR>Q64.  Can you provide information on minimum action hours per day of exercise, as will be paid per employee?  Your wording up to 10 hours may be open to the conclusion that in an extreme case there might be only one hour of action or maybe no action at all on a given day.  This, in our understanding, might rule out any payment for that given day by the client. <BR>A64.  See Question 21  <BR><BR>Q65.  Our pricing department has questions concerning potential Other Direct Costs (ODCs); specifically would bus transportation to and from the exercise area for Role Players be considered a reimbursable ODC?  The RFP states it is the contractors responsibility but might these cost be reimbursable under Task Order as ODCs?  <BR>A65.  See Question 63 <BR><BR>Q66.  The other potential ODC in question is leased vehicles/fuel for the contractors management team in support of the exercise.  Again, would these costs be a reimbursable as ODCs under a TO? <BR>A66.  See Question 63   <BR><BR>Q67.  Does the documentation for temporary employment agency (Arbeitnehmeruberlassung) have to be submitted at time of submitting the offer as dictated by German labor? <BR>A67.  Yes.  Verification of compliance with Arbeitnehmeruberlassung will be conducted when the Contracting Officer evaluates an offerors responsibility.  Award cannot be made to a firm which cannot comply as dictated by German law.    <BR><BR>Q68.  Is there a possibility that the double number of COBs (max. 1600 people) has to be provided if labor hour limits as prescribed by German labor law are exceeded? <BR>A68.   The number of COBs required will be stated on each task order.  Please refer to clause 52.216-19, Order Limitations of the RFP.  The Governments requirement is a standard 10 hour work day.  It is the contractors  responsibility to ensure the requirement and labor laws are met.  All costs must be factored into the labor hour rates proposed.   <BR><BR>Q69.  How long do the required security checks of the different agencies take?<BR>A69.  See Question 45    <BR><BR>Q70.  Will there be payment for replacement COBs on stand-by which are not used during the exercise? <BR>A70.   No.  See Question 18<BR><BR>Q71.  Reference  Page 12 of 55, paragraph 3.3, which states Contractor employees shall be required to wear a Kevlar or safety helmet at all times during vehicular movement.  Will Contractor employees (COB Role Players, Supervisors, etc.) ever be required to operate any military vehicles?<BR>A71.  No.  Role players will only be required to operate non-tactical military vehicles.   <BR><BR>Q72.  What compensation will be paid in the event of premature termination or extension of the exercise?  <BR>A72.  In accordance with applicable with FAR clauses, the contractor will be fairly compensated should a task order be terminated prior to or extended beyond the original scheduled date.  <BR><BR>Q73.  Can the COBs move about freely during their free time, to include leaving the site? <BR>A73.  No <BR><BR>Q74.  What insurance documentation must be submitted with the offer, for example insurance indicating that the COBs may fly in the military helicopters? <BR>A74.   No insurance documentation is required to be submitted with offer.  See para 3.1.1<BR><BR>Q75.  How will overtime hours be compensated? <BR>A75.  CLINs have been established for overtime hours which will be paid on an hourly rate.  <BR><BR>Q76.  With reference to submission of the data banks, do these have to contain the level and test results for the listed COB? <BR>A76.  No<BR><BR>Q77.  In the event the level and test results must be included in the data bank, what procedure is used to determine whether this information is actually correct? <BR>A77.  The level and test results are not required to be included in the data bank.  <BR>

<DESC>Description: Food Label and Package Survey (FLAPS)
<p>This is an RFI NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (i.e. certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses) for FLAPS survey (Food Label and Package Survey).</p>
<p>This information is being sought for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation. If in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this will be included on the source list. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. FDA may consider soliciting services for a two year contract.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>FDA has conducted the Food Label and Package Survey (FLAPS) for more than 30 years (biennially from 1976 to 1997, in 2000-2001, and again in 2006-2007). The FLAPS provides current information on the state of product package labeling from a nationally representative sample of processed packaged food products.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FLAPS database enables FDA to: (1) keep abreast of market responses to food labeling rules via changes in food package labels (e.g., trans fat labeling); (2) provide a sampling frame for studies that compare analytical nutrient values with the label values; (3) examine the types of ingredients that manufacturers are using; (4) review the serving size declarations on packaged foods; (5) determine the nutrient content claims and health claims that are being used on labels and the types of products that qualify for the claims; and (6) determine prevalence of food safety (e.g., refrigeration and pasteurization labeling) and other consumer information on food products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Draft Objectives:</p>
<p>The objectives are to (1) purchase a food and dietary supplement marketing database that contains various information outlined below; (2) purchase food products that FDA selects from the market data and obtain food labels; (3) develop a data entry system to enter food label information (specified by FDA) from the food products and create database by keying the label information to the database; (4) scan the food labels; and (5) sending the entire food packages (not the content of the foods) to FDA.</p>
<p>Draft Scope of Work:</p>
<p><br />Draft Task A:</p>
<p>Task A-1. We anticipate the contractor may provide FDA historical sales scanner data from markets representing total U.S. All retail outlets combined (i.e., food, drug, and mass merchandisers) in electronic, Excel format as detailed below. The data shall be for each of the 52 weeks (i.e., weekly) starting with the week ending September 12, 2009, and for the total for these 52 weeks (i.e., one year total). The data will be available for use by FDA employees and FDA's designated contractors as needed for FDA research projects. The data will be compatible and directly comparable to FDA's existing time series of Nielsen company data in terms of coverage, statistical sampling, and grouping in department and category.</p>
<p>The contractor may provide consistently identified brand descriptions, so that the UPCs can easily be sorted by brand.</p>
<p>The following departments will be provided:</p>
<p>i. (00)DRY GROCERY DEPARTMENT (inclusive of all subcategories)<br />ii. (01)FROZEN FOODS DEPARTMENT (inclusive of all subcategories) <br />iii. (02)DAIRY DEPARTMENT (inclusive of all subcategories) <br />iv. (03) DELI DEPARTMENT (inclusive of all subcategories)<br />v. (05)FRESH PRODUCE DEPARTMENT (inclusive of all subcategories) <br />vi. (07)ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES (inclusive of all subcategories)<br />vii. DIETARY SUPPLEMENT CATEGORY within THE HEALTH AND BEAUTY DEPARTMENT (inclusive of all subcategories)<br />Data will be included at the category, subcategory, product module, brand description, and UPC level. The following characteristics shall be provided for DEPARTMENTS (00), (01), (02), (03), (05), (07), and dietary supplement department where available:</p>
<p>FIRST COLUMN (i.e., product name with size where available)<br />UNVERSAL PROD CODE<br />PRODUCT LEVEL (i.e., CATEGORY, SUBCATEGORY, PRODUCT MODULE, BRAND DESCRIPTION, and UPC)<br />DEPARTMENT<br />CATEGORY<br />SUB-CATEGORY<br />PRODUCT MODULE<br />BRAND DESCRIPTION<br />EQUIVALIZED BASE<br />HIGH BRAND (BE HIGH DESCRIPTION)<br />LOW BRAND (BE LOW DESCRIPTION)<br />CONTAINER <br />PACKAGE GENERAL SHAP <br />PACK TYPE<br />PACKAGE TYPE <br />DOLLAR VOLUME<br />UNIT VOLUME<br />EQUIVALENT UNIT VOLUME <br />%ACV SELLING PRODUCT<br />AVERAGE UNIT PRICE<br />PRODUCT<br />STYLE<br />FLAVOR<br />FORM <br />SIZE<br />TYPE<br />MARKET POSITIONING CHARACTERISTICS (e.g., whole grain, fat free, less sugar, reduced calorie)<br />%ACV by promotion condition:<br />No feature or display<br />Any feature or display<br />Feature without display<br />Display without feature<br />Feature and display</p>
<p>Task A-2. The contractor may also provide FDA with a list of private label UPC numbers matched to the aggregated, masked UPCs in the scanner data detailed in Task A in Excel format. The contractor may provide all of the available characteristics.</p>
<p>Task A-3. The contractor may provide FDA with a list of abbreviations used for Tasks A-1 and A-2 in Excel format.</p>
<p><br />Draft Task B:</p>
<p>Provide approximately 3,000 food products that FDA selects based upon the market data that FDA will obtain in Task A. FDA will provide to the Contractor a list of food products (shopping list) with FLAPS ID numbers to purchase in Excel format no later than January 1, 2011. The list of food products will include mostly brand name products with specific UPCs but also include some control/private label products with masked UPCs which represent aggregate private label products. The Contractor may be required to locate products with regional and local, as well as national distribution, and therefore, must have access to a wide range of geographical locations and knowledge of which retail organizations and individual stores carry local or regional items. Also for the control/private label products with masked UPCs, the Contractor may be responsible for identifying the most appropriate private label product for the masked UPCs. For food products that cannot be found at the retail stores, the Contractor may contact the manufacturer to obtain the product packages (that contain food labels). The Contractor may report products that are discontinued or unable to obtain for other reasons to the project officer. The Contractor may empty and clean out the food packages (that contain food labels) and affix a FLAP ID label to each product package, without covering important label information. For quality control, the Contractor may maintain an electronic inventory of the names and numbers of products purchased, as well as those still to be located. Because the Contractor for Task B must have access to the detailed sales data associated with control/private label products. Tasks A and B may be awarded to the same Contractor.</p>
<p>Draft Task C:</p>
<p>The Contractor may develop a data entry system to enter food label information from the food products, create database by keying the label information to the database, carry out quality control of the database, scan the food labels, and send the food labels to FDA. Specifically the following tasks are required:</p>
<p>Task C-1. The Contractor may develop a data entry system to enter food label information that FDA specifies. FDA will provide the Contractor an electronic FLAPS form that lists the detail information to be collected from the food labels. See Appendix A for the draft FLAPS form (this form will be supplied later before RFP is published). The Access data entry system that FDA developed for the 2006-2007 FLAPS will be provided to the Contractor as an example. The Contractor may use other data entry system, but the database that the Contractor provides to FDA must be in the format that is readable by SAS.</p>
<p>Task C-2. The manager and some key-in personnel attend a one-day training session at FDA to learn about the FLAPS form.</p>
<p>Task C-3. Key-in all information from product labels in the database as instructed by FDA. The key-in personnel and a manger/managers must be proficient in English to ensure accurate data entry.</p>
<p>Task C-4. Scan product labels including the FLAPS ID label in PDF format using a flat bed scanner in color at high resolution with a minimum of 1,200 dpi. Small texts in the food labels must be legible in the PDF files. Some product packages are large; therefore, a scanner with large scanning surface is necessary. For the 2006-2007 FLAPS, a scanner with scanning surface of 12.5 inches x 17.5 inches was used to scan the food labels.</p>
<p>Task C-5. Link the PDF files to the database if possible.</p>
<p>Task C-6. Copy the database and the PDF scans onto CDs</p>
<p>Task C-7. Perform quality control of work particularly for completeness and accuracy of label information in the database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Reporting Requirements and Deliverable Items</p>
<p>Draft Task A:</p>
<p>The Contractor may provide a sample report format for the market data. The Contractor may deliver the data specified in Tasks A-1, A-2, and A-3 in Scope of Work that are compatible with FDA software. The delivery may be due at FDA within two weeks of signing the contracts.</p>
<p><br />Draft Task B:</p>
<p>The Contractor may meet with the project officer within one month after the contract is awarded, and provide (in Microsoft Word) a detailed oral and written description of the purchase plans for the foods. The Contractor will discuss with the project officer about how to deal with foods that cannot be obtained at the retail stores or from the manufacturers. FDA will provide to the Contractor a list of food products (shopping list) to purchase in Excel format no later than January 1, 2011. The Contractor may collect the selected food products and empty and clean out the packages. The Contractor may affix the FDA ID label to each food package, without covering important label information. This task must be completed by June 30, 2011. The Contractor must provide FDA a monthly report of an electronic inventory of the names and numbers of products purchased, as well as those still to be located and a narrative review of work accomplished and/or significant events regarding the contract.</p>
<p><br />Draft Task C:</p>
<p>The Contractor may meet with the project officer within one month after the contract is awarded, and provide (in Microsoft Word) a detailed oral and written description of database development plan and the coding and scanning plans, and quality control plans. The Contractor may provide a monthly report or deliverable for informal technical work directives. The report will contain a narrative review of work accomplished and/or significant events regarding the contract; other information regarding milestone or deliverable progress, such as potential/experienced problem areas, resolution of problems, anticipated progress, deliverables or milestones due during the next reporting period; percent of work completed toward interim or final deliverable; and estimates of time to complete the deliverable. In addition, the Contractor must provide monthly a CD containing the food label database (i.e., cumulative data) and the PDF files of scanned food labels (i.e., cumulative files). The Contractor may submit the data entry system created for this project in electronic file, complete food label database in electronic file, and all of the food packages (not the content of the food package) to the FDA project officer by April 1, 2012.</p>

<CONTACT>Jason G. Matheny, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-10-05@ugov.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS <br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Aggregative Contingent Estimation (ACE) Program on 19 May 2010, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on ACE, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities and find potential team partners. This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.  <br /><br />PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS <br />Intelligence analysts are often asked to forecast significant events on the basis of limited quantitative data. It is common for such events to be contingent upon earlier events or actions. Generally, forecasts are prepared using expert judgment by individuals and small groups. Empirical research outside the intelligence community has shown that the accuracy of judgment-based forecasts is consistently improved by mathematically aggregating the judgments of many independent experts. The goal of the ACE Program is to dramatically enhance the accuracy, precision, and timeliness of intelligence forecasts for a broad range of event types, through the development of advanced techniques that elicit, weight, and combine the judgments of many intelligence analysts.   <br /><br />The ACE Program seeks technical innovations in the following areas: (a) efficient elicitation of probabilistic judgments, including conditional probabilities for contingent events; (b) mathematical aggregation of judgments by many individuals, based on factors that may include: past performance, expertise, cognitive style, metaknowledge, and other attributes predictive of accuracy; and (c) effective representation of aggregated probabilistic forecasts and their distributions. The ACE Program will build upon technical achievements of past research and on state-of-the-art systems used today for generating probabilistic forecasts from widely-dispersed experts. The program will involve empirical testing of forecasting accuracy against real events.  <br /><br />Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers are strongly encouraged.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate is seeking information on the capabilities of the market to provide innovative technologies that may meet Operationally Deployable Explosives Mitigation (ODEM) project goals.
<p>DHS S&amp;T administers programs to develop, test and evaluate, and transition to commercialization next-generation technologies required to effectively counter potential threats to the Nation. DHS S&amp;T achieves this goal through sponsorships and partnerships with the private sector, national laboratories, universities, and other government agencies (both domestic and foreign). The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) focuses on homeland security research and development that could lead to significant technology breakthroughs and greatly enhance departmental operations. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established HSARPA to support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>DHS S&amp;T is committed to protecting the homeland, its infrastructure, and citizens from threats including those presented by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The Operationally Deployable Explosives Mitigation project is being initiated by DHS S&amp;T HSARPA to pursue innovative solutions to defeat or mitigate a home made explosive in the emplacement or detonation phases of the IED event chain. The ODEM project is a FY2011 new start with a planned budget on the order of $25 million over five years. DHS S&amp;T HSARPA anticipates making multiple awards to pursue and evaluate the most promising solutions proposed.</p>
<p>The ODEM project is seeking GAME-CHANGING technologies that offer break-through potential and that may be disruptive to the traditional manner in which technology development occurs. Accordingly, DHS S&amp;T HSARPA is willing to accept moderate to high technology development risk if a research effort promises a high payoff.</p>

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source modification under Contract No. HHSS283200800004C.

Contractor: RTI International, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2194.

The purpose of this contract modification is to expand the 2011 Mental Health Surveillance Survey (MHSS) that will be conducted as part of the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). This activity will be funded using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds through Intra-Departmental Delegation Authority, or IDDA. 

Currently, in the 2009-2011 NSDUHs, a MHSS sample of 500 respondents is being completed each year on a sub-sample of the NSDUH respondents using the K-6 and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) impairment scale. The 2012 and 2013 surveys will continue with a MHSS sample of 500 respondents in order to calibrate the NSDUH mental health screening scales, if necessary. Interviews will be completed over the telephone by mental health clinicians. 

Through the use of ARRA funds, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to fund activities that will: expand the MHSS by an additional 1,000 structured clinical interviews, or SCID interviews, in the 2011 survey year, bringing the total number to 1,500 SCID interviews in 2011; conduct a study aimed at assessing the feasibility of adding an adult and youth longitudinal follow-up study to the NSDUH; produce analytic and methodological reports on a variety of topics using existing data from NSDUH and other data systems as appropriate; and assess the feasibility of producing a data enclave for the MHSS data. 

NIMH has an interest in this expansion due to a desire to increase the NIMH research portfolio in population-based mental health studies that build on established federal surveillance survey platforms. NIMH plans to use results from this expansion to analyze and report on major mental health conditions (e.g., Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Manic Episode, Anorexia Nervosa) based on data collected from a nationally representative sample. NIMH is also interested in assessing the feasibility of developing a longitudinal component (i.e., the same respondents interviewed on different occasions) and in the production of an additional number of analytic and methodological reports to address their mission. 
 
Demonstration of Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications:

Under the 2010-2011 NSDUH contract, the current contractor, RTI International, performs 500 SCID interviews each survey year as part of the MHSS. RTI International is the only contractor that has the necessary familiarity with the design and implementation of the 2011 mental health surveillance study to insure that the additional 1,000 SCID interviews in 2011 will result in the collection of comparable data through 2011. Current contract activities include: (1) maintaining a pool of experienced interviewers and interviewer supervisory staff to screen approximately 182,500 dwelling units and conduct 67,500 completed interviews each survey year, using computer-assisted interviewing technology; (2) developing training procedures/materials and conduct training classes in order to maintain a qualified field staff and satisfy survey fieldwork goals; (3) employing small area estimation techniques (Hierarchical Bayes estimation) to produce model-based estimates at the State and local area level; (4) performing technical writing, analysis, and methodological studies associated with the redesign; and (5) conducting the MHSS to provide accurate estimates of the prevalence of serious mental illness (SMI) and other disorders among adults (aged 18 or older) at the national and state level. RTI International is the only available source that possesses the requisite capabilities and resources to commence work on this ARRA requirement in the short time frame needed.

Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

At this time, RTI International is the only contractor that will be able to provide the required services. This task requires a contractor with expert knowledge in the collection of data from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), along with methods and analysis as they apply to the NSDUH; and the ability to recruit, hire, and train a substantial number of clinical interviewer personnel in the short time frame required. The current NSDUH contract has another three (3) years of performance activities remaining. This modification provides for additional work requested by NIMH for expansion of the MHSS activities planned for the 2011 NSDUH.  Award to another contractor for this work would be time and cost prohibitive and represent a duplication of effort. 

This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1))Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capabilities received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Simulation facilities (SimLabs) Participants toresult in a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for a total of 5 years (base period ofone-year with four one-year options).  The Government estimates, but does not guarantee,that the volume of purchases through this agreement will be approximately $980,000.00 peryear or a total of $4,900,000 for the full five years.	This BPA will not obligate anyfunds.	This BPA will include two Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs for the base year andeach option year): a Firm Fixed CLIN for the Simulation Participants and a Time andMaterials CLIN for Travel.This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are beingrequested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Offerors are required to usethe On-Line RFQ system to submit their quote.  The On-line RFQ system is linked above orit may be accessed at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=21#140796   . The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.BACKGROUND: NASA Ames Research Centers Simulation facilities, jointly called SimLabs, support awide range of research with emphasis on aerospace vehicles, aerospace systems andoperations, aviation human factors and air transportation system safety and capacity. For more information please see: www.simlabs.arc.nasa.gov. SimLabs consists of flight simulators and air traffic control simulators as describedbelow: The flight simulators include the Crew Vehicle Systems Research Facility (CVSRF) B747-400Simulator; the CVSRF Advanced Concepts Flight Simulator; and the Vertical MotionSimulator (VMS).  The air traffic control simulators include the FutureFlight Central(FFC) and the Crew Vehicle Systems Research Facility (CVSRF) Air Traffic Control (ATC)Lab. The CVSRF consists of two full motion flight simulators and an ATC Laboratory.	The threecan be operated individually or integrated.  The purpose of the CVSRF is to study safetyand technical innovations individually, or as they affect the pilot/controller workingrelationship.  Typical CVSRF flight simulation experiments involve scenarios designed tolook at specific questions regarding pilot/flight deck interface or pilot/controllerinterface.  There may be several runs per day or one real-time flight profile.	Thetypical study will last one to two weeks.  Typical CVSRF pilot and controller needs vary. Flight crews have normally been one crew (2 pilots) per day; however there have beenstudies that have required up to 5 crews per day for up to a week.  ATC controller andpseudo-pilot requirements vary from zero to eight. The VMS is a high fidelity motion-base flight simulator capable of simulating a widerange of aerospace vehicle. FFC is a full-scale air traffic control tower simulator dedicated to solving the presentand emerging air traffic capacity and safety problem of the nations airports.	TypicalFFC control tower simulations involve preparing a graphical model of an airport layoutand vicinity, several traffic exercise scenarios, and conducting full traffic operationswith certified controllers and pseudo-pilots pilots.  Four to 25 pseudo-pilots controlthe aircraft in real-time and communicate verbally with the controllers.  Training isconducted three days per week for three to five weeks to familiarize the pseudo-pilotswith the proficient operations of aircraft in the simulation airport.  Two to six airtraffic controllers are also required to conduct the pseudo-pilot training.  The actualexperiment normally runs for approximately one week. SimLabs customers are researchers from NASA, other government civil or military agencies,or private companies.  Simulation experiments are conducted based on customer demand,which is not uniform throughout the year.  Therefore NASA requires the SimLab participantContractor to have access to simulation participants whose schedules are flexible. WORK TO BE PERFORMED: Simulation participants are needed to support human-in-the-loop real-time simulation inaccordance with the attached Statement Work.  These participants include air carrierpilots, staff pilots, pseudo-pilots, air traffic controllers (ATCs), traffic managementcontroller, dispatcher, subject matter expert, maintenance/engineer advisor.  TheContractor shall provide these simulation participants on a temporary, as needed, basisto support experiments at NASA Ames Research Center in SimLab facilities.  The Contractorshall recruit, hire, schedule, and complete visitor badge authorization for allsimulation participants.  An understanding of the general requirements for typicalresearch conducted in simulation facilities is required.  All participants must be UnitedStates citizens and speak English fluently.  The contractor is required to maintain alarge pool of participants from which to draw the appropriate participants in time tomeet the simulation schedule.The contractor will be provided a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) office from whichthey can manage the BPA.  The on-site manager(s) will require non-visitor badges.  Thecontractors on-site personnel will be responsible for arranging visitor badges for theSimLab participants.Specific requirements for the different labor categories are as stated in the attachedStatement of Work.Task orders will be placed based on predetermined fixed labor rates (burdened).  Thecontractor may only charge for participants time spent on-site with a minimum of 4 hourscharged per day.  Travel will be included in specific delivery orders as needed on a timeand materials basis.

History  The Bureau of Indian Affairs manages 6,953 buildings located at 350 sites in 26 states across the US.  The majority of these facilities are comprised of educational and detention facilities, of which are made up of 186 schools, 65 dormitories and two colleges.  Assistant Secretary, Indian Affairs established this Structural Fire Protection Program (SFPP) to carry out objectives to insure occupants of Bureau facilities have fire protection and rescue response services.  The SFPP has identified educational facilities as being the most crucial areas needing fire protection response, with sleeping area (dormitories/detention) facilities being paramount. The majority of these facilities are located in rural areas where the only emergency response is the BIA or Tribal fire departments.  In an emergency, additional help via mutual aid may take 30-60 minutes for another entity to arrive on scene.  The Bureau fire departments provide structural fire protection to schools where grade levels are Kindergarten thru Grade 12.  This is done primarily by Bureau employees as collateral duty and referred to as call back or sometimes volunteer firefighters. The normal duties of identified fire personnel include: facility workers, school bus drivers, cooks or other related facilities positions.

<DESC><br />The Tactically Expandable Maritime Platform (TEMP) program will investigate and develop modular technologies and macroscopic modular systems that leverage ubiquitous International Organization for Standardization (ISO) containers and the intermodal transport system to deliver flexible operational capability from unmodified commercial containerships. The program has three primary objectives. The first objective, corresponding to Technical Area One, is to broadly explore the concept of forming macroscopic integrated systems out of twenty-foot containers, identifying innovative architectures, mission applications, approaches, and enabling technologies. The second objective, corresponding to Technical Area Two, is to conduct focused architecture development and preliminary design work on a TEMP humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) package. This package design will encompass modular technologies with the range of capabilities necessary to complete the HA/DR mission, such as situational awareness, command and control, and distributed micro-logistics over broad coastal areas without dependence on local infrastructure. The third TEMP objective, corresponding to Technical Area Three, is to demonstrate the viability of ocean deployed modular technologies and systems operating independently from a host containership. The program will design, build, demonstrate, and transition an exemplary system, the Modular Sea Depot - a multi-unit maritime logistics node. The Modular Sea Depot provides near term operational capability, while serving as proof of principle and risk reduction for a larger scale Modular Seabase concept.<br />
<p>The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/TTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 10-57) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time (EDT), June 16, 2010 (initial closing date), in order to be considered during the initial round of selections.  BAA 10-57 will remain open for 180 days (October 13, 2010; final closing date) after posting on FedBizOpps; however, proposals received after the initial due date will be selected contingent upon the availability of funds and proposers are warned that the likelihood of funding is greatly reduced for proposals submitted after the initial closing date deadline.</p>

SECTION M--EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


AWARD DETERMINATION 
Award will be made to the offeror whose acceptable offer provides the best value to the government, considering price and the non-price factors listed below. Non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.  

The selection official will base the award decision on a tradeoff between price and non-price factors, comparing the relative risk to the government of poor or non-performance posed by each of the offerors, and making a judgment as to whether or not reduced risk of performance is worth the additional cost.  In some cases this will result in award to a lower-ranked but lower-priced offer; in other cases the result will be award to a higher-ranked but higher-priced offer. 

EVALUATION FACTORS

Acceptability of the Offer
The Government will determine the acceptability of each offer on a pass or fail basis. An offer is acceptable when it manifests the offeror's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the RFP, including attachments. If an offeror takes an exception to any of the terms and conditions of the RFP, then the Government will consider its offer to be unacceptable.

Capability of the Offeror 
The Government will assess the capability of each offeror on the basis of the following criteria which are of approximately equal value:   (1) Understanding of the Government's requirements, (2) Organizational Experience, and (3) Organizational Past Performance.  The Government will not assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value.

(1) Understanding of the Government's Requirements. The Government will evaluate each offeror's relative understanding of the Government's requirements on the basis of its written submittals addressing the following subfactors:

a) Any information that indicates the extent to which the site for this project was visited.
b) The results concluded from the site visit.
c) The resources (personnel and equipment) which are planned for use on the project, and how realistic that plan is given concurrent obligations.
d) Site-specific safety plan.
e) Plan of work.
f) Where applicable, estimated production rates.
(2) Past Performance. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The Government will contact some of each offeror's customers to ask whether or not that: (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract (specifications); (3) finished within the contract time; (4) the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (5) the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction. In evaluating past performance, the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  Federal, state, and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases. The Government may evaluate the organizational past performance of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors.

5.  EMERGENCY MEASURES  

The table set forth below establishes work restrictions and fire precautions that the Contractor must observe at each activity level.  The restrictions are cumulative at each level.
The Forest Service, in its sole discretion, may change the predicted activity level if the current fire suppression situation, weather and vegetation conditions warrant additional restriction of activities.  Contractor shall obtain the predicted Project Activity Level by calling the following phone number  (760) 873-2555                      before starting work each day.  If practicable, Forest Service will determine the following days activity level by 6:00 PM local time.  If predictions made after 6:00 PM are significantly different than originally estimated, Forest Service will inform Contractor when changes in restrictions or industrial precautions are indicated.
The following definitions shall apply to these Project Activity Levels:
Cable Yarding Systems:  A yarding system that takes logs from the stump area to a landing using an overhead system of winch-driven cables to which logs are attached with chokers or grapples.
Hot Saw Technology:  A harvesting system that employs a high-speed (>1100 rpm) rotation felling heads (i.e., full rotation lateral tilt head).
Sunset:  The time that sunset is reported in the local newspaper for that day.
Except for Project Activity Level days Ev after 1:00 PM local time and E, Forest Service may issue substitute precautions(s) of the requirements below.  Such agreements shall prescribe measures to be taken by Contractor to reduce risk of ignition and/or spread of fire.   

Forest Service may change the Project Activity Levels to other values upon revision of the National Fire Danger Rating System and may change the specific Project Activity Levels and/or requirements when such changes are necessary for the protection of the National Forest.  When sent to Contractor, the revised Project Activity Levels will supersede the levels below.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor
Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.

http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

GENERAL INFORMATION:The Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center, Houston, Texas, intends to award a contract to set initial headstones and markers; to remove existing headstones and markers and set replacement headstones and markers; and to raise and realign existing headstones and markers.  Work consists of resetting headstones that are already in place, which have shifted out of vertical and/or horizontal alignment as well as inventory, cleaning, backfilling voids around the upright headstone with a suitable soil, and assuring accurate placement on gravesites for the Houston National Cemetery (HNC), 10410 Veterans Memorial Drive, Houston, TX 77038.  The contractor shall furnish all supervision, professional advice/guidance, labor, parts, materials, equipment, and personnel to provide these services.II.	THE NCA MISSION:The National Cemetery Administration honors veterans with a final resting place and lasting memorials that commemorate their service to our Nation.  National cemeteries are national shrines.  The standards of maintenance, appearance and operational procedures performed by the contractor at this cemetery shall reflect this nation's concern for those interned there.  For this reason, the contractor's strict adherence to the specifications shall be required and shall be essential.III.	DEFINITIONS:1. "Clean" - under this contract means: "the upright stones shall contain NO discoloration, mold, mildew, grass clippings, grass marks, bird droppings, etc.2. "Backfill" - under this contract means: "the upright headstones shall have soil tamp in the voided area between the existing sod to the vertical surface of the upright headstone which results in no voids or depressions within eight (8) inches of the parameter of the base of the upright headstone.3. "COTR" - Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.4. "Site Manager" - under this contract means: "manager on site (government facility), with first line supervisory authority, provided by Contractor, overseeing all functions under this contract and responsible for ensuring that all specifications are met."5. "Inventory" - under this contract means: maintaining documentation/records of all completed work and man hours.6. "Socket" - under this contract means: the hole in the ground where the headstone is inserted.IV.	CONTRACTOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:1. Site Manager: A "Site Manager" shall be provided by the Contractor for not less than eight hours (8) a day whenever work is being performed.  The "Site Manager" must have not less than three (3) years experience as a direct supervisor of a commercial construction operation that included surveying, soil excavation, site construction in industrial, commercial or public sites.  The "Site Manager" will ensure all specifications are being met, ensure contract work does not conflict with ceremonies and funerals, and ensure employees are adequately supervised and proper conduct is maintained.2. Work Hours: All work shall be performed during the normal working hours (8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), Monday through Friday, except with the written permission of the Contract Office Technical Representative (COTR).

The Contractor shall coordinate with the COTR daily for the purpose of establishing a work schedule and to ensure that no work is being performed at the immediate site of a scheduled interment or ceremony.  These daily meetings are also an opportunity for the Contractor to ask questions and insure he/she understands the off-limit areas, which may vary, depending on the event.  The site manager can thus assign tasks in accordance with the specifications, throughout the rest of the Cemetery, avoiding the off-limits area(s), so that productive use of labor and equipment is assured, and downtime is avoided.  If the Contractor fails to re-direct employees away from an event in a timely fashion, the COTR may then do so.  The COTR shall provide a schedule of areas to be worked at intervals of three (3) sections, at one time.4.  A list of scheduled ceremonies will be provided the week prior to the event, and a list of scheduled funerals will be provided the day prior to the service.  The Contractor is solely responsible for ensuring that no contract work causes any funeral, ceremony, procession or visitation to be delayed, altered, or otherwise impacted in such a way that the dignity or security of the event is compromised.  The Contractor is solely responsible for staying abreast of all such upcoming events and when in doubt, he/she must ask the COTR.  The Contractor shall meet with the COTR at the end of each day to determine work completed and ensure that work is on schedule.5.  Upon receipt of new headstones or markers, the COTR will fax notification of "Headstones received and ready to set" to the contractor at fax #805/349-8700.  The notification will reflect the number of upright headstones received and the number of flat stones/markers received.  The Contractor shall install the required headstones or markers within ten (1) working days after notification from the COTR unless weather and soil conditions prevent this as deemed by the COTR.V.	RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING:1. The Contractor's site manager or his designee shall provide the COTR with weekly written accurate reports identifying the following: All upright headstones or markers raised/realigned, cleaned and backfilled shall be recorded per gravesite location.  The site manager will also provide, upon request, a plan of action for the upcoming week, regarding specific areas.2. The Government shall take before and after pictures of the site(s) under maintenance, if required.VI.	UTILITY LINES COMPLIANCE:Where raise and realignment cleaning and backfilling conflicts with existing utility/service lines (above ground/below ground), the corresponding utilities company and cemetery staff shall be notified and the Contractor shall obtain any necessary permits/ blue prints and cooperate with the utilities company/cemetery staff to avoid any damage or liability, and provide a safe work environment for his/her employees.VII.	SET AND ALIGNa.	Contractor shall set and align initial upright HNC-provided headstones.  Headstones are described in item VIII below.b.

Upright headstones are approximately 42" inches long, 13" inches wide,3" inches thick, approximate weight: 180 pounds.  NOTE: headstones vary in size and weight depending on their age with regard to the production date.2. All temporary markers, floral, commemorative, or other type of decorations (arrangements) causing interference with the raise and realignment of upright headstone operation shall be carefully, and orderly moved from and per completion of the installation of the headstone, moved back to all gravesites by the Contractor.  Prior to installation, the contractor shall verify the numbering sequence and location of the headstone.3. In most cases, the contractor, using wooden clamps, is allowed to pull the headstone from the headstone socket, leaving the headstone socket intact and reinsert the headstone into the intact headstone socket without digging a new headstone socket.  If this process is followed, headstone sockets shall be tamped to proper grade prior to the installation of the headstone to the required depth so that 26 inches of the headstone is extending from the soil level to the top of the arc on the headstone.  Backfill material of suitable compaction qualities shall be placed below and around the headstones and thoroughly tamped at each three (3) inch intervals leaving the last two (2) top inches to be topsoil and sodded.  Headstones shall be set plumb, in a line laterally, transversely, and diagonally with headstones of other graves using a top string and a back of headstone string line and a side of headstone string line.  All measurements and string line set-ups shall be taken from established section layout control points, not from previously set headstones, unless otherwise directed by the COTR.  All measurements shall be made in ascending grave number order.  In irregular terrain where sloping and uneven ground conditions exist, all headstones and markers will be set at proper heights and levels to provide a flowing transition through uneven terrain.  Headstones, in all soil and terrain conditions shall be firmly in place so that the headstones are rigid with no give or play.  The socket is 18" inches deep.4. In the case that the headstone socket is to be dug, realigned and/or re-dug, the headstone sockets, (holes) to receive headstones shall be dug by hand and/or mechanical devices to a sufficient depth so that 26 inches of the headstone is extending from the soil level to the top of the arc on the headstone.  Contractor shall not dig a headstone socket wider than twelve (12) inches, twenty (20) inches in length, or exceed a depth of 20 inches that may cause the headstone to settle below height requirements.  Backfill material of suitable compaction qualities shall be placed below and around the headstones and thoroughly tamped at each three (3) inch intervals leaving the last two (2) top inches to be topsoil and sodded.  Headstones shall be set plumb, in a line laterally, transversely, and diagonally with headstones of other graves using a top string and a back of headstone string line and a side of headstone string line.  All measurements and string line set-ups shall be taken from established section layout control points, not from previously set headstones, unless otherwise directed by the COTR.  All measurements shall be made in ascending grave number order.  In irregular terrain where sloping and uneven ground conditions exist, all headstones and markers will be set at proper heights and levels to provide a flowing transition through uneven terrain.  Headstones in all soil and terrain conditions shall be firmly in place so that the headstones are rigid with no give or play.  The socket is 18" deep.5.

Excessive soil may be removed with plain water and a stiff brush (no wire brushes, bleach, or abrasive cleaners shall be permitted) followed by rinsing with clear water.  If water used in cleaning should soften the soil around the base of the headstone so that the headstone is loose, care shall be taken not to tip the headstone out of plum or alignment.  Care shall be taken to protect the turf area from damage.  Any turf damaged by the Contractor shall be restored at Contractor's expense.X.	UPRIGHT HEADSTONE BACKFILLING: 1. Only those upright stones that have been raised/realigned per specifications will then be backfilled.  Backfilling shall be done after the headstone(s) have been reset, raised, realigned and cleaned.  Backfilling shall be the last stage of this process.2.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-138-DLM and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39 (3/19/2010).

Period of Performance:  The proposed period of performance for this service will consist of one (12) month basic contract period of 496 Hours and include two (2) options to renew for a twelve month periods at 496 Hours each year.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541712 and the business size standard is 500 Employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is set-aside for a small business.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), intends to award a single, fixed price purchase order for the Disorders of Immunity Section (DIS) of Genetics & Molecular Biology Branch (GMBB), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH. The mission of DIS of GMBB/NHGRI is to advance research into the genetic bases and clinical presentation of inherited immunodeficiencies.  Data obtained from these studies informs the development of gene therapy options for these rare diseases.  The DIS has begun work on the development of a mouse model of the human condition, Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia, a congenital disorder of the immune function associated with dwarfism and skin abnormalities.  The disorder is due to mutations of the Rmrp gene.  This mouse model will provide information on the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to the disease phenotype and offer the opportunity to test safety and efficacy of gene therapy for the disease.  No other animal model of the disease exists and the successful and complete characterization of the mouse model is of critical importance to the progress of this project.

We have also performed initial experiments to generate a zebrafish model of reduced expression of the Rmrp gene that will allow studying the effects of Rmrp during development.
The specific objectives are to breed the B6.Rmrptm1 mice to expand the colony and to generate enough animals carrying the genetic defect in the Rmrp gene for a thorough characterization of the phenotype.  One additional objective is the characterization of zebrafish embryos with reduced expression of the Rmrp gene. To achieve these aims, the contractor is expected to:

Identify animals with the appropriate genetic background to be used as breeding pairs
Analyze the animals born to the breeding pairs for the presence/absence of the mutated B6.Rmrptm1 gene
Analyze the characteristics of the immune system in the affected mice
Analyze the characteristics of the skeletal system in the affected mice
Examine zebrafish embryos at different time points after injection of anti-Rmrp oligonucleotides
Characterize immune development in injected embryos
Characterize bone development in injected embryos
 
The contractor shall be required to:

Set up mouse breeding pairs, verify that mating has occurred, monitor mice for birth of litters.
Perform genotypic analysis of born pups and/or embryos by sequencing of the DNA obtained from tail snips.

In addition to the six Top Cottage round trips, the current bus schedule includes two additional round trips between the Wallace Center and Val-Kill.  Trips to Val-Kill are designed to accommodate visitors who participate in tours of Eleanor Roosevelt's home, as well as hikers and cyclists who utilize trails that link the FDR site, Val-Kill, and Top Cottage.
Service planners are currently investigating the possibility of adjusting the shuttle schedule to include two daily round trips between the Wallace Center and the Vanderbilt Mansion.  Such a change, if it is made, will have no impact on driver hours or vehicle hours.  It will have minimal impact on the number of miles operated, because this would involve substituting a pair of Vanderbilt round trips for a pair of Val-Kill round trips.

<p>C.2 General:<br />C.2.1 Health: Caprines must be live, male only (wether or intact), weighing a minimum of fifty-five (55) pounds (25 kg) upon delivery to Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</p>
<p>C.2.2 Caprines shall be healthy, free of zoonotic diseases and show no evidence of respiratory, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, nervous, metabolic, ophthalmic, or other diseases.</p>
<p>C.2.3 A military veterinarian, or in his or her absence his trained representative, will be present at delivery and will inspect each caprine for lameness or any infectious, traumatic, or metabolic condition; and shall be the final authority for medical acceptance or non-acceptance.</p>
<p>C.2.4 Examples of common causes for rejection are listed below (but are not all inclusive):</p>
<p>C.2.4.1 Mucopurulent Nasal discharge: Mucopurulent nasal discharge is an indicator of upper respiratory infection or pneumonia. A small amount of clear nasal discharge may result from transport.</p>
<p>C.2.4.2 Infectious keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye) and ocular discharge: Crusting, tearing/drainage, or any clouding of the cornea may indicate the presence of pinkeye.</p>
<p>C.2.4.3 Contagious ecthyma (orf or sore mouth): Contagious ecthyma is a zoonotic disease. Any caprine with evidence of a lesion will be rejected.</p>
<p>C.2.4.4 Diarrhea</p>
<p>C.2.4.5 Lameness: Any alteration in gait may indicate lameness, regardless of cause. The ability to bear weight on the affected limb shall not be a factor in determining acceptance or rejection.</p>

<p>C.2.4.7 Caseous Lymphadenitis: Any cutaneous nodule which holds the characteristics of caseous lymphadenitis may be rejected.</p>
<p>C.2.4.8 Deceased or moribund animals: Deceased or moribund (downer) animals will not be accepted. The attending veterinarian may elect to euthanize the moribund animal for humane reasons.

Animals shall not be added to the quarantine group during the fourteen (14) day period prior to delivery. Additions of new or previously rejected animals to a particular quarantine group will necessitate that the entire quarantine period be served again by all animals within that group. The quarantine facility shall be the location stated in the USDA Class A or Class B license. The Contractor shall notify the COR prior to the beginning of the quarantine period. The Government reserves the right to conduct announced or unannounced inspections of the quarantine facilities at any time to ensure compliance with quarantine requirements, compliance with humane care standards, and to maintain positive animal identification throughout quarantine period.

<p>C.5 The Contractor shall institute an animal health program that will ensure delivery of healthy animals to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This program will include, at a minimum, vaccinations for Shipping Fever Pneumonia Complex, Enterotoxemia, and Tetanus no later than the beginning of the fourteen (14) day quarantine period.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>*** 16 April 2010 ***
<p>There have been some more clarification questions asked about a couple sections of the purchase description as well as some of the other attachements to the solicitation. Listed below are the questions and the responses to each.</p>
<p>Question: The warranty requires a "polycarbonate sticker" affixed to each unit, with information about the instrument, its manufacture date, etc., but there is no mention of UUID tagging. We wonder if this was an oversight or if bar coding will not be required. If bar coding is required, can we combine the UID and warranty information on one sticker?</p>
<p>Response: The UID tagging was an oversight since all units with a dollar value over $5,000 must be marked with a UID. That info may be combined into one sticker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: I could not find a reference to the packaging requirements for this order. As such, should we will assume that standard commercial packaging a shipping is implied for this contract? If no, what are the<br />packaging requirements?</p>
<p>Response: There are no special packaging requirements for this unit. Standard commercial shipping is acceptable.</p>
<p>Question: It is important that we understand the conditions that allow us to invoice and continue shipping, and the conditions that would cause us to stop. Once we begin shipping unit to the individual<br />PMELs, it appears that we must wait 15 days for that PMEL's acceptance before we may invoice those instruments and before we can ship additional instruments. Does this mean that if the PMEL does not report back to us<br />within 15 days we can assume acceptance or not?</p>
<p>Response: In direct ship scenarios,<br />the only piece of information that is needed is a delivery confirmation to the PMEL in order for you to invoice. If you have tracking numbers for the<br />shipments, that is usually sufficient documentation in order to invoice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: PD Section 1.7: In the PD there is a list of products that the quoted item is asked to "replace".</p>
<p>This item will replace the following items in RF power measurement applications, providing functionality as specified in sections 2 through 5, herein:</p>
<p>HP/Agilent 432A with the following options: H, H-2, 001, 002, 003, 009, 010, 011, 012</p>
<p>HP/Agilent 432B with the following options: B-49, B-58, H05, K05, 002, 003, 009</p>
<p>HP/Agilent 432C with the following options: H07, 002, 009</p>
<p><br />Response: In the PD para 1.0 Scope, refers to what the item is. A replacement for the H/P 432() power meter. Para 1.7 states "... providing functionality as<br />specified in sections 2 through 5.." which is the Performance Requirements</p>
<p><br />Question: In section 1.0 of the warranty specification we have 3 weeks to repair and return any failed unit. In section 7.0 there is a reference for 2 weeks to service a failed unit. If these are referencing the same<br />time period, which is correct? If they are referencing different time periods, please clarify.</p>
<p>Response: The correct time period should be 3 weeks for both repairing and servicing a failed unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: I just want to confirm that the Contract Data Requirements List is a reference document for the bidder and need not be completed and returned with the bid package. This is a reference document of the quantity and timing of when data is to be delivered.</p>
<p>Response: The Contract Data Requirements does not need to be completed and returned with the bid package. It states the quantity of data that we will required to be delivered early and with the units.</p>

<DESC>Please review the following questions that have been asked and the answers that are provided.
<p>Question 1:<br />The combination of Pirhana which is a VERY strong oxidant (hence the name) and Ammonium Hydroxide is problematic and will require much in the way of safety provisions to avoid any possible mixing of the two as such mixing will be highly exothermic (depending of course on concentration, which in the case of piranha is high, nothing is mentioned about the Ammonia)</p>
<p><br />Answer:<br />For effective mask cleaning, a light Pirhana (just a few percent of H2O2, and &gt;96% sulfuric acid) cycle is a standard. Ammonium Hydroxide cleaning cycle (a different one from Pirhana) is also a standard processing for wafers and masks. In this mask cleaning system, it must satisfy:</p>
<p>1. Pirhana cleaning and Ammonium Hydroxide cleaning are separate cycles with DI water rinse in between --- they do not mix; <br />2. The quantity of chemicals used is very small (in the order of &lt;1000mL per cycle), and chemicals are injected by nozzles; <br />3. There will be interlocks that will ensure the safety of the operator --- once the process is started, the system can only be open when the cleaning processing is finished (with DI water rinse as the last cycle), or when it is thoroughly rinsed by DI water after an interruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 2:<br />Regard to the concentration of Pirhana, does the end user mean dilute pirhana or does he mean low concentration peroxide in very concentrated sulfuric.</p>
<p>Answer: <br />2-4%H2O2, 98-96% sulfuric acid.</p>

The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b)(2). The continued work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order and was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures. The contractor shall continue to provide Computer Network Operations Support for USSTRATCOM / J2. The primary objective of this task order is the continued support of USSTRATCOM and DoD-wide IO/CNO intelligence operations missions executed from USSTARTCOM J2 at Offutt Air Force Base, NE. This task order provides Advisory and Assistance (A&amp;AS) support for CNO Intelligence analysis, technical assistance, linguistic/cultural skills, and production and dissemination support of intelligence.

<DESC>The United States Air Force does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or pay for the information solicited from or provided by respondents.
<p>This Request For Information is issued with the intention of starting a dialogue with the aircraft insurance industry, identifying issues and concerns, as well as to determine companies that would be able to provide the insurance described below. Please respond to the questions below and return your responses either via mail or email to the POC listed.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The country of Morocco is purchasing twenty-four (24) new Lockheed Martin F-16 military aircraft under a State Department signed Letter of Offer &amp; Acceptance (LOA) for Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Aircraft liability is Morocco's responsibility. Therefore, Morocco has requested the U.S. Air Force procure insurance to cover the planes between the acceptances of aircraft by the United States Government from Lockheed Martin's production line, until actual delivery in Morocco. This includes a few pre-ferry flights by Lockheed Martin pilots and ferry flights to Morocco by USAF pilots. A ferry consists of a minimum of two planes flown together at one time, but may consist of more. The first twenty-two (22) aircraft will be ferried over the period of July 2011 to Dec 2012. The last ferry will occur sometime in the year 2013 for the last two aircraft. Of these last two aircraft, one jet, flown by USAF pilots, will be used for integration and characterization flight tests at Edwards Air Force Base. The other jet is a spare for the integration and characterization flight tests. These last two aircraft will be held in the US for up to a year after acceptance before final delivery to Morocco.<br />The United States Air Force is seeking information on the purchase of insurance for all these planes from time of acceptance until the planes land in Morocco. The insurance certificate signer and beneficiary will be the country of Morocco.</p>
<p>We anticipate pursuing one of the following two scenarios for coverage: <br />1. One insurance policy that will cover 22 planes for 3-5 months each, and 2 planes for up to a year and a half. The insurance coverage will commence with the acceptance of each of the 24 planes in Ft. Worth, Texas, and continue until engine turned off and all published post-flight pilot checklists are completed in Morocco. <br />Up to $50M (US Dollars) coverage per aircraft.<br />Tentatively $250,000 deductible per event.<br />All risk policy with Hull, War Risk, and Liability insurance.<br />$500M Liability Insurance for any third party suits against Morocco, with no deductible.</p>
<p>Or:<br />2. One insurance policy that will cover 22 planes for 3-5 months each, and the final 2 planes for ferry only. The insurance coverage will commence with the acceptance of each of the 22 planes in Ft. Worth, Texas, continuing until engine turned off and all published post-flight pilot checklists are completed in Morocco; and for 2 planes for ferry flight only (rolling take off from US soil to Morocco, continuing until engine turned off and all published post-flight pilot checklists are completed in Morocco).<br />Up to $50M (US Dollars) coverage per aircraft.<br />Tentatively $250,000 deductible per event.<br />All risk policy with Hull, War Risk, and Liability insurance.<br />$500M Liability Insurance for any third party suits against Morocco, with no deductible.</p>
<p>Questions to Insurance Agencies and Brokers:<br />1. Have you ever received a contract from the Federal Government or Department of Defense? If so, what kind of contract? Who was your point of contact to include phone number?<br />2. Are you willing to accept a US Government Firm Fixed Price Commercial contract for this effort?<br />3. What information will you need in a solicitation in order to provide a competitive quote?<br />4. What are standard terms and conditions that we need to be aware of?<br />5. In an attempt to obtain the maximum insurance possible at the lowest cost, should we be considering insurance for the fleet of jets or per jet? Are there other options? <br />6. Please provide an estimated price range for 24 jets from acceptance to delivery in Morocco.<br />7. Please provide an estimated price range for 22 jets from acceptance to delivery in Morocco plus 2 jets for ferry only to Morocco. <br />8. Is it acceptable for the insurance policy to be signed by the Government of Morocco? <br />9. We anticipate requesting the policy and certificate for signature with the quote. If this is not acceptable, please state why not. <br />10. Should a claim arise is it reasonable to assume it would be handled between Morocco and your company?<br />11. We expect to issue a solicitation with the award made to the lowest offer. Since we don't anticipate entering into discussions after the solicitation is issued, would you be interested in attending an Industry Day at WPAFB, OH to gain a better understanding of the requirements and to ask questions? <br />12. What certificates/licenses is an insurance company required to hold to insure aircraft? Would your company be willing to provide evidence of such?<br /><br />POC: Sandra Witter<br />Phone Number:&nbsp; 937-656-6048<br />Alternate POC: David Speed<br />Phone Number: 937-656-6079<br /><br /><strong>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:</strong><br /><strong>**Note - If using postal mail, please use the following&nbsp;"C Street" address instead of the "D Street" address listed&nbsp;at the end of this posting.**&nbsp; </strong></p>

Question 10: The Governments answer to question #9 (Amendment 0003) states,
The offeror must be vertically integrated and have in house processing capability to manufacture high temperature diode laser bars from silicon wafer substrates. Is the use of silicon substrates a new requirement for this contract?
Answer 10:
This is not a new requirement. Our understanding is that industry typically uses silicon wafer substrates however; any substrate material may be used providing the requirements identified in the solicitation are satisfied.

<DESC>Question:In the first paragraph of the Synopsis there is the statement "A/E firms must be located within a 250-mile radius of the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical and be fully A/E qualified and licensed in the state of West Virginia to be considered."  We are an Ohio firm and registered in Ohio.  On past V.A projects outside the State of Ohio our Ohio registration was accepted as meeting license requirements for V.A projects.  What is meant by "licensed in the state of West Virginia to be considered."?  Will registration in a state other than West Virginia be acceptable as has been the case on other V.A projects?Answer:West Virginia has a separate state license requirement as there are no Federal Exemptions in this state as there are A/E firms from out of state have to have a business license by the State of West Virginia.  For more information you can visit West Virginia State Secretary website at www.sos.wv.gov/.  You can also contact the "West Virginia Board of Architecture".    Their website is www.wvbrdarch.org and explains most of the requirement and their number is (304) 528-5825.

Submit to Mr. Thomas Hart, Contracting Officer, RFP VA-261-10-RP-00XX/Project No. 612-00X(by U.S. Mail)  Department of Veterans Affairs (VISN 21), 5342 Dudley Blvd, CCA-Bldg. 209, McClellan Park, CA 95654-2600(Fed Ex or hand deliver)  Department of Veterans Affairs , VA Sierra Pacific Network (VISN 21), Consolidated Contracting Activity (CCA), 3230 Peacekeeper Way, Bldg 209, Room 114, McClellan Park, Sacramento County, CA 95652-2600The following are responses to additional questions.                                                 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (as of 4-15-10)VA261-10-RP-0061/Project No. 612-001, MATHERVA261-10-RP-0063/ Project No. 612-002, MARTINEZVA261-10-RP-0064/Project No. 612-003, MATHER1.  (Q)  Regarding the three solicitations referenced above - are we allowed to submit more than 10 projects for each of these?(A) You are allowed to submit more than 10 projects for each solicitation that you consider relevant and provide evidence of experience and capabilities. To clarify, more than three similar successful projects validates experience, and up to five shows a lot of experience.  2.  (Q)  Also, there was mention at the informational meeting that the address to submit our qualifications is different than the address printed in the solicitation.  Can you please let us know us know if the Contracting Officer and/or the submission address has changed?(A)  See address at the top of this page.3.  (Q)  Do you anticipate that the expansion of the Martinez mental health clinic will be a 'B' occupancy ?   Can you please clarify what types of services/spaces will be required of the 16,050 SF new outpatient mental health facility?  Can you please clarify what types of services/spaces will be required of the 7,240 SF renovated outpatient mental health unit?(A)  First off 'consolidate and expand' are terms the V.A. uses in regard to our healthcare services; in Engineering terms this may seem confusing. So to clarify, yes, the new outpatient 'Mental Health' (PC Term: Behavioral Health) facility will be business occupancy. We also assume the remodel of existing space to be Business occupancy as well.4. (Q)  Do you anticipate that the major functional components of the building will differ significantly from those in the current facility at Martinez site?(A)  Remodel:   No; at this time we intend on remodeling the existing for office space, specifically converting large conference areas into offices. New facility: I would not consider the differences significant, more of an upgrade for patient privacy, specifically in sound attenuation as these patients are typically counseled on the unit. As described the function remains Outpatient.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  This is not a request for technical or cost proposals.  No solicitation is available at this time and requests for solicitation packages will not receive a response.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Center for Developmental Biology and Perinatal Medicine, has a requirement to develop multiplexed screening assays for newborn screening that can be automated and utilized in a high throughput environment.  NICHD is particularly interested in technologies that screen for "high priority" conditions with current or promising effective therapeutic interventions (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, severe combined immunodeficiency, lysosomal storage diseases such as Pompe disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, and the mucopolysaccharidoses), which presently lack sensitive and specific tests.  The report, "Newborn Screening:  Toward a Uniform Screening Panel and System" (httm://mchb.hrsa.gov/screening), commissioned by the Health Resources and Services Administration, identifies some of these "high priority" conditions.

A three year, cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated with an award made on or about September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will be issued on or about May 3, 2010 in an electronic format only, on this web site (https://www.fbo.gov).  Offerors are responsible for routinely checking this web site for any amendments to the solicitation.  No individual notification of amendments will be provided.  Proposals will be due thirty days after the date of the issuance of the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS 541712.

No collect telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Management on the behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS), intends to award a  contract on a  sole-source basis to Chickasaw Nation Division of Commerce, 2020 East Lonnie Abbott, Ada OK 74820 . The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2). This procurement will be awarded under Part 15 of the FAR Contracting by Negotiation.

The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is the principal health care provider and health advocate for American Indian and Alaska Native people. The IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to 564 federally recognized tribes in 35 states. The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is the health information system that supports the provision of patient care services at Indian Health Service and Tribally operated health care facilities across the nation. IHS and Tribes operate some 40 hospitals that use the RPMS. All of these facilities have Emergency Departments, Urgent Care clinics, or both. Many outpatient facilities also have busy Urgent Care operations.
Patient and staff workflows in these settings are different than in general clinic settings; users have requested a "dashboard" capability to permit clinicians and managers to efficiently allocate available resources (rooms, providers, ancillary staff) to promote patient safety and improve flow through the system.

The purpose of the requirement is to acquire or develop an Emergency Department Dashboard application that will become an integrated part of the public domain IHS RPMS health information system. 

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above. 
Interested parties who feel that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim, inclusive of references listing contact person(s) and phone number(s). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available; therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses. However, all information received within 15 days of the publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received within 15 days, the Government shall negotiate and award to the Chickasaw Nation Division of Commerce.

USGS Library Management System
Government Response to Questions:

1.  How many staff work stations (Circulation, Cataloging, Acquisitions) are required? NOTE: Each work station may have more than one module and it only counts as one.
Response:
We currently have: Reston, VA library has  30      Denver, CO library has  17             Menlo Park, CA library has  17       Flagstaff, AZ library has  3
2. How many annual circulations?
RESPONSE:
Annual Check-in & check-outs =  50,000    Annual overdue notices:   15, 000
3.  I understand that the RFI released for: LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM was for informational purposes, but I was hoping to find out if this is possible new opportunity or if there is an incumbent. If there is a contractor already performing these requirements could you please provide me with the following information; Award date, Contract No., Contractor Name, Award Amount.  Also, is there an anticipated time frame for an RFP release? 
RESPONSE:
This is a request for information, not a request for proposal.  There is a purchase order for maintenance in place.We are currently using Horizon, a SirsiDynix Product.G09PX02217 Awarded to SIRSI Corporation on August 28, 2009 for Software Maintenance for $13,479.65.  There is no time frame for an RFP release, this is a RFI.
4.   If answers to questions will be posted April 14, when is the RFI due?
Response:
Response date on RFI is April 26, 2010.
5. How many total simultaneous staff users are required by the library?
Response:       
We currently have 85 concurrent users. 
6. Are all of the records in question being migrated off of one system?  If not, how many systems are currently being employed?
Response:
Yes, all records stated in the RFI (350,000 bibliographic records, 1,736,593 item records, 623,859 authority records, and 6,209 patron records)  are in one system and will need to be migrated to the new system. 
7. Is the library currently using an Electronic Resources Management module to help facilitate the local control and management of electronic resources?  If not, should this be part of the proposal?
Response:
Yes, the library is currently using an Electronic Resource Management system as a separate stand-alone system.   If your company also provides such product and would like to include it in your response, please do so.
8. According to the RFI, the place of performance is Reston, VA.  Will the respondent be required to physically locate staff on site, or will the respondent be allowed to work remotely with periodic visits to this site (the option that will be more cost effective and more preferred by the respondent)?
Response:
No, it will not be necessary to have staff on site.   Remote connectivity is possible after satisfying strict federal IT security mandates. 
9. Does the USGS organization have its own existing set of computers, networking, and IT support personnel, or will the respondent be expected to provide these capabilities? Response:
Yes, the USGS has its own infrastructure already in place. It includes computers, networks, firewalls & Enterprise IT security support.

<DESC>The Personnel Recovery Center of Excellence project consists of three combined projects and includes the construction of a new HC-130J Squadron Operations Facility and HC-130J Simulator Facility and Infrastructure for the two projects at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. The HC-130J Squadron Operations Facility project will consist of the following: This project provides for the construction of a 2,323 SM (25,000SF) HC-130-J Rescue Squadron (RQS) Operations Facility. The new building will house personnel supporting the Rescue Squadron (RQS) HC-130J flight operations mission and contains administration, planning, and briefing facilities. New site construction at the RQS Operations site consists of rigid pavement (concrete aprons), flexible pavement (access roads and parking area), an electrical yard, a dumpster enclosure, concrete stoops and pads, CMU walls, sidewalks, curb and gutter, drainage ditches and swales, and associated service utilities. Concurrent construction (separate contracts), consisting of a Flight Simulator Facility and a Central Chiller Plant, will occupy the same site as the RQS Operations Facility. The HC-130J Simulator Facility project will consist of the following: This project provides for the construction of a 1,256 SM (13,517 SF) HC-130-J Flight Simulator Facility. The new building will house one simulator (for an HC-130J aircraft) and associated support facilities. Support facilities consist of administration, training, mission planning, and maintenance functions. New site construction at the Simulator site consists of rigid pavement (concrete aprons), flexible pavement (access roads and parking area expansion), an electrical yard, a dumpster enclosure, an aggregate surface turnaround, concrete stoops and pads, CMU walls, sidewalks, curb and gutter, drainage ditches and swales, a detention pond, and associated service utilities. Concurrent construction (separate contracts), consisting of a RQS Operations Facility and a Central Chiller Plant, will occupy the same site as the Simulator Facility. The HC-130J Infrastructure project will consist of the following: The PRCOE Infrastructure project is comprised of two main components, a utility infrastructure component and a road infrastructure component. The utility component of the project consists of the installation of new utility mains as well as the construction of a new 168 SM (1,817SF) central plant with 800 ton cooling capacity and a new fire suppression pump house. The central plant and the pump house are located approximately one half mile apart. Included with the pump house are two new 72k gallon water ground storage tanks to provide an adequate volume of water for the new fire suppression system. The existing water distribution system is not capable of supplying the large fire suppression flow rates needed to supply the fire pumps.

<a href="mailto:melissa.k.koehn@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New Orleans</a>
<DESC>The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Design Build Contract, a long-term remedy for the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) in the New Orleans area.  The purpose of the project is to provide storm surge risk reduction for the areas near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue Canals from the Lake Pontchartrain storm surge, while not impeding the ability of the areas internal drainage system to function.  This includes design and construction of independent permanent gated storm surge barriers and pump stations at the discharge end of each canal.  The project design criteria for the pumping capacities of the three canals are: 17th Street, 12,500 cubic feet per second (cfs); Orleans Avenue, 2,700 cfs and London Avenue, 9,000 cfs.  This work is authorized under Public Law 109-234.  The existing Interim Closure Structures shall remain operational during the construction phase of the new pump stations.  The most technically effective means of accomplishing the dual purpose of storm surge risk reduction and simultaneous evacuation of storm water should be given highest consideration by offerors.  The contract will require a performance bond and payment bond for the design and construction effort, but the pumps, pump drivers, and generators may not necessarily be included in the bonding requirements.  The equipment may be procured under separate supply line items in the design-build contract.  Offerors may choose to take advantage of this arrangement by omitting the equipment from their bonds, but are not obligated to do so.  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 237990 and the Size Standard for Small Business is $33.5 M.  An acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be required for award.  It is anticipated that the RFP - Phase I (Request for Proposal  RFP I) will be issued April 2010, with the issuance of a Draft RFP  Phase II to the short-listed firms in the 2nd  Quarter of CY2010.  The estimated range of construction is over $500 million. However, this Design-Build project will have a build to budget amount.  The Government's intent is to maximize the best value obtainable for that ceiling amount.  In selecting the winning offer in Phase II, technical non-cost factors when combined are significantly more important than cost/price.  However, the contract award for design and construction shall not exceed the ceiling amount.  The selection process will be structured such that offers that optimize technical/management solutions within the contract budget amount will be viewed more favorably than offers that attempt to trade off performance in favor of lower prices.  APPROACH and SELECTION:  Confident that the Design Build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem, the Government intends to procure Design - Build services by means of the Corps of Engineers, Two  Phase Design-Build Selection Procedure (FAR Part 36.3).  In Phase I, the Government will issue a Request for Proposal Phase I and from those respondents, select, based on Past Performance and Technical Approach a short list of three (3) to five (5) firms.  After selection of the short-listed firms, and prior to issuance of the RFP - Phase II, the Government may engage in exchanges of information with the short-listed firms in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  For example, the Government will issue a draft RFP to the short-listed firms and request their feedback. In these exchanges, technical engineering and environmental data may be made available and discussed.  It is anticipated that attendees to these exchanges may include some local stakeholders and environmental regulators.  The Government will then issue RFP - Phase II and from that, select a single technical approach based on the Best Value Continuum Selection Method using the Tradeoff process.  To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the Government will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data to the short-listed firms, along with design criteria.  The task of selecting the best technical approach and optimizing that approach is left to the offerors.  It remains the responsibility of the offeror to collect any additional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach.  Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3 for both phases of the RFP.  The evaluation criteria for Phase I, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Experience; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Technical Approach.  The factors are listed above are all approximately equal in importance.  The evaluation criteria for Phase II, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors and a Price Factor.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Management Capability; and (3) Socio Economic Utilization.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  The resulting award will be a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SD VOSB), HUBZone small businesses, and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars.  The selected firm, if a large business firm, must comply with FAR SubPart 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submitting and negotiating a subcontracting plan.  The subcontracting goals for this District are: (1) at least 70.00% of the subcontract amount be placed with SBs, which include SDBs and WOSBs; (2) at least 6.2% of the subcontract amount be placed with SDBs; (3) at least 7.0% of the subcontract amount be places with WOSBs; (4) at least 9.8% for HUBZone SB; (5) 3.5 for VOSB; and (6) at least 2.0% for SD VOSB.  SHARING OF KEY TECHNICAL DATA: The Government intends to provide a stipend in the amount of $500,000 to the Phase II unsuccessful offerors.  Offerors must make it to Phase II in order to be considered for stipend.

<DESC>This is a modification of a pre-solicitation synopsis that was previouly posted on 03/31/2010.  The purpose of the modification is to change the NAICS code.<BR><BR>The corrected NAICS code for this requirement is 541512.<BR><BR>For convenience, the text of the original pre-solicitation synopsis is below.<BR><BR>Description of Requirement: This synopsis is not a request for quotes or proposals. This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation is scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) in the near future detailing requirements for a supply with installation requirement entitled: Dworshak Dam Safety Monitoring System (DSMS) Upgrade.<BR><BR>The services required include procurement, installation, and commissioning of monitoring equipment for upgrading of the existing DSMS at Dworshak Dam. The upgrade will include:<BR><BR>1. Replacement of accessible, existing vibrating wire (VW) sensors inside the dam.<BR>2. Supply and installation of new VW sensors. This may involve the drilling of vertical or inclined boreholes from within the concrete dam galleries. Instrumentation shall be commercial off the shelf (COTS) instruments marketed and sold in the United States.<BR>3. Supply and installation of instrumentation / communication cabling and related hardware inside the dam.<BR>4. Upgrading and / or replacement of the Automated Data Acquisition System (ADAS). It will be necessary to incorporate the output from some existing equipment, other than the VW sensors.<BR>5. Supply, installation, configuration and commissioning of network-based data handling and presentation software using a fully compliant Windows interface. Commissioning will include parallel (dual) monitoring of the DSMS data by the firm and USACE for a period of up to 1 (one) year.<BR>6. Small scale civil works as part of the project.<BR>7. Producing drawings of sufficient detail to facilitate DSMS installation using DSMS conceptual design drawings provided by USACE<BR>8.

New sensors will include piezometer, water pressure sensors, displacement transducers, seepage flow measuring devices, extensometers, concrete stress sensors and pendulums. Most will be of the VW type but may also include sensors with a mA or mV output.<BR><BR>Any drilling for new or replacement instruments will generally be 3 or 4 inches in diameter and would not generally exceed 50 feet in length. Concrete drilling may take place both from within the existing galleries inside the dam as well as outside the dam. Installed instruments will be sealed into position using grouting techniques. In addition, in-situ stress measurement testing using the over coring method may be required to determine existing concrete stresses and the installation of similar sensors for long term monitoring.<BR><BR>Civil works will be mainly confined to installation and alteration of water drainage and leakage handling facilities inside the dam galleries, together with routing and support for the instrumentation / communication cables.<BR><BR>The supply and installation of the ADAS would be required to connect the new and existing instrumentation to the network of the Army Corps of Engineers in the Walla Walla District and to allow multiple secure access points. Data would be held on a site based server which would be supplied as part of the contract. Also required, in association with the ADAS, would be the supply, configuration and commissioning of a dedicated software package to enable data handling and presentation. <BR><BR>Other information: The solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fbo.gov) when released.

<DESC>Amendment to Sources Sought Notice - Question & Answer:

Question - The requiement description references the task, "Make initial changes to system identified by WHS Safety Manager to reflect organizational structure."  Does this infer a prior system utilized, maintained, etc.?  If so, what is in the system and what does it do at present?  Who has maintained it and populated the database?

Answer - This will be a new system.  There is not a current database and the program will be built from the ground up.  The task referenced was meant to imply start-up as opposed to capture of data from an existing system for seamlessness.

Question - This notice mentions the aspect of a site presence, but do all 2,000 employees to be tracked reside in Washington D.C. or are they outside of the region?

Answer - All employees are considered to be in the National Capital Region (NCR); primarily on the Pentagon reservation, but also at the Raven Rock Mountain Complex.  The 2,000 employees are a sub-set of the total NCR population working for the Department of Defense in Washington Headquarters Services (WHS).  This project does not include civilian and military personnel that work for the service branches, and may have office locations in the same building, such as the Pentagon.  The services requested include an on-site training component.  To the extent that WHS will not pay travel or per diem expense to execute these services, local presence may be desired by the contractor.

Question -  Will prospective contractors be give the opportunity to demo their product(s)?

Answer - The Government will not be conducting pre-solicitation demonstrations.  If during the
offer evaluation process additional information is needed, the the Government reserves the right to have offerors demonstrate their product(s).

<p>This opportunity was available only to the Adams &amp; Associates, Inc under contract number DOLJ09QA00010.&nbsp; The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $2,800 to the Grafton Job Corps Center, operated by Adams &amp; Associates, Inc.&nbsp; These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).</p>
<p>FAR Part 6.302-1 provides that a sole source award is authorized when the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.&nbsp; Center operators are awarded contracts to operate Job Corps Centers through a competitive solicitation process.&nbsp; Center operators are in the unique position, as the only responsible source, to coordinate the necessary changes required by this sole source awarded modification. As the only responsible source, they are expected and contractually required to provide relevant and rigorous training curricula, training equipment and to maintain the facilities.</p>
<p>The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:&nbsp; Earth Day Every Day, to assist with preparation and execution of the week's activities. This budget has been allocated to center operators from ARRA funds and should only be used to purchase activity supplies outlined in the booklet referenced in PIN 09-33, as well as to procure a tree and tree marker for the center.&nbsp; The operator of the Grafton Job Corps Center will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This modification has been awarded on April 16, 2010.</p>

<p>The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:&nbsp; to be directed to electric and electric hybrid vehicles for operation on Job Corps centers. These funds may be used for all expenses related to the acquisition of electric vehicles, including purchase of vehicles, shipping and delivery costs, training on use of vehicle, and additional equipment such as batteries and supplies. In addition, Job Corps centers with automotive career technical training (CTT) programs will use this opportunity to acquire electric hybrid vehicles as student training aids, to provide hands-on technical training in "green" vehicle technologies.</p>

The format example contains pre-inserted (required) project information, estates to be appraised, etc.   The appraiser shall address the other required appraisal elements to complete the report.  <BR><BR>Due to size of project / number of parcels, a cursory estimation of value for the identified parcels/real estate interests is required.  Although the appraiser is required to utilize all sources of available market data to support value conclusions (comparable sales, MLS data, assessment data, SEV data, other professional sources, etc.), a separate appraisal for each parcel is not required.  Although the gross appraisal methodology may reflect aspects of a market study or project/multiple parcel appraisal report, the appraiser is expected to apply the appropriate unit of measurement (land value, improvement value, easement value, damages, etc.) and assign a separate value estimation to each parcel. <BR><BR>An exterior site inspection and photograph of all parcels is required. The appraiser is not required to make owner contact or complete an interior inspection of the improvements.  <BR><BR>The majority of properties are residentially improved and will be acquired in total.  There are also numerous vacant/improved residential, commercial, and industrial properties that will require either total acquisition or a partial acquisition of a levee or flowage easement.  <BR><BR>It is the appraisers responsibility to estimate the value of the required Fee and Easement estates and, if applicable, identify, estimate, and apply all measures of damages (severance, proximity, parking loss, etc.) to the remainders resulting from the proposed easements.<BR>
