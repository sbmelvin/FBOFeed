<DESC><p><strong>CS TATs INDUSTRY DAY: 27 May 2014 - <br /><br />Special Notice - Solicitation: FA8075-14-R-0001-- Multiple Award IDIQ Contracts - Full &amp; Open with Potential Small Business Partial Dollar Threshold Set-Aside<br />Acquisition: DoD Information Analysis Center (IAC) Cyber Security Technical Area Tasks (CS TATs)<br />NAICS/Size: The NAICS code for this $2.4B acquisition is 541712 - Professional, Scientific and Technical Services - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except biotechnology). The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.<br />Industry Day Open Market Event: Date: 27 May 2014, from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM EDT; Location: Defense Logistics Agency Headquarters Auditorium (Andrew T. McNamara Complex)<br />8725 John J. Kingman Rd, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060.</strong></p>
<p>1. An open industry day forum to discuss the DoD Information Analysis Center (IAC) CS TATs acquisition (follow on to the $2B Software Network Information Management MAC IDIQ contract that expires 30 Sept 2015), milestones and updated acquisition strategy as presented in this Special Notice will be held on 27 May 2014, from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM EDT, at the Defense Logistics Agency Headquarters Auditorium (Andrew T. McNamara Complex), 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6217. The Government is interested in Industry feedback on the CS TATs acquisition Strategy Updates and will utilize the feedback in the development of the DRAFT solicitation. The Government will also provide new information related to the upcoming IAC TATs acquisition opportunities. Attendees must send their name, title, organization, email address, and telephone number to iacconference@dtic.mil no later than 12:00 PM EDT on 21 May 2014. Once that information is received, attendees will be provided with additional information regarding directions to the complex, parking, check-in, etc. Please direct any questions regarding this registration process to Daniel Peat (703) 767-9112 or Melinda Rozga (703) 767-9122 or email iacconference@dtic.mil. Additionally, As of May 1, 2014 all non-DoD visitors to the DLA facility without a Common Access Card (CAC) (including military retirees if they lack a CAC) must be cleared prior to being granted access to the DLA complex. Clearance requests for visitors must be submitted to visitor.access@dla.mil no later than 12:00PM EDT on 21 May 2014. Please see attached DLA Form 1818 in this posting. Be sure to include the following information listed below for your visitors. You must fill out Blocks 2 Name of Requester, 4 Telephone #, 9 Gender &amp; Full Name, 11 SSN, &amp; 12 Date of Birth. This information will be used to conduct a search in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). When you forward the email, please ensure that it is encrypted, since it includes PII. Understandably, some non-DoD visitors may be reluctant to provide us personal information through email or fax. Here are two alternatives for you to use:</p>
<p>a) You can leverage the Army's Safe Access File Exchange. This allows non DoD visitors to send encrypted emails to .mil recipients. The easy to use URL is: https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe/Welcome.aspx</p>
<p>b) You can also use the attached DLA Form 1818, completing blocks 2, 4, 9, 11, &amp; 12, and also includes the visitor's gender in block 9. This form can be password protected so that only the sender and receiver of the email may open the document. [visitor.access@dla.mil]</p>
<p>2. The Government will seek to award approximately 9 multiple award IDIQ contracts for the Defense Technical Information Center's (DTIC) Cyber Security Technical Area Tasks (TATs). Approximately 3 of these IDIQ contract awards are reserved for small businesses (SBs). The Government reserves the right to award more or fewer contracts in total or a different mix of SBs and full and open awards if the Source Selection Authority (SSA) determines it is in the Government's best interest. The SSA will consider the Government's expected volume of work, available funding, adequate competition, and the availability of best-value proposals. Each contract will have a six year ordering period. The CS TATs acquisition (IDIQ contract(s)) will be conducted using a best value trade-off source selection approach. The Technical, price, and past performance criteria may vary depending on the business type (large and small).</p>
<p>3. For the approximate 9 IDIQ contract awards, approximately six (6) will be in the Full &amp; Open (F&amp;O) Competition pool. This F&amp;O Competition Pool is unrestricted and open to both large and small businesses. For the SB partial set-aside, (approximately 3 IDIQ contract awards), the Government will establish a SB competition pool wherein competition is limited to SBs only; FAR 52.219-14, Limitations of Subcontracting applies. For SBs competing in the F&amp;O Competition Pool, 52.219-14 will not apply. Individual task orders will be competed using Fair opportunity rules cited in FAR 16 for the two separate competition pools.<br /><br />4. Interested parties are ADVISED regarding an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI). As previously posted, an OCI would exist if the Prime contractor from the Cyber Security Information Analysis Center (CSIAC) Basic Center Operation (BCO) acquisition, responsible for searching/disseminating data from the repository of STI or initially assisting a potential TAT customer via an inquiry, was also a Prime or Subcontractor competing for any CS TATs award (IDIQ contract and/or order levels). The CSIAC BCO contract holder is Quanterion Solutions, Inc. and the performance period is from 29 September 2012 to 30 June 2017. The Government is completely avoiding this OCI risk by precluding the CSIAC BCO Prime contractor from being a Prime or Subcontractor under a CS TATs award.</p>
<p>5. The CS TATs IDIQ contracts will perform research and analysis mission services support related to the focus areas of Software Analysis, Information Assurance, Information Sharing/Knowledge Management and Modeling and Simulation. Specific CS TATs projects will be acquired under separately funded task orders. TAT projects will originate from evolving/emerging Government requirements, will usually necessitate a rapid response, and will often integrate the expertise of a diverse cadre of professionals from across various disciplines. The Government encourages interested small businesses to consider teaming arrangements, partnerships, joint ventures, etc., when considering this CS TATs acquisition opportunity. Cross-teaming is a teaming arrangement in which prime contractors participate as a subcontractor/team member with another prime or team member/subcontractor and/or subcontracts/teams with more than one prime contractor. Any contractor may, for example, compete to be the prime for one team and a subcontractor for another team. It is the Government's policy to recognize the integrity and validity of contractor team arrangements and to not restrict the market, provided the arrangements are identified and company relationships are fully disclosed in an offer. The Government will not normally require or encourage the dissolution of contractor team arrangements. However, the OCI information as stated in paragraph 3 above must be factored into any Industry teaming considerations. Interested parties are encouraged to visit the DOD Guidebook For Facilitating Small Business Team Arrangements at http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/docs/dod_OSBP_Guidebook_for_Facilitating_Small_Business_Team_Arrangements.pdf</p>
<p>6. The development of the CS TATs acquisition DRAFT solicitation is still in progress. The draft solicitation will be available this summer and will be posted on FBO under the above-referenced solicitation number. Industry will be provided an opportunity to comment on the entire DRAFT solicitation, including the PWS, once it is released.</p>
<p>7. Industry input is integral to the successful development and execution of acquisition strategies for Defense procurements. In addition to the feedback you will be providing via your attendance at the referenced Industry Day Event, the Government also requests your written input on the following two questions regarding the CS TATs acquisition (IDIQ Contracts- F&amp;O Competition Pool). Submit your response to csiactat@us.af.mil not later than 4:00 PM Central on 23 May 2014. Questions: 1.) If the government decides to place a SB Partial Set-Aside based on a dollar threshold for CS TATs what dollar amount would you set it at? 2.) The Government is placing additional SB Participation Requirements in its solicitations to promote enhanced opportunities and enforced accountability throughout contract performance. One requirement in particular involves adding a minimum SB subcontracting percentage requirement via use of a special contract requirement (Section H clause). This percentage requirement is based on &lsquo;total obligated dollars' - not total subcontracting dollars. Given the nature of the research and analysis services contemplated for this CS TATs IDIQ Contract(s) under NAICS 541712, what is a &lsquo;reasonably achievable' percentage level of small business subcontracting based on &lsquo;your company's demonstrated past performance records' and based on total contract dollars? In your response self-identify as a SB or LB and your company name.</p>

<DESC>The Inspector General (IG) and the Assistant Inspector General Audits (AIGA) along with the consultation of senior Library officials prepare an annual audit plan. At times the IG and AIGA determine that certain projects on the annual audit plan require special subject matter expertise beyond resident OIG staff capabilities. In those cases OIG management will search out the required expertise to conduct the entire project through the Library's procurement function. Also for projects that the resident staff will conduct, audit senior staff determines staffing needs and at times will conclude that specialists and/or additional support staff will be required to successfully accomplish segments of the planned engagement. In those cases OIG will also obtain the required assistance through the Library's procurement function.
<p>The Library OIG plans to award IDIQ contracts to at least two qualified firms for IT Consulting services on a Task Order basis. OIG anticipates that the Task Order subject matter will involve an agency-wide range of information technology (IT) business issues such as (including but not limited to) IT: strategic planning, governance, management, operations, security, internal controls, hosting environments, applications, enterprise architecture, system conversions, information assurance, system life cycle development, web development, digitization, business solutions, continuity of pperations, cloud computing, virtualization, and best practices.</p>

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<DESC>NASA provides standardized Emergency Escape Breathing Devices (EEBDs) in facilities supporting the International Space Station (ISS) Program in Moscow and Star City, Russia to be used in the event of fire.  A portion of the EEBDs currently in use are approaching the end of their certification period and require replacement. <P> The EEBD is a self-contained vacuum sealed unit that requires an annual inspection to ensure the vacuum packaging has not been compromised and that the unit is within its certification date. There are no user serviceable parts or adjustments associated with this model, which makes it a practical unit for storage and is easily donned in the event of fire. All standardized EEBDs currently in use at NASA facilities in Russia are manufactured by AVOX Systems Inc., which is a subsidiary of Zodiac Aerospace. <P> Safety training provided to NASA personnel is based on a common EEBD model, which is used in all NASA Russian facilities. NASA personnel traveling to Moscow and Star City often visit multiple facilities in various locations.  Therefore, it is incumbent on NASA to provide standardized EEBDs, which are the same make and model, in each of its facilities to ensure consistency within it safety training program. <P> As stated earlier, all standardized EEBDs currently in use at NASA facilities in Russia are manufactured by AVOX Systems Inc.  Therefore, Zodiac Aerospace is considered uniquely qualified to provide the support necessary to ensure NASA maintains consistency within its safety training program. <P> NASA/JSC intends to contract with Zodiac Aerospace for up to 150 EEBDs on a sole source basis beginning in May 2014.  <P> Other firms desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis to the contacts provided below. <P> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 20, 2014.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>General Information<br />Title:  Combinatorial approach for identification of MicroRNA signatures as biodosimetry biomarkers
<p>Document Type: 	Presolicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number:	N02RC44416-11<br />Posted Date:	05/05/2014<br />Response Date:	05/20/2014<br />Classification Code:	Q301	Laboratory Testing Services</p>
<p>NAICS Code:	541940  Veterinary Services<br /> <br /><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong><br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Riverside Five, Suite 400, Room 4032, 8490 Progress Drive, Frederick, MD 21701, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />NCI, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), is anticipating to award a cost-reimbursement non-competitive purchase order New York University School of Medicine in New York, New York for the collection of blood and tissue/organ specimens from the in vivo radiation experiments similar to those being done on the related collaborative effort.</p>
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541940 and the business size standard is $7 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a cost-reimbursement type purchase order.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that completion of this project as described below will take two years with work ongoing for the duration. The estimated period of performance is June 3, 2014 to June 2, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />Circulating and functional micro RNAs (miRNAs) in plasma, serum or other body fluids represent a promising potential source of non-invasive biomarkers and are actively being investigated for various diseases and different kinds of stresses including low and high doses of radiation. The current study is to investigate radiation dose dependence of the expression of miRNAs in mice exposed to whole body irradiation.</p>
<p>As a follow on to collaborative in vivo experiments in mouse models including both single does and multi-fraction radiation in Dr. Demaria's laboratory at New York University School of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute plans to have New York University School of Medicine perform in vivo radiation experiments using mice and collect blood and tissue specimens that will be sent to our lab for analysis. Mice will receive 2, 4, 8, 12 &amp; 15 Gy total body radiation at a dose rate of 1-2Gy/min (Xstrahl RS320 radiator, Xstrahl, Suwanee, GA). Two groups of eight age-matched sham irradiated mice will be used as controls. Mice will be euthanized at various times post-radiation up to 7 days. Dr. Demaria's lab at NYU has extensive expertise with mice irradiation, and they have a protocol approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) to perform these radiation experiments. Utilizing the same laboratory for this work will provide time and cost savings to the Government as well as comparable results.<br />Contractor Requirements:<br />The contractor will provide processed blood samples, urine and tissue/organ samples after whole body irradiation for microarray and protein experiments as well as exosomal analysis services. The deliverables may include any combination of tumor samples, plasma, serum, urine samples or any other biological samples.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that completion of this project as described below and in the attached Statement of Work (SOW) will take two years with work ongoing for the duration. The estimated period of performance is June 3, 2014 to June 2, 2016.</p>
<p>In vivo studies will be conducted in collaboration with New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center (NY).</p>
<p>6-12-week old C57/BL6 mice will be purchased from Taconic Animal Laboratory (Germantown, NY). <br />Experiments will be performed according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and use committee of NYU.  Each group will contain eight mice.</p>
<p>Mice will be exposed to 2, 4, 8, 12 and 15 Gy whole body radiation respectively, at a dose rate of 1-2 Gy/min (Xstrahl RS320 radiator, Xstrahl, Suwanee, GA). Each group will also have appropriate age-matched unirradiated controls and kept under similar conditions.  2-3ml of blood will be collected 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 7 days after radiation by cardiac puncture. <br />Blood samples and harvested tissues/organs will be processed for various analysis using appropriate protocols and stored separately under appropriate conditions for RNA isolation, protein and exosomal analysis. <br />&bull;	1st batch of 3 mice/ each group needed for RNA samples<br />&bull;	2nd batch of 3 mice /group needed for protein samples<br />&bull;	3rd batch of 2 mice /group needed for exosomal isolation for looking the biomarkers.<br />Number of mice/group: 8 (3+3+2)<br />Number of radiation dose groups: 5<br />Number of time points: 6<br />Number of irradiated mice = 8 x 5 x 6 = 240<br />Number of unirradiated control mice/group: 8 <br />Number unirradiated control mice for 6 time points: 8 x 6 = 48<br />*Number of extra mice: 12<br />Total number of mice per experiment: 240 + 48 + 12 = 300</p>
<p>*If the mice die due to higher radiation OR due to any other reason if we need to repeat the experiment we put 12 extra mice. This is standard procedure for animal experiments.</p>
<p>Experiment will be repeated 3 times. This has to be done in as different biological triplicates to see the reproducibility and integrity of the data and reduces the probability of the false positives. This is standard scientific protocol.</p>
<p>The delivery package includes the following:</p>
<p>* Processed and preserved blood samples at various time points<br /> * Urine and tissue/organ samples<br /> * Summary of significant biochemical changes</p>
<p>Samples will be delivered periodically over the course of the 2 year project, as experiments are performed at different times throughout the study and this would be based on initial experimental data and animal survival.  Until experiments are actually in progress and health of animals is assessed, precise deliverable schedule cannot be predicted. This is typical of radiation experiments.</p>
<p>To be deemed capable of satisfying these requirements, offerors must submit a written capability statement that demonstrates experience and expertise in the following technical areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Personnel/Experience:</strong><br />a.	The contractor will provide processed blood samples and tissue samples after whole body irradiation for microarray experiments as well as exosomal analysis services.  The starting materials can be tissue/organs, whole blood, plasma, serum, urine samples or any other biological samples.  <br />b.	The offeror shall demonstrate that the proposed team and staff have previous successful experience in carrying out the requirements of the services stated herein.<br />c.	In vivo studies will be 6-12-week old C57/BL6 mice according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and use committee.  Each group will contain eight mice. Mice will be exposed to 2, 4, 8, 12 and 15 Gy whole body radiation respectively, at a dose rate of 1-2 Gy/min (Xstrahl RS320 radiator, Xstrahl, Suwanee, GA). Two groups of six age-matched un-irradiated mice will be used as control and kept under similar conditions; Control-1 for 0-48h and Control-2 for 7 days post-radiation. <br />d.	2-3ml of blood will be collected 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 7 days after radiation by cardiac puncture.  Blood sample will be processed for various analysis using appropriate protocols and stored separately under appropriate conditions for RNA isolation and protein analysis. <br />e.	Experiments will be repeated 3 times.</p>
<p><strong>2.	Facilities:</strong> Adequacy of facilities for performing the above mentioned experiments.</p>
<p>The New York University School of Medicine is uniquely qualified to provide this service as it already has a current ongoing in vivo radiation experiments with mice related to its collaborative efforts using an approved protocol.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to procure, on other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) single award contract to Resodyn Acoustic Mixers, Inc, Butte, MT 59701-9314. The contractor shall provide and deliver a production scale resonant mixer with a nominal 5 gallon capacity that must operate continuously on mechanical resonance at a variable frequency between 58 and 62 Htz without input from an operator. This is required because operating on constantly on mechanical resonance allows the mixer to reach the high acceleration rates at low frequency that are required to process the novel materials being developed at NAWCWD. The mixer must mix without impeller blades by using only vibration waves and provide mixing accelerations from 1 to 100 times the force of gravity (gs) because 100 gs of acceleration is often required to mix into a homogenous state, the novel materials being developed at NAWCWD and these new materials easily exceed the viscosity limits of current state of the art bladed mixers. The mixer must be equipped to operate with real time temperature control and vacuum control and be able to mix composite materials with viscosities greater than 1000000 centipois (cP) because vacuum control is critical to preparing samples without entrapped air. Temperature control is a critical safety requirement for mixing energetic materials and the new materials currently being produced at NAWCWD routinely exceed a viscosity of 1000000 cP.
<p>Any firms believing that they can provide the production scale (nominal 5 gallon capacity) resonant mixer, as described above, may submit a written response to the Contracting Office, to be received no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. The written response must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the production scale (nominal 5 gallon capacity) resonant mixer and without causing programmatic hardship. All responses must be submitted in writing to NAWCWD, Code 254100D, Attn: Ashley C Bruce, 429 E. Bowen Road, Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108 or by email to Ashley.C.Bruce@Navy.Mil</p>

	This action is for a bridge contract and will be solicited and awarded under Other than Full and Open Competition as a Sole Source Procurement to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).
  The follow-on re-compete procurement is currently being restructured to better suit the needs of the Fleet.   This process will take more time than the current task order has available.  Therefore this bridge contract must be put in place to continue services until the new contract can be awarded.  The services have been deemed to be available only from one source since this requirement is a bridge contract for the continued provision of the existing services and there is not adequate time to issue a competitive procurement. These services are considered non-commercial in nature and require significant quantities of uniquely skilled and experienced personnel to fulfill the Fleet deployment training program support tasks.
  Further information on the competitive follow-on procurement will be forthcoming.   
The proposed acquisition will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract and will issued under and FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation. The applicable NAICS code is 541519.  The period of performance for the resulting contract will be for one (1) twelve-month base period and include FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.  All options will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 17.206(a).  A complete solicitation package will be available for download via NECO at http://www.neco.navy.mil or FEDBIZOPPS at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or around 20 May 2014.  The solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above sites; FLCN will not issue hard copy solicitations.
 By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to self-certify may be grounds for the Government to refuse the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award.
 Contractor may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling (US) 1-866-606-8220 (International) 1-334-206-7828, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  All questions regarding this requirement should be directed to the POC via e-mail.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), with Pennsylvania State University for High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), HRTEM lattice fringe analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data to support recent biofuel-dynamometer test campaigns conducted at the APPCD Fine PM characterization laboratory. Combustion soot characterization is integral to the EPA-ORD Air, Climate, and Energy program. The HRTEM and XPS support a variety of physical and chemical particle characterization research performed in tandem with ongoing EPA atmospheric toxicology and exposure studies. The HRTEM and XPS are also cited in various standard operating procedures and quality control documents used to support the Agency research mission. Filter and grid samples from a recent EPA dynamometer test campaign with ethanol and biodiesel fuels require that HRTEM, fringe analysis, and XPS experiments to be perfor med. These capabilities in nanotechnology are beyond those at the EPA currently, and require both a highly trained specialist and advanced microscope equipment so that the Agency can continue its work in documenting the nano-heterogeneity in combustion aerosols. Dr. Randy Vander Wal at the Pennsylvania State University has the only known working compiled code for quantitative lattice fringe analysis (NASA, LEW No. 17437-1) and has successfully applied it to graphite-bearing combustion soot like those proposed to be used. This assertion is supported by examining the science literature and by interviewing those in the microscopy field with relevant knowledge. Dr. Vander Wal has successfully interpreted TEM images for EPA before and has applied lattice fringe analysis. Lattice fringe analysis aids EPA in apportioning soot from different combustion sources, which can?t happen quantitatively if it is not applied. This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered by the agency MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Samantha Fuchs at the address shown above or email at Fuchs.Samantha@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

Access to this data is not possible without collaboration.  Dr. Blackburn also has expertise in the role of wildlife, livestock, and species interaction in the persistence of anthrax disease transmission at both local and landscape levels.  He has training in geography, remote sensing, epidemiology, and ecology He uses ecological niche modeling, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and remote sensing to answer spatial questions about anthrax disease ecology, Bacillus anthracis distribution, and epizootic outbreaks. He is the first person to create a predictive model of where anthrax will most likely occur in the contiguous U.S based on environmental factor s and the presence of wildlife and domestic livestock, with directly aligns with the project needs. He has mapped wildlife outbreaks and livestock outbreaks in Texas and Montana. He also has an established relationship with Dr. Martin Hugh-Jones, another expert in this field and may access Dr. Hugh-Jones? expertise through this relationship.

The University of Kansas, Therapeutic Particles and Biomaterials Lab is the only known existing source capable of fulfilling the Government's needs to obtain a NanoCluster drug nanoparticle colloid, which is thermodynamically driven into flocculates of drug nanoparticles (NanoClusters).  The aerodynamic sizes of these flocculates must be customized for optimal delivery into different regions of the lungs (e.g. alveolar, bronchial, etc.).  This particle engineering technology must have been successfully used to formulate locally acting and systemic therapeutics.  The University of Kansas, Therapeutic Particles and Biomaterials Lab is the sole designer and developer of the NanoCluster technology and associated protocols and physicochemical characterization techniques.  Therefore, they are the only vendor possessing the capability to provide the required formulated drug product and its physicochemical specifications required for USAMRIID research and development of an inhalable formulation of antibiotic to treat acute pulmonary melioidosis.

<RESPDATE>053014
<CONTACT>Rebecca Dohrn, Phone (303)384-7314, Email ras.42227@nrel.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />The ultimate goal of the Human Resources Office (HRO) Recruitment Advertising Services (RAS) program is to facilitate a successful strategic message for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in its advertising of prospective candidates. This is determined by how, when, and where NREL advertising reaches the diverse prospect audience specific to renewable energy so as to cultivate awareness of the NREL brand. The overall success and effectiveness of this goal will be measured through quantitative benchmarks that track brand awareness, candidate sourcing, and the net increase in the quantity and quality of applicants.
<p>In order to meet the recruiting goals at NREL, HRO desires to increase awareness and gain recognition from both the American public and global community to ensure NREL continues to be known as a world-class organization in renewable and sustainable technology. HRO recognizes its recruitment advertising must attract a potential candidate, in sufficient numbers, with appropriate qualifications, and inspire an applicant to apply for a job opportunity within the organization in a timely basis. NREL understands the value of recruitment advertising and how it can be optimized to influence public awareness. HRO seeks to present a message that inspires candidate interest while demonstrating the strategic mission of NREL. Advertising has the capability of educating its target audience in the value of a career with NREL. HRO has confidence that a prospective candidate will experience a sense of pride to be a part of an organization committed to renewable energy research and energy efficiency. Furthermore, its recruitment advertising must be engaging and informative to an audience who may not have a full understanding or appreciation of what NREL contributes as it pertains to solar, wind, biomass, transportation, alternative fuels, and energy efficient building construction. HRO's RAS program will primarily target its advertising message vis-&agrave;-vis periodicals, newspaper, web-based platforms, special outreach events, job fairs, and college recruitment activities emphasizing intern and post-doctoral opportunities.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is the nation's primary Laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development. NREL's mission and strategy are focused on advancing the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) and our nation's energy goals. At the core of its strategic direction, NREL's research areas include renewable electricity and fuels, the use of renewable electricity and fuels in homes, commercials buildings, and vehicle and grid integration. The Laboratory directly contributes to our Nation's goal for finding new renewable ways to power homes, businesses, and vehicles and support the infrastructure necessary to integrate renewable energy across the nation. NREL's foundational values focus upon providing a safe and supportive work atmosphere, a leadership team committed societal impacts, integrity, creativity, and excellence.</p>
<p>The HRO is responsible for the recruitment of approximately 250 personnel per year to fill vacancies throughout the Laboratory including scientists, engineers, analysts, managers, finance, computer professionals, technicians, administrative support and other professionals. The quantity and quality of personnel required for each program varies in response to factors such as economic fluctuations, unemployment rates, world and national events, past shortfalls in recruiting, and personnel guidance established by the DOE. Further, HRO participates in outreach events to recruit top students and recent graduates throughout the world for internship opportunities and post doctorial projects.</p>
<p>Through this Sources Sought notice, NREL is seeking small business organizations with experience working with Human Resource organizations to deliver specialized experience in the design, construction, and submission of recruitment advertising services programs. NREL HRO seeks to enhance its current advertising services with a recognized advertising firm experienced in recruitment advertising services. This includes the enhancement of its current social media presence; an exploration of media options; identifying lead-generation programs specific to the needs of the Laboratory, and enhancing its outreach program to provide more exposure at top universities, college events, and career fairs through advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>The RAS program should utilize all of the tools of marketing and communication to attempt to influence qualified candidates through the decision-making process in responding to the advertisement, hence, guiding the prospect candidate to the onsite recruiter. The RAS program must focus on the NREL brand in its advertising to ensure it understands and communicates the inherent missions of the NREL with the recruiting force while complying with the strict governance to the target candidate.<br />The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's affirmative action responsibilities for applicants for employment are derived from its status as a federal government contractor. The Laboratory continues to undertake affirmative action for minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans to promote equal employment opportunity for these groups. The Laboratory makes good faith efforts to remove identified barriers, expand employment opportunities, and produce measurable results. This includes and is not limited to broad advertising of job openings; supplemental inclusive outreach efforts to ensure that all qualified candidates, including minorities and women, are represented in applicant pools; and provide careful monitoring of outreach, recruitment, search and selection practices to ensure that equal opportunity is provided at every stage in the hiring processes. All advertisements must state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Laboratory policy requires that advertisements must also state that the Lab is an "Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer" or that "All qualified applicants, including minorities, women, individuals with disabilities and veterans, are encouraged to apply".<br />QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS<br />The following qualification requirements must be met in order to be deemed a source for the subject project (NREL reserves the right to include additional requirements to be met in the official Request for Proposal):</p>
<p>&bull; Subcontractor to be reputable, professionally organized, and knowledgeable in communicating over a wide variety of media, including social media outlets such as LinkedIn.<br />&bull; Subcontractor to have experience in defining strategic talent requirements that are industry specific, to reach niche populations and attract quality talent.<br />&bull; Subcontractor to demonstrate effective copy-writing, layout and design of advertisements, ability to proofread documents, and adhere to extended deadlines as required.<br />&bull; Subcontractor to describe its background, public sector experience, employee search capabilities, and in particular, highlight its experience with recruitment advertising during the preceding five years.<br />&bull; Subcontractor to offer advertising direction in attaining quality applicants from its design and production of recruitment advertising and based upon best practices in the industry. <br />&bull; Subcontractor to have an understanding of applicant tracking behaviors to attract quality talent in its advertising.<br />&bull; Subcontractor to demonstrate previous experience and success and construct recruitment advertising to attract a unique candidate populace of scientists, engineers, research technicians, project leaders, analysts, and other professionals, over a multitude of fields, for vacancies throughout the Laboratory on a national and global basis. <br />&bull; Subcontractor to provide advertising services for university career fairs and special events aimed at the recruitment of high-potential candidates.<br />&bull; Subcontractor to facilitate, coordinate and manage relationships with social media outlets and job posting aggregators as necessary to meet the advertising and compliance requirements of the NREL.</p>

Each MFD furnished under this Contract shall be equipped with a PIV card reader with the following capabilities; All MFDs connected to the RHJVAMC network will natively support PIV requirements providing two-factor authentication for logical access to classified and unclassified networks. Each PIV enabled MFD will be equipped with the necessary hardware to support an approved smart card reader and will be LDAP aware to function in a Microsoft Active Directory (AD) environment. MFDs proposed shall have PIV that is FIPS140-2 Certified. Additionally, MFDs shall have software that associates the email profile with the PIV Card user at device which authenticates the user and embeds the senders name and email address in the "From" field. This provides the user a message in the users Sent Items file folder for tracking sent messages. Additionally, the user can send mail through any SMTP mail server, with safeguards to prevent the delivery of anonymous or untraceable messages. Digital signing for e-mail and 256K bit encryption, using certificate-based authentication to access private VA web-servers shall also be required. All PIV enabled MFDs will support automatic session termination with PIV card removal and non-repudiation of the e-mail sender via digital signatures when scan-to-email functionality is utilized. All MFDs connected to the RHJVAMC networks shall be able to utilize the government owned and furnished Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder(s) for validation of the user's presentation of his/her PIV as currently authentic and valid. 

11.3 PIV PRINTING REQUIREMENTS
The proposed solution must capture user-initiated print jobs from PC workstations, and allow only the specified user to release the print job from any multi-function printer on the network.  The print job must be held in a queue on the network and not on a specific MFD.  The solution must capture the print job with necessary user metadata to associate the print with the authenticated user at the output device.  (Example:  User sends print job from workstation on the 4th floor and then can release at any MFD, including those on the 3rd and 2nd floor, etc.)  Similarly, the proposed solution must support telecommuting employees by allowing print jobs to be queued from a home office (on the network) and released at a networked MFD when the employee is in the office.
For authentication, the user must be able to authenticate at the multi-function device with PIV to release the held print job(s).
For auditing, the solution must tract username, print job name, and date/time stamp for all print jobs.

In support of HIPAA compliance, the proposed solution must also enable PIV-print release directly from the VistA mainframe and from CPRS to prevent exposure of Protected Health Information (PHI).

Dual authentication options at the MFD - Windows account authentication or PIV authentication - violates HSPD12.  The selected vendor must provide MFDs that support two-factor authentication.

11.4 DOCUMENT SCANNING REQUIREMENTS
In order to uphold VA IT Directive 6500 and mitigate information security risk, the proposed solution must transfer the scanned images to the network over an SSL encrypted communication protocol.  FTP and SMB are not SSL-encrypted and are not authorized transmission protocols.

The proposed solution must provide an integrated PIV solution using a smart card reader and embedded MFD authentication.  User Identification must be automatic based on attributed on the PIV.

Based on PIV authentication, the proposed solution must be able to customize scan options based on user profiles or user group profile (i.e. users in the Prosthetics user group can scan to only Prosthetics document destinations) as a measure of operational security.  Access to - and the ability to see - scan, print and fax buttons on the MFD panel should be restricted per the employee's category access rights within their service.

In order to ensure patient record consistency and meet the industry format standard for electronic medical and health records, the proposed solution must provide capability to automatically generate HL7 files based on patient documents scanned at the MFD.

The proposed solution must provide users to scan records directly from MFDs to Care Line or Service Line server(s) and associated departments, with access to specific locations on the Care Line server(s) based on the authenticated PIV user.

For MFDs deployed to CBOCs, users must be able to scan CBOC records directly back to specific network locations at the Medical Center.

The proposed solution must have the ability to scan to user home directories (i.e. home folders, H drives, or U drives) and other secure network destinations to limit Personally Identifiable Information (PII) exposure.

The proposed solution must have network OCR capabilities to convert documents to searchable PDF, MS Word, and MS Excel without the need for specialized user desktop software (such as Adobe, etc.).  Scans delivered via email, network folders, and home directories should have the ability to be converted on a network server before arriving to the routing destination, therefore eliminating the need for desktop software or additional post processing steps by the user.

Upon delivery of the file to the intended network destination, the proposed solution must have the ability to provide an email notification to the user that the scan has been successful.

The proposed solution must be able to provide an integrated scan capability into Microsoft SharePoint.  The SharePoint capture integration must enable the user to scan a document directly into a selected SharePoint site and/or library and enter associated indexing values and metadata at the time of scan.  The solution must also be able to check in/check out document and set SharePoint permissions at the time of upload.

In accordance with VA IT Directive 6500, the proposed solution must provide full audit trail data on all documents scanned from the MFD, including username, date/time stamp, page count, workflow metadata, and IP address of the MFD.

The proposed solution must provide an interface for summarized reporting metrics (e.g. page counts by user, page counts by IP address, pages counts by workflow, etc.)

11.5 HARD DISK DATA OVERWRITE
Each MFD furnished under this purchase Agreement shall be equipped with Hard Disk Data overwrite; capable of automatically overwriting HDD with null information a minimum of three times after each transaction (after each copy, print or scan) must be capable of adjusting overwrite up to nine times, also provide a visual confirmation that overwrite process has been engaged after each transaction.  The overwrite process must meet EAL Level 3 certifications.

11.6 SURRENDER OF HDD
Upon de-installation of MFD, contractor will be required to remove HDD for disposal by approved RHJVAMC methods. Please include pricing for this function under each of the five line items.
11.7 TECHNICAL REFRESH/INSERTION

The contractor at the option of the RHJVAMC must provide the ability to scan to user home directories, or other personalized destinations to limit Patient Health Information (PHI) exposure. Apart from Active Directory (AD) Authentication, routing of documents should not require any additional user identification (such as requiring the user to type in their username or navigating to a folder structure). The home directory destination should not be limited to an LDAP lookup for the home directory attribute. In addition, a home directory should be able to be identified by the solution sending to a networkshare based on the User Group that the AD user is assigned to (i.e. User A's documents will go to \\NetworkShareA\Group1,based on User A's assignment to the User Group 1). Files scanned to network shares should be assigned Windows based ownership policies based on the AD user. User identification should be automatic based on features from the AD profile. Upon delivery of the file to the folder, the system should have the ability to provide an email notification to the user that the scan has been successful. Based on AD authentication, customize the scan options based on the user profiles or user group profile (i.e. HR users in the HR user group can scan to only HR workflows and folders, Operations can only scan to Operation workflows). Have network OCR capabilities to convert documents to searchable PDF, MS Word, and MS Excel without the need for specialized user desktop software (such as Adobe, etc.). Scans delivered via email, network folders, and home directories should have the ability to be OCR'd on network servers before arriving to the routing destination, therefore eliminating the need for desktop software. Provide the ability to split scanned documents into separate smaller files. Scans should be able to be broken down into 500KB, 1MB, 3MB, or 5MB file sizes. The automation of breaking the file size automatically, without any additional user activity before the file is received by the user, will significantly enhance operational performance. Provide integration capabilities with fax servers, so that outbound faxes from the MFD, in conjunction with AD authentication, will have full audit trails of (a) who faxed a document, (b) where they faxed the document, and (c) a copy of the faxed document placed in a network share or ECM system such as SharePoint. The audit trails must be stored in an ODBC compliant data source. When a user authenticates at the MFD, a list of their 10 last used fax numbers will be displayed based on the individual user. This will assist in preventing mistyped fax numbers. Administrators will also have the ability to limit what fax numbers or area codes users can fax to on an ongoing basis.

<p>This notice is issued solely for the purpose of conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. No solicitation is being issued at this time and the Government makes no assertion that a solicitation will be issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach.

<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS Announcement. Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Agency in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) requires selected individuals, both civilian and military, to maintain weapons proficiency. As Per CONPLAN 0100-08, the responsibility for the Agencies' Weapons Proficiency Training Program falls under the DTRA's Contingency Operations Division (J3ONC) who utilizes primarily Government personnel (GS &amp; Military) to provide instruction to identified DTRA personnel in the areas of weapon's marksmanship, sustainment and qualification training. Weapons qualification is normally taught by qualified Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO's) and Certified Instructors at the unit level. J3ONC maintains a cadre of active-duty military and former Special Forces members with DoD approved instructional capabilities. A number of J3ONC personnel are Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) Instructor Certified, National Rifle Association Tactical Instructors, Range Managers and graduates of Special Forces Advanced Reconnaissance Target Analysis Exploitation Course (SFARTAEC), Special Operations Target Interdiction Course (SOTIC), Special Forces Advanced Urban Combat (SFAUC), and other advanced military or civilian marksmanship/instructor courses. As range proficiency is an additional duty/task of these civilian/military personnel, the subject training must be performed within reasonable commuting distance of the DTRA Complex (DTRC) as not to interfere with their normal duty tasks. In addition, based on the fluid nature of the DTRA 's Weapons Training Program, the logistical coordination involved to support this program requires a Range with the ability to reserve ranges times up to one (1) year in advance, purchasing of ancillary materials/ammunition, storage of training ammunition, and the ability accommodate various type of firearms, range positions and distances.</p>
<p><br />Range Requirements</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to identify viable vendors who are capable of meeting the DTRA's specific requirements for Range Support.

These diseases are commonly referred to as "black Lung" disease. MSHA's regulations establish exposure level standards that are designed to reduce the incidence of disease if miner's exposures are maintained at or below the established standard. Reducing the overexposures will ultimately lead to a reduction in the incidence of disease among the current coal mine workforce. MSHA takes samples in the mine using the Elf sampling pump to determine if the concentration of respirable coal mine dust is being effectively controlled by the measures utilized by the mine operator. MSHA's Coal Division has numerous field offices throughout the U.S. that utilize this product.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sampling under 30 CFR parts 70, 71 and 90 require the use of <strong><em>approved</em></strong> sampling units.&nbsp;&nbsp;30 CFR part 74 approval covers the entire sampling system which <strong><em>must include</em></strong> the pump, battery, sampling head and filter assembly.&nbsp;Approval must be obtained from&nbsp; from both MSHA and NIOSH.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />III.

<p><strong><br />IRYS Imaging Instrument, (Specified Brand Name: BioNano Genomics) NO REFURBISHED OR USED SYSTEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. BACKGROUND</span>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) led the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) contribution to the International Human Genome Project, which had as its primary goal the sequencing of the human genome. This project was successfully completed in April 2003. Now, the NHGRI's mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals.</p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a high-throughput sequencing center supporting all institutes within the NIH. NISC has served the NIH community for over 15 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for NISC services. NISC has worked with a number of investigators seeking to obtain the complete de novo assembled sequence of a number novel genomes such as microbial strains, malarial strains, and ancient sea creatures such as the ctenophore. NISC have also explored several methods of identifying copy number changes and deletions in human genomes, with only limited success. Neither array data nor whole exome data has provided a satisfactory accuracy rate. NISC works with a number of investigators studying various forms of cancer. One of the hallmarks of cancer genomes is significant structural rearrangements in the genome. Data published so far required massive effort and expense to derive this information. NISC does not have the resources for such experiments. The Irys System would provide a quick and inexpensive tool for investigating such questions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span>:</p>
<p>The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Requirements:</span></p>
<p>&bull; Must be able to generate a human genomic map in less than one week;<br />&bull; Must be able to generate a human genomic map for less than $5,000;<br />&bull; Must be able to generate genomic maps for microbial and fungal genomes;<br />&bull; Data from the instrument must provide copy number variants, translocations, haplotype info, strain identification; and<br />&bull; Instrument must support two color detection.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:</span></p>
<p>&bull; Upon arrival of equipment to destination, the package must be undamaged.<br />&bull; In the installation of the equipment, all parts including computer must be functional and running properly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. SCOPE OF WORK</span>:</p>
<p>The Irys System provides genome maps from massively parallel single-molecule visualization of extremely long DNA without amplification providing long-range contiguity critical for de novo sequence scaffolding and analysis of structural variation in complex genomes. These maps provide dense genome-wide anchor points for ordering and orienting sequencing contigs or scaffolds to greatly increase completion and accuracy of de novo assemblies. Structural variants and repeats are directly measured within long "reads" for comprehensive genome analysis. <br /><br />Retaining long-range contiguity is critical for de novo sequence scaffolding and analysis of structural variation in complex genomes. In comparison to many of the current short read technologies, Irys genome maps have several unique features that benefit genomic research. By unraveling and confining chromosomal-length nucleic acids, valuable information regarding placement and order of the genome is not lost, which enables comprehensive detection of variants including rearrangements, inversions, and copy- number variations, as well as accurate gap sizing. Genomic DNA is not amplified, shearing is minimized, and molecules are measured in their native form in solution. In addition, the Irys System is an open platform designed to be leveraged for other forms of genetic analysis. With an error rate of less than 1% and label site positional accuracy of &lt; 150bp (stdev), data provided by the Irys is extremely high quality and useful in furthering the research of any organism under study. High throughput data generation (50-100Gb per run) necessary for large-genome research is accomplished through high-density nanochannel array with multi-cycle loading and imaging.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applications supported by The Irys System include, but are not limited to:</span></p>
<p>&bull; Sequence assembly: Achieve more complete de novo assemblies; <br />&bull; Structural variation analysis/CNV: Visualize insertions, deletions, inversions, balanced translocations, duplications, rearrangements;<br />&bull; NGS anchoring: Orient contigs and size gaps to improve existing sequencing assembly;<br />&bull; Haplotyping: Use long-range information and single-molecule readout to phase variants in heterozygous regions of diploid genomes; and</p>
<p>Strain ID: Long labeled molecules contain high uniqueness for unambiguous mapping to genomes for sensitive detection of species or strain</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D. PROCUREMENT</span>:</p>
<p>1. Irys automated single-molecule imaging instrument for use with irysChip and irysPrep consumables to analyze extremely long DNA molecules based on unique, proprietary nanoChannel array technology, Product: irys (US), Produce Code: IN-011-01, Quantity: One (1) Each.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for written information only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement. this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a soliciation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract/agreement.<br /><br />&nbsp;The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Lakehurst is requesting information, comments and questions regarding interest in a commercial or modified commercial Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) system that is capable of swept transmission and reflection measurements of Radio Frequency (RF)/microwave devices.
<p>The VNA system will be used on shipboard and shore-based facilities and must conform to Class 4 requirements as listed in MIL-PRF-28800F. Equipment will also be subjected to operational conditions aboard both military and commercial land, sea, and air vehicles during periods of operation, transportation, and storage.</p>
<p>The government's specific interests are as follows:<br />- Interested companies who may have a single box solution commercially available.<br />- Interested companies who have an existing single box capable of being modified to meet the specification as listed below. If responding to this configuration, please provide general product info on what the baseline model would be. NOTE: The government is not interested in a full developmental solution at this time.</p>
<p>All corporate and proprietary information should be so marked and will be fully protected to the extent allowed.&nbsp; The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information. The Government may elect not to discuss submissions received in response to the RFI with indivivual responders. Responders to this RFI may be requested to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittals.</p>
<p>Technical Inquiry:</p>
<p>1.1 Overview. The purpose of this document is to inquire about an 18 GHz VNA system for type-N measurement capability.<br />1.2 Configuration. The VNA system shall consist of one box solution with a calibration kit, test port cables, adapters and any other accessories as necessary for type-N measurement. <br />1.2.1 Desktop vs. Portable. This inquiry does not specify desktop unit or portable unit. In general, a smaller unit and lighter weight is preferred due to space limitation in shipboard and shore-based labs.<br />1.2.2 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The VNA shall have two test ports. Either N, 3.5mm, or K is acceptable, but 2.4mm is not acceptable. The VNA shall be free of the coupler roll-off effect, which limits the low frequency dynamic range.<br />1.2.3 Test Port Cables and Adapters. A pair of cables and adapters to create a type-N measurement plane. Both insertable (male to female) and non-insertable (male to male / female to female) measurement planes shall be attainable. The cables shall be rugged and magnitude/phase-stable type designed for VNA use. More emphasis is placed on the durability than the stability. Technical information is being requested on the proposed cables, including the length, bend radius, magnitude/phase stability when flexed, and the number of bend/straighten cycles before degradation. Preliminary cable length is between 2 to 3 feet. The adapters shall be of metrology grade.<br />1.2.4 Calibration Kit. It shall be type-N connector type. There are three categories for consideration: traditional mechanical calibration kit, one-piece mechanical kit, and electronic calibration kit. Accuracy and ruggedness are the two most important characteristics. Request information on how each category compares in terms of the accuracy and ruggedness. Sliding load is not allowed in the calibration kit.<br />Question: Will the calibration kits be able to withstand rough handling? Refer to MIL-PRF-28800F, Bench Handling (paragraph 4.5.5.4.3). If it does not comply, provide the best estimate on their durability.<br />Question: Is it advisable to keep the electronic calibration module connected to the VNA all the time? What is the best practice for the storage of the electronic calibration module? Due to space limitations at many labs, the electronic calibration kit may be stowed after use. Will that practice impact the accuracy or life expectancy?<br />1.2.5 Connectors. All connectors in the VNA system shall allow the use of torque wrenches for proper connection. In addition, all N male connectors shall also have knurled surface to ease finger connection.<br />1.2.6 Future Expansion. Is there any disadvantage, such as the accuracy and/or dynamic range, if the NAVAIR procures a 26.5 GHz VNA with an N calibration kit instead of an 18 GHz VNA with an N calibration kit? For example, will the unit still be free of the coupler roll-off effect? The purpose of the question is to see the feasibility of buying a "26.5 GHz-ready" VNA system now for possible expansion to the 3.5 mm workload later.<br />1.3 Frequency range. The minimum frequency range of the VNA system shall be 1 MHz to 18 GHz. <br />1.4 Operating Environment. Please provide the characteristics of the allowable operating environment for the VNA; include temperature range, allowable humidity range and any known atmospheric pressure limitations.<br />1.5 Dynamic Range. The minimum dynamic range of the VNA system shall be 60 dB.<br />1.6 Accuracy. The VNA system shall meet the accuracy requirements under the following conditions: temperature of 15 to 30&#61616;C, and relative humidity of 20 to 60%; worst-case estimate with coverage factor of 2; default power, Intermediate Frequency Bandwidth (IFBW) of 10 Hz and no averaging. Please specify any other conditions required to meet the accuracy.<br />1.6.1 Transmission Magnitude Measurement Accuracy. When S11 = S22 = 0, the transmission magnitude measurement accuracy shall be &lt;0.05 dB/10 dB. Request a table to depict the accuracy of the proposed configuration in each 10 dB at minimum frequency (Fmin), 1 MHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, and 1 through 18 GHz in 1 GHz interval.1.7 Accuracy with 100 Hz IFBW. Request the same tables on the above transmission and reflection accuracies with IFBW = 100 Hz, even if they do not meet the requirements.<br />1.8 Measurement Calibration. The VNA system shall be capable of performing 1-port calibration and full 2-port calibration. <br />Question: Can the insertable calibration be performed with either flush thru or unknown thru? If so, which one is more accurate?<br />Question: Is it possible to use full 2-port calibration to measure the reflection of 1-port device? If yes, is the uncertainty the same as using 1-port calibration? Should the unused test port be terminated during measurement? <br />1.9 NF to NF or NM to NM Connectors/DUTs. Request information on how the VNA system will perform measurement calibration for same connection interface (NF-NF or NM-NM). Please provide information for all three calibration kits discussed (paragraph 1.2.4). Specifically, include the feasibility of the unknown thru calibration and how it compares with other calibration methods such as adapter removal technique or separate barrel standard (NM or NF) in the calibration kit. <br />1.10 Setting Changes after Measurement Calibration. Provide the impact of the setting changes on the measurement calibration. At minimum, include the discussion on frequency, power, and IFBW. <br />Question: Is there any circumstance in which the frequency zoom-in is allowed to the extent that it meets the accuracy requirement? <br />1.11 Marker Functions. The advanced marker functions such as filter BW measurement shall be available.<br />1.12 Trace Functions. Trace averaging and smoothing shall be available, as well as trace memory/math.<br />1.13 Limit Lines. Limit lines shall be available to aid pass-fail decision.<br />1.14 Accessories. Please provide the list of accessories for self-sufficient operation to measure the DUT, such as wrenches, torque wrenches, antistatic wrist strap, antistatic mat, etc. <br />Question: What is your position on the importance of using an antistatic mat in conjunction with a wrist strap? Is the use of only a wrist strap insufficient?<br />1.15 Accessory Case. Due to space limitation of the shipboard and shore-based labs, there will not be a dedicated VNA "station". The test port cables and adapters will be disconnected and stowed until the next use. What is your recommendation on the accessory case? <br />1.16 Torque Wrenches. Please provide the extent to which the torque wrenches are required for N and for 3.5mm. <br />1.17 Remote Programming. The VNA shall be remotely programmable. Please provide options for the digital interface, and the programming language(s).<br />1.18 Firmware Updates. The firmware updates shall be performed without using an external controller or network connection. A USB memory drive is not allowed, but use of external CD/DVD drive is allowed.<br />1.19 Storage Environment. Please provide the characteristics of the allowable storage environment for the VNA, include temperature range, allowable humidity range and any known atmospheric pressure limitations</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 7, intends to award a sole-source contract to GETINGE USA, INC., 1777 E Henrietta RD, Rochester, New York, 14623-3133 to provide all parts and labor to prepare the Sterile Processing Services (SPS) site located at the Atlanta VA Medical Center, 1670 Clairmont Road, Decatur, Georgia 30033. The Atlanta VA Medical Center has three new Getinge DD 733 61" sterilizers. The sterilizers were purchased from Getinge to replace the current sterilizers (One Getinge 51" 633 SD and Two Getinge 733 SD sterilizers) within SPS. Along with the purchase of the sterilizers, the Medical Center also purchased the removal and installation services. Refitting of the space within SPS is needed after the removal of existing units and prior to installing the new units. Awarding a sole source contract to Getinge to prepare the SPS site following the removal of the existing units will allow for a seamless transition to the installation of the new units. Many aspects of the necessary task require knowledge of the sterilizers, both new and old, and fitting requirements which Getinge is intimately familiar with. Additionally, the downtime required for full implementation will be significantly reduced. Attempting to coordinate between several contractors to perform the refitting task may result in additional cost to the government as well as an increase chance of extending the downtime needed for full implementation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) intends to award a sole source contract to the Norse Corporation (Norse) by means of other than full and open competition to provide continued services for the Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP).  The proposed service will be for twenty-four months, consisting of a 12-month base period and one 12-month option period. Norse has a proprietary global infrastructure of sensors meant to attract and track activities and metrics of threats.  CRISP is a risk scoring system utilized by DOE and the Energy Sector?s Information Security and Analysis Center (ES-ISAC) to ascertain threats to energy-related critical infrastructure (as outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) and Executive Order 13636 (EO 13636).  Norse will enhance network threat analysis, provide network threat detection modules, and perform live scoring of network threats.
Norse has designed and built a worldwide capability of specialized equipment  that invite and detect malicious actors attempt to hack information for malicious purposes.  This worldwide research platform allows them to track and characterize threats around the world.  This threat tracking is provided in the form of scoring and characterization of network activities that is tracked over time and is provided in the form of live scoring.  Norse also has a specialized teaming agreement with FireEye Inc. to provide hardware sensors that enhance the scoring from Norse, to provide live threat analysis of network traffic on the CRISP participants (i.e. energy companies) network.  This threat characterization data is shared with CRISP participants, DOE-OE and the ES-ISAC to provide situational awareness of the threats and to enhance incident response.  This unique package and specialized low pricing represent a highly compelling enhancement to CRISP cyber security and the protection o f energy related critical infrastructure.  
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1], as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) <br />Consumer Option for an Alternative System to Allocate Losses (COASTAL) Act<br />Named Storm Event Database - Covered Data Availability
<p>1.  Introduction</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) and the National Weather Service (NWS) is requesting information from industry and other organizations (e.g., non-profits, research laboratories, and universities).  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits information relevant to a possible future Government investment in, or agreements to use, currently available models to generate a quantitative assessment of geophysical factors influencing tropical cyclone-related damage in the U.S. and its territories.  This RFI notice is for information purposes only, it is not a request for proposals, and does not obligate the government in any way.  Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible future solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below.  Responses to this request may be used to support the development of a future Government solicitation. It is not the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this RFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. The following sections of this announcement contain details regarding the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p>2. Background and Scope</p>
<p>The Consumer Option for an Alternative System to Allocate Losses (COASTAL) Act was signed into law on July 6, 2012, as part of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. See, Pub. L. 112-141, div. F, title II, subtitle B (&sect;&sect; 100251-100253), 126 Stat. 969 (July 6, 2012), (33 U.S.C. &sect; 3611 and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 4057). The purpose of the COASTAL Act is to lower costs to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) by better discerning wind versus storm surge damages in the case of "indeterminate losses"; that is, where little tangible evidence beyond a building's foundation remains for the proper adjustment of insurance claims for homes totally destroyed by a tropical cyclone. Indeterminate losses became an issue following Hurricane Katrina, when private home insurance providers disagreed with their policyholders over the loss-allocation between flood as a cause of loss (covered by NFIP) and wind peril (covered by private home insurance). These disagreements led to backlog in the judicial system.</p>
<p>The COASTAL Act was designed to mitigate future legal issues by requiring NOAA to produce detailed "post-storm assessments" in the aftermath of a damaging tropical cyclone that strikes the U.S. or its territories. Using output from a hindcast model (dubbed the "Named Storm Event Model" (NSEM)), the assessments will indicate the strength and timing of damaging winds and water at a given point in the area impacted by the tropical cyclone. If the assessment results for a specific indeterminate loss location can be certified by NOAA to be greater than 90% accurate, those results will be entered into a formula managed by FEMA that considers a variety of factors contributing to the structural damage of the property in question. Based on this formula, FEMA will determine the appropriate loss allocation between wind and water. The Act requires NOAA to create a "Coastal Wind and Water Event Database" (CWWED) that will permit the public to access the assessment results, as well as the observations collected during the storm. NOAA has charged the National Weather Service (NWS) with leading the development and execution of NOAA's requirements under the Act.</p>
<p>3.  Model Details</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to identify all models that are capable of serving as the NSEM and producing the post-storm assessments (in the form of verified gridded model output).   The language of the COASTAL Act is included in Attachment A.</p>
<p>a. Model Types: NOAA/NWS is interested in models that provide analysis of wind, surface pressure, water level, wave height, precipitation and embedded convective events, riverine flooding, ponding and land surface.  Additional details about the required analyses can be found in Attachment B.</p>
<p>b. Domain and Resolution: The NSEM's domain is defined as the geographical area and temporal period relevant to indeterminate losses in the U.S. or its territories caused by a tropical cyclone. Geographically, it is expected to be an overland domain (including islands) but is nevertheless a subset of the total spatial and temporal domain necessary to generate information on water level, wave height, and riverine impacts. Additional details about the domain and resolutions can be found in Attachment B.</p>
<p>c. Model Output: The NSEM's output (verified with observations collected in the CWWED) and appropriate metadata will serve to support a post-storm assessment. Functionally, the post-storm assessment product package should be comprised of the complete observations set over the NSEM domain, the complete set of gridded products, an accuracy evaluation, a catalog of observations and products complete with the temporal and spatial coverage of each, and a narrative event history for each of the risk factors (wind, storm surge, waves, inland flooding, etc.). Each of these items will be available through the CWWED for each storm that is assessed. Additional details about the format of the NSEM output and post-storm assessments can be found in Attachment B.</p>
<p>d. Model Accuracy: The COASTAL Act stipulates that post-storm assessment results (gridded NSEM output) for the location of an indeterminate loss must be verified to be 90% accurate for the results to be used in the FEMA loss-allocation formula. The post-storm assessment must still be certified by the NOAA Administrator, regardless of the extent to which 90% accuracy is reached across the domain. Additional details about the model's accuracy can be found in Attachment B.</p>
<p>e. Model Availability:  Any model used for the NSEM must be able to produce a verified set of model outputs within approximately 90 days of the tropical cyclone's landfall. In the event that multiple states are impacted, NOAA/NWS may request that separate assessments be conducted for individual states, so multiple runs of the model may be necessary in that 90-day window. The same may also be the case in the event of multiple tropical cyclones that make landfall in close succession.</p>
<p>4.  Submission Format <br />Provide a brief description (1-3 pages) of your organization and the geophysical model your organization operates.  Please include an approximate cost of operating your model, maintaining the software and any upgrades, and the approximate computational cost of executing the complete assessment for a single storm.</p>
<p>5. Submission Instructions</p>
<p>All submissions should be emailed NLT June 20, 2014 as attachments to:</p>
<p>Robert Woodruff<br />NOAA's Acquisition and Grants Office<br />Eastern Region Division<br />Email:  robert.woodruff@noaa.gov<br />Phone:  757-441-6311</p>
<p>Submissions should address the criteria listed in the Model Details, above and should not exceed 10MB or the NOAA email system may reject the message as too large.</p>
<p>A Question and Answer conference call is anticipated on or about May 30 to discuss industry concerns with regard to responses to this request for information.  To adequately prepare for this conference call, send questions to the above email by May 16.  Details of this conference call will be added to this FedBizOps RFI.</p>
<p>6. Disclaimer</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information gathering purposes; this RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. NOAA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this RFI. Respondents are advised that NOAA is under no obligation to provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and is not required to participate in any future potential solicitations on this topic. Submissions may be reviewed by the Government, including NOAA, and partner Federal Agencies and their immediate staff. The initial implementation of the NSEM is not currently funded to procure commercial models.  The Federal Government may issue a follow-on Request for Proposal for commercial models as funding becomes available.</p>

Realism accesses whether the proposed price is compatible with the proposal scope of effort and the requirements of solicitation. <br />(4) Reasonable is defined as a price that provides best value to the Government when considering current market prices, wage determinations included in the solicitation and technical capabilities of the offerors. Also, a fair price should ensure the offer a reasonable profit commensurate with performance.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this solicitation. A site visit of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of Proposals using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit Proposals that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit a Proposal which shall be considered by the NLRB. All Proposals must confirm in their offer that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)</p>
<p>The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in Proposals for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management database (www.sam.gov).</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</strong> The award will be made to the responsible Proposal whose offer is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below. Proposals that exceed the NLRB requirements may receive additional consideration under Technical Capabilities. These factors are listed in order of importance.</p>
<p>1. Technical: <br />a. Proposals will be evaluated for ability to provide all contract requirements, the ability to provide required services on the dates specified, and the size and layouts of meeting rooms and conference office space.<br />b. Lodging Rooms: Size, layout, appearance, and amenities (e.g., no charge for local calls or use of internet/Wi-Fi connections) will be taken into consideration.<br />c. Hotel Facilities/Meeting Room: The quality and appearance of the hotel facilities; the convenience of the general session meeting room location as related to the office space; the atmosphere of the general session room (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction, etc.); availability and quality of complimentary onsite parking; cash bar; and menu selections and A/V equipment will be taken into consideration.<br />d. Location: The hotel will be either in the Washington, DC area or the Memphis, TN area. In the Washington, DC area, the hotel must be located in downtown Washington, DC, within walking distance of NLRB Headquarters at 1099 14th St. NW, Washington, DC. In the Memphis, TN area, the hotel must be located in downtown Memphis, TN, within walking distance of NLRB Memphis Sub-Regional Office at 80 Monroe Avenue, Memphis, TN. The hotel should be within easy walking distance of a variety of restaurants, commuting ease from Airport, and must be located in a safe neighborhood.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance - The contractor shall provide a list of three recent Federal Government contracts performed within the last three years that exemplify accomplished activities related to or similar to the activities identified in the SOW. The contact information for each reference shall include:</p>
<p>- Contract Type<br />- Contract Value<br />- Agency/Company Name<br />- Agency/Company Point of Contact Name and Telephone Number<br />- Duration of Contract<br />- Type of Services Provided<br />- List of any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor's corrective action.</p>
<p><br />3. Proposed Total Price should be realistic, fair and reasonable in comparison to same or similar services. Pricing should be provided for the following contract line items (CLIN):</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 Hotel Lodging for five (5) days and four (4) nights in accordance with the Solicitation.<br /><br />CLIN 002 Meeting Space Rental to include one office; one general session room for 110 people; three breakout rooms for 25-30 people; and one room for award ceremony for 90 people as described above. Provide a table in a similar format as below:</p>
<p>Area&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Room Dimensions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set-Up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Room/Space Name<br />Office: <br />Registration Area:<br />General Session<br />Room:<br />Break Out Room #1:<br />Breakout Room #2:<br />Breakout Room #3:<br />Awards Ceremony:</p>

<p>CLIN 005 Miscellaneous Expenses (e.g., extra AV equipment, copying of papers, additional meeting room space, etc.)</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as Proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate Proposals and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>In case of a receipt of a large number of Proposals, the evaluation team will evaluate Proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of Proposals being considered for contract award.&nbsp; First, technical Proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those Proposals that are unacceptable in not meeting the aforementioned criteria.&nbsp; The decision to eliminate any offers does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit Proposal revisions.</p>
<p><strong>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:</strong></p>
<p>Proposals are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this Solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Proposals that do not follow this format or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>

Proposals must indicate whether the hotel agrees to the right of the NLRB to use its own audiovisual and computer equipment and, if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system or other charges connected to the use of own equipment.</p>

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 The AMC-level protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp If Internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground is located in a remote area. The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.

Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation: Name, Company and Point-of-Contact. The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit. <BR> <BR>Questions concerning this buy must be submitted at least *2* days prior to the established closing date to reasonably expect a response from the Government.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer. In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; <strong>QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED</strong>. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is NFFKPR00-14-01598 . The U.S. Dept of Commerce, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Silver Spring, Maryland has a requirement for lease of 12 Rental Houses in Grand Isle, Louisiana as follows.
<p><br /><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK for RENTAL HOUSES IN GRAND ISLE, LA<br /></strong>Background</p>
<p>As part of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) Natural Resource Damage Assessment effort, NOAA will send a team of approximately 60 field researchers to Grand Isle, LA during the period June 06-22, 2014 to conduct a dolphin health assessment. The field staff will primarily be NOAA employees, contracted through NOAA, or on NOAA invitational travel. Housing will be needed for these researchers June 06 - June 22, 2014. On any given day, there will be approximately 60 researchers staying in the houses, although it will not necessarily be the same researchers for the entire time (some researchers may only participate for the 1st or 2nd week, but not both). Rental houses are the only option for lodging in the area. The closest chain hotel is 30 miles (45 minute drive) from the field site. Field operations will be based at the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) laboratory on Grand Isle and field staff must be housed in close proximity to this facility (preferably within 10 miles). Field staff will need to be at the LDWF dock by 7:00 a.m. every morning to commence field operations and many will need to remain at the lab late into the evenings to process samples. Having staff stay in relatively close proximity to the LDWF base site will facilitate travel to/from the lab, reduce fuel costs, and minimize the number of rental cars needed.</p>
<p>Location: Grand Isle, LA</p>
<p>Period of Performance: June 06, 2014 through June 22, 2014.</p>
<p>Number of units required: We will need housing for 60 researchers from June 06 - June 22. The 60 people can be divided up in a number of ways in varying size units, but to facilitate logistics and minimize transportation cost (i.e., the number of rental cars), we would like to have 12 single family houses. There will be approximately 30 female and 30 male researchers, although the number of female/male personnel will vary day-to-day.<br /><br />The specific requirements for each house are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Each house must be a single family house, fully furnished with complete kitchen.<br />2. Each house must have at least 1 full bathroom or more per 2 bedrooms.<br />3. Each house must have at least 2 bedrooms or more per house.<br />4. Each house must have at least 2 beds; the beds may be distributed in different ways among the 3 or more bedrooms, but must be actually beds, not fold-out sofas.<br />5. Linens must be furnished for each bed; at least 5 sets of towels (include wash rag, bath towel) and at least 4 hand towels must be furnished per house.<br />6. Houses must be air-conditioned.<br />7. Houses must be clean and secure - e.g., there should be no bed bug or other insect issues and doors and windows must lock; must have smoke detector.<br />8. Must have at least one television (20" or larger) provided in a central location and have cable, satellite dish, or antenna to receive at least local TV stations.<br />9. Must have microwave oven (compact size or larger), stove, and standard oven.<br />10. Must have washer/dryer. Washer and dryer may be compact size (capable of handling 4 lbs of laundry), conventional full-size or large capacity models.<br />11. Must have parking for at least 2 full-size pick-up (1000 lb capacity) trucks per house; parking may be in either a driveway or garage.<br />12. Must have table and chairs, set of dishes to accommodate 4-6 people, silverware, pots and pans, kitchen accessories, etc. <br />13. Must have at least one coffee maker and cleaning equipment (1 broom and/or 1 vacuum) for each house.<br />14. Internet access must be provided in at least 2 of the units.</p>
<p>"The C&amp;A requirements of clause 73 do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required"</p>
<p>This procurement is being solicited as unrestricted and full and open competition. The resulting purchase order will be negotiated as a firm-fixed price Purchase Order. <strong>In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.

<DESC>Solicitation N00421-14-T-0299 is issued as intent to sole source. The Government intends to purchase on a firm fixed-price basis, and to solicit and negotiate the proposed purchase order on a sole source basis with Morehouse Instruments Company, Inc., under the authority implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by FAR Part 13.106-1(b). Procurement is a total set-aside for small business under the authority of FAR Part 52.219-6. Morehouse Instruments Company, Inc. is the manufacturer of D-540 Aircraft Jack Tester Calibration Kit with no known authorized supplier or distributor. <br />This requirement is for exact match only to ensure standardization and compatibility with existing models and support systems and minimizes critical measurement uncertainties. The introduction of a different brand or model would create system incompatibility, cost duplication and requires re-evaluations of Navy calibration procedures incurring un-necessary delays in fleet readiness support.
<p>Please see attached RFQ.</p>
<p>Solicitation will close on 12 May 2014 at 0900 EST. The Government will not pay for any information received. For information contact: Bernie Cortez at 301-995-1773, <br />FAX: 301-995-0875, or email: Bernie.Cortez@navy.mil</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3675. <BR> <BR>(a) Prohibitions.Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in, writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS/CONTRACT CLAUSES: 

FSS RFQ INTRODUCTORY LANGUAGE
C.1  FSS RFQ INTRODUCTORY LANGUAGE
  The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence.
C.2  VAAR 852.211-73  BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (JAN 2008)
  (Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
  (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
  (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
  (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
      (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
      (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
      (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
      (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.
    (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.
(End of Clause)
C.3  852.232-72 ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUESTS (NOV 2012)
  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-
      (1) Contract financing payment has the meaning given in FAR 32.001.
      (2) Designated agency office has the meaning given in 5 CFR 1315.2(m).
      (3) Electronic form means an automated system transmitting information electronically according to the 
Accepted electronic data transmission methods and formats identified in paragraph (c) of this clause.  Facsimile, email, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests.
      (4) Invoice payment has the meaning given in FAR 32.001.
      (5) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the contractor under this contract.
  (b) Electronic payment requests. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, the contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form. Purchases paid with a Government-wide commercial purchase card are considered to be an electronic transaction for purposes of this rule, and therefore no additional electronic invoice submission is required.
  (c) Data transmission. A contractor must ensure that the data transmission method and format are through one of the following:
      (1) VA's Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment System. (See Web site at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.)
      (2) Any system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) formats established by the Accredited Standards Center (ASC) and chartered by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The X12 EDI Web site (http://www.x12.org) includes additional information on EDI 810 and 811 formats.
  (d) Invoice requirements. Invoices shall comply with FAR 32.905.
  (e) Exceptions. If, based on one of the circumstances below, the contracting officer directs that payment requests be made by mail, the contractor shall submit payment requests by mail through the United States Postal Service to the designated agency office. Submission of payment requests by mail may be required for:
      (1) Awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States;
      (2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise the safeguarding of classified or privacy information;
      (3) Contracts awarded by contracting officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to national emergencies;
      (4) Solicitations or contracts in which the designated agency office is a VA entity other than the VA Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas; or
      (5) Solicitations or contracts in which the VA designated agency office does not have electronic invoicing capability as described above.
(End of Clause)
C.4  VAAR  852.246-70  GUARANTEE (JAN 2008)
    The contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of 12 months, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor.
(End of Clause)
C.5  VAAR 852.246-71  INSPECTION (JAN 2008)
  Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account.

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

Search by referencing the pre-solicitation number (above), Department of the Interior, National Park Service.<br /><br />The NAICS Code for this requirement is 237990 size standard $33.5 million.</p>
<p>This project is the first phase of the larger City Arch River (CAR) program that will upgrade and enhance the visitor experience at the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis, Missouri. This project site is approximately 30 acres in size and includes the southern area of the existing park, not including the area occupied by the Arch or the underground Museum of Westward Expansion and Visitor Center. The South Park Grounds, similar to the North Park Grounds, is made up of the existing reflecting ponds, processional walks, east slope, and associated landscape. The South Park Grounds construction contract work includes selective demolition and removal of existing furnishings, pavement, utilities, trees, shrubs, lawns, soils, pathways, and roads. New work includes storm sewers, sanitary sewers, earthwork, site electrical work, water lines, fiber optic lines, grading, concrete site walls, steel handrails, concrete and asphaltic pavement, cobbled borders, stamped concrete, exposed aggregate concrete, curbs, roads, pathways (including processional walks), ramps, tree pits, planting soils, soil amendments, erosion control, slope stabilization, trees, shrubs, groundcovers, lawns, irrigation, storm water capture systems, drinking fountains, bike racks, benches, security bollards, security systems, and site lighting. The major emphasis for this work is to improve site accessibility, landscaping, soil and drainage conditions, and aesthetics for overall visitor enjoyment and use.</p>
<p>Staging areas and site access are extremely limited. The site is located in an urban area surrounded by roadways and interstate highway. Visitor access to the existing Arch must be maintained throughout construction. The project site is part of a National Historic Landmark and is subject to related requirements including, but not limited to, archaeological monitoring, protection of and documentation of existing historic elements. It is expected that both the South and North Park Grounds work will be underway simultaneously.</p>
<p>The estimated price is between <strong>$17,000,000 - $22,000,000</strong> including all labor, materials, equipment and expertise necessary to perform all operations required for the successful completion of the above named project. The work associated with the contract will be completed no later than 495 calendar days after the Notice To Proceed.</p>
<p>Type of Procurement: It is anticipated that a negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal meeting may be posted and date/location will be noted in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which, if submitted in a timely manner, will be considered. It is the policy of the government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration Office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors at http://www.sba.gov . <br />Responses from Bidders will be accepted at the address listed in the solicitation in hard copy with the manual signature of the authorized company official. Facsimile offers shall NOT be accepted. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation. This announcement does NOT constitute the solicitation</p>

<DESC>Response to Vendor Questions 

MSPV RFI VA119-14-I-0151


1.	Question: Section 8 VA119-14-I-0151 asks - How many commercial medical/surgical supplier agreements does your company currently have on file, and how long are those contracts on average?

Is the government asking to identify the number of commercial contracts currently in place for the identified options listed or which are normally negotiated?


Answer: The VA is asking to identify the number of contracts where your company is obligated to provide medical/surgical equipment and supplies, and (on average) what is the typical contract period. Your company's response(s) allow the VA to better determine the amount of capacity that commercial medical/surgical manufacturers/suppliers/distributors have and to identify commercial best practice with regard to typical contract duration periods for these products. Information gathered will be considered during the development of a potential statement of work that is in line with US commercial industry.



2.	Question: If we have multiple divisions (duns) numbers, should our answers reflect the division/duns servicing the VA business (MedSurg), or should it be total?


Answer: Respondents to this RFI should use the DUNs associated with their company that provides medical/surgical equipment and supplies and a manufacturer, supplier, distributor, or under any other typical business operating structure. DUNs information will be used to help identify the average viability of businesses operating in this commercial sector.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award. <br>  <br> Contractor shall furnish all labor, management, equipment, supplies, and materials needed for Steel Replacement and Duct Work at Abiquiu Dam, NM. Work includes replacing a segment of metal duct which is part of an assemblage that runs from the top, ground floor, or 10th floor, and thence runs to the bottom of the shaft.  Along this run of duct, said segment needs to be replaced for the efficient transport of blown air from the top of the shaft which helps to eliminate humidity in the bottom of the shaft.  The segment to be replaced is approximately 6 feet long. Between and including the 2nd and 4th floors of the shaft are numerous secondary structural steel members that are corroded and rusted to a state such that some members should be replaced and the remaining corroded members should cleansed of rust and corrosion. Also included is the shelf angle that runs along the complete circumference of the shaft.  J boxes and electrical conduit that are rusted shall be replaced.  The cleaning of the rust and corrosion can be accomplished by power tool grinding, wire brush tools or by sand blasting. After all corrosion cleaning has been accomplished, The Contractor shall paint all previous rusted steel with Polar Industries Premium 4740 Line Pipe Epoxy - Zero VOC (or approved equal) to protect against further rusting.

Lockheed Martin Sippican and Vaisala have been successfully delivering supplies to the National Weather Service (NWS) since contract award in late 2012. In addition, Lockheed Martin Sippican and Vaisala have been determined to be the only radiosonde manufacturers producing a radiosonde that is compatible with the National Weather Service 1680 MHz Upper Air System. These companies have proven to have unique capability to manufacture supplies meeting the technical requirements critical to NWS operations and deliver them within the urgent timeframe required.
<p>The NWS has continued to explore alternate sources of supply to increase capability and reduce the risks associated with having limited sources of supply. Over the past ten (10) years, a third manufacturer has been attempting to qualify their commercially available radiosonde instrument and demonstrate it has the performance capabilities needed to meet the operational requirements of the NWS without success to date.</p>
<p>The supplies provided by the current contractors are so specific and important to NWS operations that alternative sources of supply that are not qualified would cause significant interruption to NWS operations and possible loss of life due to untimely or inaccurate weather warnings.</p>
<p>It is essential the NWS continue to procure radiosonde supplies from the two qualified sources to maintain viable sources of radiosondes to achieve its mission to protect safety of life and property.</p>
