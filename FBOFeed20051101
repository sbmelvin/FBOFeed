<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the processing and data analysis of radiation dosimeters. This study includes the processing, data acquisition and reduction of plastic nuclear track detector capsules.  These capsules were flown on a long duration high altitude stratospheric balloon in Antarctica and were exposed to cosmic rays.  The scope of the work to be completed includes: 1. Chemical etching of the PNTD sheets within each of the 3 capsules (Nominally named as Horizontal and Vertical), 2. Microscopic analysis of the sheets to determine size, shape, and number of etched pits in the PNTD sheets, 3. Data reduction to determine the Linear Energy Transfer Spectrum recorded by the PNTD for each capsule (Horizontal and Vertical) and the angular distribution of the tracks recorded, 4. Assessment of the condition and performance of the PNTDs and background contribution, 5.  Submission of a report containing the information from items 3 & 4 above. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Eril Research, Inc.  Competition is impractical because detailed knowledge and expertise with these specific dosimeters and specialized laboratory equipment is necessary in order to achieve the best return of scientic data.	These dosimeters were fabricated by Eril Research, Inc. and remain their property. As such, Eril possess the required knowledge of these detectors and they possess the skills and full-service laboratory necessary for the physical and chemical processing of the dosimeters. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 15, 2005 via fax or email.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>D -- Web Scanning and Filtering Capability
<SOLNBR>RFIforWebScanningandFilteringCapability
<RESPDATE>120105

<DESC>Web Scanning and Filtering Capability
1.0	TECHNICAL INFORMATION
DISA is considering the deployment of a web scanning and filtering capability to check for and remove viruses and malicious code from web traffic as it enters the DoD unclassified network.  The concept being considered is to place the web scanning and filtering devices at points where the DoD networks connect with the Internet, and have them scan:

·	traffic from the internet bound for DoD web servers and the replies
·	traffic from DoD sites bound for the internet and the replies.

The current DoD architecture is modeled after a service provider environment. As such, each connection point between the DoD Network and the public Internet is an independent node. This design, which provides for resiliency and redundancy, also allows asymmetric routing of traffic.  Therefore its possible that asymmetric routing does occur, in that a web request may exit one peering location while the reply comes back via a second.  Therefore, the web filters must not require state information between request and replies.  

Management of the web filter devices will be done centrally.  The ability to adjust policies on a single device, independent of the others, or globally to all devices is needed.  Support for SNMP v3 is desired for, at a minimum, device health checks.  Additionally, some method of reporting activity and blocks that have occurred is required (e-mail, SNMP, web page, etc).  

The ideal architecture will have the web filter connected to the DoD premise routers.  The premise router will port forward all http/https traffic (and any other ports considered necessary for example 8080) to the web filter.  The web filter will review each packet, take action according to its policy, and return approved packets to the premise router for further routing.  The web filter should not maintain state information to match replies to request, but should simply check each packet against its policy and make the appropriate decision.

Currently, the DoD premise router connections to the Internet are OC-12 rates and possible web filter devices must be capable of supporting these speeds either individually, through a cluster capability, or other capability provided by the vendor.

DISA is interested in hearing from any vendor who has a product that they believe can work in this environment.  A technical discussion of the device is desired to ascertain its capabilities and suitability for deployment at the DoD premise routers

No procurement will be done based on this RFI.  It may lead to a web filter pilot effort that will assist DISA in further defining requirements and the concept of operations.  If a pilot appears to provide a useful capability DISA may decide to develop a separate RFP for the web filtering capability.  Responding to this RFI or participating in a possible web filter pilot will have no affect on the outcome of a possible RFP and responses to a possible RFP will not be limited to those who responded to this RFI.

2.0	INSTRUCTIONS FOR RFI SUBMISSION 
2.1	Submissions
Vendor RFI responses must be received by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on December 1st, 2005.  Please limit responses to ten pages including addendums, attachments, appendices.  E-mail responses are preferred.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR ISR DATALINKS AVAILABILITY PARTNERSHIP (IDAP).  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MLME) intends to initiate award discussions with the intent to make an award, based upon other than full-and-open competition, in accordance with10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), to L-3 Communications Systems – West , Salt Lake City, UT, a Large Business.  The overall objective of this acquisition is to double production rates and reduce production cycle times by 30% for the ISR Datalink systems deployed on  Predator/Predator-B, Global Hawk, MP-CDL/IRON-T2, and TARS platforms.  L3 Communications is the sole source supplier for these datalinks and datalink production capacities and cycle times are the current long poles in the overall ISR Weapon System acquisition process.  This proposed ManTech effort will address these production rate and cycle time limitations by addressing and eliminating bottlenecks associated with the component and system level testing processes.  This effort will also develop and deploy new intermediate testing processes to reduce cycle times through the reduction of scrap/rework/repair loops now common under present production.  Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<ARCHDATE>01132006
<CONTACT>ethan mueller , 703-325-2090
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform Industry that the Government intends to insert the following language into Section M of the final version of the Infrastructure Modernization (IMOD) Request for Proposal (RFP): The eligibility for a portion of the contract awards may be limited based on the size of the Offeror.  The Government intends to award up to eight (8) IDIQ contracts, in two groups as detailed below.  The Government anticipates that up to six (6) awards wi ll be made to those Offerors whose proposals represent the best value to the Government.  This first group of awards will be made without regard to the size of the Offeror.  Subsequently, the Government intends to award an additional group of up to two (2)  awards to the small business Offerors whose proposals represent the best value to the Government.  This second group of awards is reserved for small businesses.  In the event that up to two (2) small business awardees have not been selected as a result of  the small business reservation process, the Government reserves the right to make up to eight (8) contract awards instead of six (6) contract awards without regard to the size of the Offeror(s).  The Government also reserves the right to make no, one, or multiple awards. In the event the Government establishes a competitive range pursuant to FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition, such a competitive range will be established without regard to the size of the Offerors.  Separate competitive ranges w ill not be made for the first and second group of awards. All contract award decisions will be determined based upon the evaluation of each Offeror's complete proposal against the evaluation criteria identified below regardless of the Offerors size.  All proposals will be considered in the size category, or cate gories, for which the Offeror is qualified (e.g., small business Offerors will be considered for both the first group of awards as well as the reserved small business awards, large business Offerors will be considered for only the first group of awards and  not for the reserved small business awards unless up to two (2) small business awardees have not been selected as a result of the small business reservation process). In addition, the Government has posted Questions and Answers (Amendment 7 to USASNOTE04095) to comments that were received by the Government from Industry on 23 September 2005 in response to the Second Draft IMOD RFP.  The responses to these questions will  be incorporated into the Final IMOD RFP which will be forthcoming soon with a tentative IMOD schedule.  Any and all comments and questions that have been submitted after 23 September 2005 will either be addressed in the Final IMOD RFP or posted at a later  date.  For the purposes of clarification, Amendment 6 to the Second Draft IMOD RFP did not incorporate any changes.  Amendment 6 just simply extended the timeframe for the Draft RFPs availability on the ASFI Web Site until 14 November 2005.  Please direct all questions regarding this IMOD acquisition to Ethan Mueller, ITEC4 via either Phone: (703)-325-2090 or via E-Mail at ethan.mueller@itec4.army.mil.  The Government will continue to notify Industry of all announcements and postings related t o the IMOD acquisition via the FedBizopps.  The Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business Web Site will continue to be the only source for all future postings and documents related to the IMOD acquisition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Amendment #3 This requirement is estimated to exceed $175,000, therefore the Trade Agreements Clause 52.225-5 should be included instead of the Buy American Act-Supplies Clause 52.225-1, in the clause section of this RFQ. Amendment #2 Technical Questions Question #1:   In point number 14 of RFQ-OH-06-00007, does the specification require analysis of intact proteins (molecular weight assignment), identification from protein digests, or both? Additionally, is it acceptable to submit a quote with the option for a second computer? Answer: The EPA will be looking at  whole proteins and comparative analysis of different proteins after chemical treatment. This will not require sequencing subroutines, the EPA is looking at results at a rather bulk macroscale level, rather than elucidating molecular structures of individual molecules.  The EPA's requirement  requires the ability to do comparative analysis of chromatographs and mass spectra between samples. An offeror can submit an option for second computer in its quote, but the EPA budget constraints will determine the purchase of any optional items.   Amendment #1 Technical Questions  Question #1:  Requirement:  "Software for performing metabonomics analysis of data."  Please detail the type of data analysis/data reduction desired in terms of Metabonomics analysis of data.  Metabolomics is quite a large area of study.   EPA Answer:  The EPA requires Metabolite software to conduct comparative  analysis between samples, independent of sample size.   Question #2:  Requirement:  "Combined Electrospray Ionization (ESI) and Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion source".   Is this to say that the EPA does not need or want dedicated ESI or APCI sources in the instrument proposal.   The dual ESI/APCI sources are not as sensitive as the dedicated ion sources.  EPA Answer:  The EPA will accept alternate quotes for separate ESI and APCI sources, but it is expected that quotes include the cost breakdown for the option between combined sources and separate sources.  In addition,  the contractor shall provide technical documentation in support of each of the proposed approaches. The last day for technical questions is Thursday October 27, 2005 by 3:00PM (EST). Quadrapole/Time of Flight (Q-TOF) Tandem Mass Spectrometer    This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for  commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 334516.  The  specifications for the Quadrapole/Time of Flight (Q-TOF) Tandem Mass Spectrometer are as follows: Specifications and Requirements 1) Hardware interface with an Agilent 1100 Serice HPLC, with software capable of directly interfacing, recognizing and controlling the HPLC pump, and obtaining data  from ancillary Agilent 1100 equipment, including a photodiode array detector and fluorescence detector; 2) Quadrapole mass filter for precursor up to at least m/z 4000; 3) Mass resolution of at minimum 17500 (FWHM); 4) Mass accuracy of at least 3ppm; 5) Mass range between 20 and at minimum 40000  m/z; 6) Minimum acquisition rate 20 spectra/sec as written to disk (full quadrapole mass range); 7) Minimum 2GHz sampling rate; 8) Minimum one working week training course in the utilization and training on the MS (on-site); 9) Demonstrated at least four orders of magnitude in linear response; 10)  ToF Orthogonal ion source; 11)  Combined Electrospray Ionization and Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources; 12) Data acquisition software capable of interfacing with an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC pump and ancillary equipment; 13)  Inclusion of a data system compatible with the  MS; 14) Robust analysis software for the interpretation, analysis and identification of peaks and protein analysis; 15)  Software for performing metabonomics analysis of data. 1.0	Demonstration Units The EPA will accept demonstration units that are less than one year old. 2.0	Minimum Warranty  Requirements The unit shall be covered for a minimum of one (1) full year under the original manufacturer's warranty.  3.0	Installation Requirements The contractor shall be required to install the unit on-site interfacing the mass spectrometer to the existing HPLC unit.

Technical POC/ Program Manager, Mr. Fred Rahrig, (315) 330-3906, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-3906, email: Fred.Rahrig@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and advanced development in Commercial Imagery Archive & Information Dissemination (CIAID).  Research and Development (R&D) efforts shall be directed to provide advancements in the Commercial Imagery (CI) based technology areas to support Air Force and DOD operational missions.  These areas include improved digital geospatial dissemination capabilities, permitting rapid dissemination of large data sets through electronic means; spectral technology, including the integration and fusion of spectral imagery and geospatial data in relationship to intelligence exploitation and support to military operations; and improved speed and accuracy methods for generating and performing digital geographic and geolocation mensuration.  This program will develop, employ and exploit technologies to provide advanced prototype capabilities for potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies to provide continued spiral development over the seven year program.  Objective:  The application of CI resources has shown great potential to contribute to the defense information and intelligence mission in the areas of surveillance and reconnaissance, mission planning, target graphics and product generation.  This procurement will assist the government in the establishment of a CIAID R&D Facility, a center of excellence, for technical development of CI technologies, supporting prototype demonstrations of these technologies, and evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies to appropriate organizations and systems.  These organizations and systems are expected to include the 480th Intelligence Wing (480 IW), 36th Intelligence Squadron, Geospatial Product Library Sites, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and others as applicable.  Technical Background: The Air Force and other DOD organizations have fostered the use of CI to augment various requirements to support operational missions for the past several years.  For the most part, the results have been widely accepted, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information production technologies.  Selected CI related processes have begun to filter into standard production operations, some of which are prototypes.  It is envisioned that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated research, development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid CI technology insertion.  Innovative CIAID Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative CIAID research and development.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION FOR CIAID WHITE PAPERS. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the CIAID PRDA to AFRL/IFEC, ATTN: Fred Rahrig, Ref. PRDA 03-07-IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505 no earlier than thirty (30) days after the publication of this PRDA. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  White Papers will be accepted until 30 Sept 2009.  It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year, e.g., April, to maximize the possibility of award.  However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year.  The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA.  Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.  White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, an e-mail address, and a fax number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 03-07-IFKA.  Awards:  Awards will normally range from 12 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts, per award. Contractor teaming is encouraged.  The total value for all awards under this PRDA is not anticipated to exceed $17,000,000.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA.  Deliverables will be advanced prototype software applications and integrated system solutions.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness.  In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort.  Experience with, and access to, CIAID migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work.  Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government.  White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Government Furnished Information/Equipment (GFI/GFE): Required GFI/GFE shall be specified in the white papers for evaluation.  No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary for a CIAID award.  However, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  As such, depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require facility clearance and safeguarding capability up to TOP SECRET; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for the appropriate access up to TOP SECRET SI/TK information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  The e-mail must reference the title and PRDA 03-07-IFKA.  Technical questions during the white paper development phase of this acquisition should be e-mailed directly to the Program Manager, Fred Rahrig at: Fred.Rahrig@rl.af.mil. Questions and answers will be posted to http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda03xx/CIAIDQ&A.html within 48 hours after collection, thereby providing adequate time for the response. Questions of a contractual or administrative nature should be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  Questions will be answered on a non-attribution basis. Questions, clarifications, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.  Questions and answers may be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities site within 48 hours after collection, thereby providing adequate time for the response.  A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  An informational briefing/industry day is not planned.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer within and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2009.

<SUBJECT>99--Request for Information for a shuttle bus service running from Estes Park, CO to Rocky Mountain National Park.
<DESC>ROMO Shuttle Bus Service Acquisition This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).   The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback regarding the development of the acquisition strategy and request for proposal for a new shuttle service being proposed to service Rocky Mountain National Park.  The purpose of the acquisition is to link the gateway community of Estes Park with the existing shuttle system in Rocky Mountain National Park.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  An experimental shuttle service is being proposed to link the gateway community of Estes Park, Colorado with the existing shuttle system in Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO).  ROMO has contracted for a Visitor Shuttle Transportation System within the park boundaries since 1978.  The current system is very popular with visitors and is a critical tool in meeting the park's visitor management goals.  Transportation Studies in 2000-2002 strongly recommend a seamless transportation system between the park and the gateway community of Estes Park.  This type of system will encourage visitors to leave their vehicles outside the park and serve as a means to help manage congestion.  This proposed experimental service will operate approximately 12 hours per day from approx. July 4th weekend through Labor Day weekend.  The route will be from Estes Park's new visitor center to the park's existing shuttle staging area on the Bear Lake Road, with one stop at the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center.  The distance is 8 miles one way. The timed round trip route is 1 hour, thus there is proposed 12 daily trips between the park and the town on an hourly basis.  Approx. 69 days x 13 hours = 897 service hours.  SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:  Visitor Safety - minimum criteria for the one shuttle bus on this route to maximize visitor safety and convenience.  At a minimum, the bus on this route must:  -	be no older than 10 years, -	be a maximum of 35 feet in length and seat 28 adult passengers, -	meet USDOT, OSHA and CDOT safety standards, -	meet current state and federal emissions standards and be tested regularly, -	meet ADA requirements, such that they are able to accommodate physically challenged riders, Lift U or Ricon wheelchair lift or equivalent, -	have large viewing windows, heating and air conditioning to maintain the passenger compartment at temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees F.,  -	have  entry/exit locations at both front and back of the bus and must offload on the right side, -	include interior railings for standees to hold onto, -	be free of advertising, unless provided by the NPS. -	be of a neutral color, such as white or light beige, to ensure a measure of conformity with the existing  shuttle system in the park. -	The internal seating area and windows must be cleaned daily. The bus must be washed a minimum of twice weekly. All cleaning, maintenance and fueling must be arranged for in the community of Estes Park. There are no facilities within Rocky Mountain National Park. ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES:  The purpose of this RFI is to gain market research in order to determine the level of interest from potential contractors, in order to formulate the proper acquisition strategy.  PERFORMANCE-BASED:  Proposals will be solicited using performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Performance Work Statement approach to define the requirements.   TERM:  The contract term is anticipated to include a base period of one year, with four one-year options to extend the contract at the Governments discretion. SUBMITTAL:  If interested, please submit a summary business plan, including estimated cost, that addresses the proposed projected identified above.  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Responses to this RFI should be in a Word.doc, not to exceed ten (10) pages.  Responses should be submitted, via e-mail, to Katie Hoover at the following address katie_hoover@nps.gov or via fax at 303-969-2992.  Responses must be submitted no later than November 30, 2005.

NOAA/NESDIS is dedicated to providing timely access to global 
environmental data from satellites and other sources to promote, 
protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life. To fulfill its responsibilities, NESDIS acquires and manages the Nation’s operational environmental satellites, provides data, and information services, and conducts related research. 
NESDIS manages NOAA’s operational geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellite programs. NOAA/NESDIS’ objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life.  Further information regarding the requirements of this program can be found at the following web site: http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov.

NESDIS is seeking an organization to provide independent and objective support over the next five years in architecture planning development, acquisition support, systems development, operations support, and assessments of technology opportunities and alternatives for future and current satellite programs as well as domestic and foreign commercial satellite technology and policy implementation.  Because of the nature of these services, they are needed from an organization who will not experience significant organizational conflicts of interest from any analysis and recommendations in support of the agency mission. 

Currently, NOAA/NESDIS is acquiring these services as the result of a sole source acquisition with the MITRE Corporation pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c)(1) and has done so for the past eleven years. If based on the results of this sources sought and the evaluation of any capability statement(s) submitted in response to this synopsis, it is determined that there are no other qualified sources, this synopsis will serve as the notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with the MITRE Corporation and will meet the publication requirements of a proposed sole source award.  

In support of this NESDIS requirement, any resultant contract would have an estimated period of performance for the base contract of one year with four one-year options for a total of five years (inclusive of options). The two primary tasks under any resultant contract would be for support of the National Polar-orbiting and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Systems). The Government estimates the following 
level of effort per year: 4,081 senior professional, 15,360 
professional, and 1,068 technical and administrative for approximately 10 staff members per year (based on an estimated 1,920 productive person year).

The Contractor will be required to provide qualified management, personnel, organizational structure, procedural and administration functions to effectively and efficiently manage the work performed under any contract. Interested offerors having the specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 15 pages or less within forty-five days of the publication of this announcement. In addition to addressing organizational conflicts of interest, the capability statement should address the organization’s ability to support all aspects of the aforementioned technical capabilities, and specifically address the following:

Describe relevant organizational experiences in performance and management of Research and Development in the area of aeronautical and space systems engineering and in defining and developing current and next generation operational environmental satellite systems. Reference and provide detailed examples of work in the technical areas listed above.

Detail relevant organizational experiences for contracts with multiple tasks and/or projects and include average number of tasks/year managed.

Identify the credentials of key staff members, their contributions on other similar projects, and their availability to any resultant contract.

Detail relevant organizational experience with confidential and sensitive information and the avoidance of conflicts of interests (as noted above).

In addition to addressing technical capabilities, responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business (i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged business, woman owned, etc.); average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture 
partners, potential teaming partner’s, prime contractor (if potential subcontractor) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; point of contact - address and phone number), and list any existing Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACS) for which you are currently qualified.

Telephone responses are NOT solicited. No solicitation exists; 
therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), SSMC3 - Room 10100/OFA64, 1305 East West Highway, 10th Floor, Silver Spring, MD 20910 Attn: Marilyn B. Whaley, Contracting 
Officer. Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>H -- Body Armor Standards and Testing Technical Workshop
<DESC>This special notice is to publicize the upcoming Body Armor Standards and Testing Technical Workshop.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST), Office of Law Enforcement Standards (OLES), in conjunction with the U.S Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Office of Science and Technology (OS&T), is hosting a Body Armor Standards and Testing Technical Workshop on November 21- 22, 2005, at NIST in Gaithersburg, MD.  The purpose of the workshop is to solicit comment and technical input from industry (body armor manufacturers; ballistic materials manufacturers; and ballistic fiber manufacturers), public safety agencies and organizations, the scientific community, research and development organizations, and other stakeholders as NIST and NIJ revise the ballistic-resistance of personal body armor standard.  

Specifically, we seek to gather information concerning performance requirements and testing methodologies that public safety officials and industry representatives feel should be included in future revisions to NIJ body armor standard.  We invite public safety officials and  industry comment and/or suggested operational requirements and testing methodologies, along with justification (e.g. research findings, testing data, and professional experience) for them.  Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  validation of used armor performance; non-destructive testing/monitoring methods for used armor to ensure ongoing performance; improved requirements and testing protocols for new armor (e.g. blunt trauma, multi-shot impacts, contact shots,); numbers and sizes of samples to be tested; long-term performance of armor; artificial armor aging protocols to replicate field use; quality control and conformity assessments, third party testing, and loss of compliance.

The workshop is open to body armor industry technical representatives, official representatives from public safety agencies and organizations, the research and development and scientific communities, and other stakeholders.  Due to space limitations registration will be on a first-come first-served basis and limited to no more than two representatives per agency/organization.  We also encourage the submission of technical input and/or recommendations regarding future revisions to the body armor standard, along with their justification, prior to the workshop (please see related FBO special notice RFI-2006-001 posted on October 27, 2005; that RFI contains links to the standards to be discussed).  

Those individuals wishing to attend this workshop must register online at https://conference.aspensys.com/NIJNIST/index.html by November 16, 2005.  No registration fee is required for this event.  Directions to the facility and additional information can be found on the website.  Given the technical content being presented at this workshop, it is strongly recommended that only those individuals with scientific and technical knowledge and experience in the above areas register.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) released Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 06-04 on 25 October 2005 for the VisiBuilding Program. DARPA will hold a Proposers Day Briefing for the VisiBuilding BAA 06-04 on 14 November 2005 at the Booz Allen Hamilton – Newman Auditorium 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102. Doors will open at 0800, and presentations will begin at 0845. Potential proposers should visit the VisiBuilding Industry Day website https://www.schafertmd.com/VisibuildingIndustryDay/index.html for more information and to receive further instructions for attending. The conference schedule will be sent with confirmation emails. The meeting will be Unclassified. All attendees at the Proposers Day Briefing must be pre-approved and pre-registered before the meeting starts. The number of attendees per organization may be limited due to space considerations. The deadline for registration is November 10, 2005.  All questions regarding attendance should be emailed to VisiBuilding@darpa.mil. The goal of the VisiBuilding program is to develop knowledge-deriving architectures for sensing people and objects in buildings.  The program will address propagation and backscatter off urban structures, develop operational concepts for sensor position and utilization, and derive model-driven algorithms that best match hypothesized structural models with the actual sensed data.  A key component of VisiBuilding will be how to make the technology operationally useful to support all stand-off sense-through-buildings concepts of operations (CONOPS), ranging from pre-mission planning to find which buildings should be searched, through detailed assessment of targeted structures for building layouts and behavioral analysis, live updates of building occupancy to support building raids, and finally post-mission analysis to find hidden objects or people.  Sensor and exploitation architectures must provide:  1) a detailed understanding of the building structure to provide actionable information on building layouts, and provide reasonable floor plans of the structure, 2) detection and localization of anomalous quantities of materials within the building structure, and 3) detection and localization of people within a building.  In order to be effective, VisiBuilding must demonstrate penetration and interpretation through at least two exterior-grade walls using standard building construction materials such as reinforced concrete, concrete block, brick, adobe, etc.  Concrete and concrete block should be at least eight inches (20 cm) in thickness.  Sensor architectures must be able to resolve wall positions to within 0.5 meters laterally and ceiling and floor locations within 0.5 meters vertically, with a 95 percent probability of correct localization.  Similarly, they must be able to detect and localize non-structure related materials larger than 3 square meters in size beyond two walls.  They must also be able to detect, resolve, and locate moving personnel within 0.5 meters with a 99 percent probability of detection and 1 percent false alarm rate with a minimum detectable velocity of 0.5 meters/second.  Sensor architectures should permit close-range stand-off from the building to be examined. Stand-off distances should at least be 10 meters, or on the order of street-level access or from neighboring structures. Ideally, sensor configurations should allow for discrete (perhaps covert) examination of the building structure through some combination of any or all of the following: small distributed hand-held or emplaced sensors, vehicle-borne sensors, and/or airborne or perching sensors. Sensor architectures will be an important facet of this development, but the key technology advances are expected in the areas of phenomenology, sensor architectures, and exploitation and model-based reconstruction algorithms.  These three areas are tightly coupled, and the interdependencies between them should be represented in the proposals program and management plan. The program will be a multi-phase effort, with each phase constructed to advance the technology towards a full demonstration of capability.  Phase I will be a twelve-month Concept Development and Evaluation effort to develop conceptual ideas in one or more sensor modes and configurations.  The proposed architecture will be simulated and analyzed to show concept realism for penetrating deep within standard buildings. This will lead into a concept design review.  The result of this phase will be concept design(s) and the estimated performance for the Phase II Sensor Demonstration System(s), and an updated execution plan and cost for the Phase II prototype design, development, and demonstration effort. The following descriptions of Phase II and III activities are notional. Any and all aspects of these phases are subject to change pending the outcome of Phase I (and Phase II results for Phase III).  Selected performers may continue with Phase II, an eighteen month Sensor Demonstration System phase to develop the sensor and exploitation architecture and demonstrate its capability on two-story structures.  This phase will require developing a full sensor system and exploitation architecture meeting design objectives on selected building structures. Based upon the Phase II demonstration results and an updated form-fit prototype description, selected performers may continue Phase III for a fifteen month Advanced Prototype Development effort to develop a full prototype system that can sense and accurately model multi-story structures, including all necessary sensor communication and on-line processing. Work under the VisiBuilding Program will be unclassified.

The Economic Research Service (ERS), as the lead economic research arm of the Department, has responsibility to conduct economic research supporting the mission of the Department.  This responsibility includes conducting research and providing information to Department officials on economic issues related to food safety, nutrition and health (including factors related to food choices), consumption patterns at and away from home, food prices, food assistance programs, nutrition education, and food industry structure.  While some of this research can be accomplished using publicly available data, some issues may require collection of new data.      Departmental policy officials often manage and address the effects of unforeseen food and agricultural market developments such as large swings in sales volume, prices, or quantities purchased of major food products without the most up-to-date market information.  During high-profile events, such as BSE or sales declines of orange juice consumption, access to up-to-date data and information on consumers’ intentions and market transactions is particularly critical. Publicly available data on price and quantity of purchased and consumed foods are not available for households in consistent fashion, and the available data are not current.  The USDA’s disappearance data system provides annual consumption estimates for several hundred commodities.  Consumption is based on production data and dates back to 1909.  The data are used to analyze trends and shifts in food consumption, to calculate the nutrient content of the food supply, and to compare the composition of the food supply with dietary recommendations.  The data provide national averages only and the lag between data collection and release has averaged about two years. The U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics has conducted an annual Consumer Expenditures Survey since 1980.  This series provides information on the spending patterns of American households from a nationally representative sample of 5,000 households.  The survey provides a breakdown on spending for food at home but no information on quantities or prices.  The lag between data collection and release averages about a year. The yearly National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a joint USDA and Health and Human Services activity, collect dietary intake data on a nationally representative sample of 5,000 individuals.  The survey provides information on food intake by individuals, where food was purchased and eaten and, for sampled persons only, personal, economic, and demographic characteristics.  The data are used to examine who eats what in America, to compare intake with dietary guidelines, to analyze effects of individual characteristics on food consumption, and to link food intake with health outcomes.  The data does not include food prices and there is a 2-year lag between data collection and release. A primary objective of the research program is to understand food purchase and consumption patterns of consumers and how these change as people age, households change, new products are introduced, and new information is acquired; identify and develop consistent strategies for consumers in various demographic groups and regions to effectively adopt the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; better understand the market dynamics of food safety and other consumer health issues; and understand links between foods, physical activity and health outcomes; quickly survey consumers about new issues or developments. Another key objective of the program is to provide real-time information on consumer reactions to unforeseen events and disruptions, current market events, and government policies.  When markets are shocked, effective management of market impacts require a solid understanding of how consumer reactions would be linked to actual food purchases, sales, consumption, and price information. Finally, the program seeks to understand how individual attitudes and knowledge and healthful eating affect food choices, dietary status, and health outcomes. Consumer and Market Trends: Data needs consist of historical and most recent updates on prices, quantities sold, and total sales volume for various food products (see attached list) on a national, regional, and market (where available) basis across the U.S. for foods consumed either at or away from home. These data would be used to: Examine trends in the retail food market; Identify differences in food prices across markets in the U.S.; Measure the impact of food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment; Compare measures of food purchase behavior to measures of food purchase behavior in the Consumer Expenditure Survey; Determine the types of foods that U.S. households purchase by demographic segment with specific focus on low-income households and how they differ from other demographic groups; Identify the prices that households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased; Assess how low-income households differ in the food choices they make and the prices that they pay for food. In addition, historical and current purchase data are need at item level for food consumed either at or away from home that are based on a demographically and geographically representative sample of U.S. households.  These data will be used to implement research in such issues as: Investigating the impact of USDA's National Organic Program on product differentiation and household demand for differentiated milk products (organic, non-rBGH, and conventional); Identifying what price households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased; Identifying differences in food prices across markets in the U.S. and analyze the impact the increasing number of alternative retail outlets for food on food prices and accessibility; Investigating the effect of different tastes and preferences across households on food demand; and Measure the impact of consumer food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment. These issues require transaction-level information that would cover food purchases by each household for all restaurants and all food store outlets available to a household and identify the store and restaurants from which each item or meal is purchased.  In addition, all available descriptions such as ‘organic’, ‘non-RBST’, ‘genetically-engineered’, ‘GE’, ‘non-GE’, and/or ‘non-RBGH’ should be clearly identified.  Research would depend on (1) full knowledge of sampling and expenditure weights in order to aggregate measures both nationally and per local market for individual food products and aggregated food groups, and (2) a complete description of sample design. In addition to sample weights and design, other relevant data (such as strata and clusters) drive the research.  A data description dictionary that provides a full explanation of any abbreviated terms in the data and a listing of all the available common characteristics are particularly important.  All information on household demographics and l outlet details are significant components of successful research implementation.  For food-away-from-home issues, recipes (when available) are critical. Food Consumption Special Reports:  Historical and current data and analytical intelligence on consumption (rather than purchase) of foods at and away from home are needed to examine how consumer attitudes and market trend and fads affect consumers diet and health.  For this purpose, consumption data for members of a demographically and regionally representative sample of US household along with rich demographic, including dietary and attitudinal, information is needed.  Special Requests for Consumer and Market Information: Responding to requests for specific product, brand, or outlet information or anticipating key issues relating to specific foods, customized analyses will be require to examine in detail at a specific product or sub-group of food items for foods consumed either at or away from home.  For example, a report may contain detailed information on the retail trends in orange juice sales or report changes in the type and frequency of beef sales by region by various household (or individual), or restaurant characteristics. In addition, ERS would seek ad-hoc, drill-down analyses on the impacts of specific policy concerns or unexpected events on specific foods or meals, market conditions, demographic groups, or any combination of the above-mentioned items.  For example, the influence of low-carb diets on sales of bakery products, restaurant foods, and new product and meal introductions at retail stores and restaurants.  Non-proprietary or syndicated analyses or publications on issues of interest could also be considered. Special requests can quickly provide analytical information on high-profile issues, particularly as they relate to consumers’ attitude and health and knowledge information.  Special requests often call for collecting primary data from panel members on their perceptions, intentions, and attitudes with respect to unforeseen disruption or high-profile market events.  Such information is needed to examine how consumer intentions would impact the market, or match consumers’ actual purchases in the market place.  Non-proprietary or syndicated analyses or publications on these issues would also be of interest. List of aggregate Categories: cereals products, flour and prepared flour mixes, breakfast cereal, rice, pasta, cornmeal; bakery products, bread, fresh biscuits, rolls, muffins, cakes, cupcakes, and cookies, other bakery products;      beef and veal, uncooked ground beef, uncooked other beef, pork, processed fresh, other pork, other meats; poultry, chicken, other poultry including turkey; fish and seafood, fresh fish and seafood, processed fish and seafood; eggs; fairy and related products, milk, cheese and related products, ice cream and related products, other dairy and related products; fruits and vegetables, fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh fruits, apples, bananas, citrus fruits, other fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes, other fresh vegetables, processed fruits and vegetables, canned fruits and vegetables, frozen fruits and vegetables, other processed fruits and vegetables including  dried nonalcoholic beverages and beverage materials, juices and nonalcoholic drinks, carbonated drinks, frozen noncarbonated juices and drinks, non-frozen noncarbonated juices and drinks; beverage materials including coffee and tea, coffee, other beverage materials including tea, sugar and sweets, fats and oils, butter and margarine salad dressing, other fats and oils including peanut butter, soups, frozen and freeze dried prepared foods, snacks, spices, seasonings, condiments, sauces baby food, all other miscellaneous foods

<DESC>This Modification to the combined synopsis/solicitation NBCW6Z00218 is issued in response to several inquiries made by interested/potential offerors of this Solicitation It is of critical importance that any interested offeror is aware of the following: 1) In order to receive a contract award from the US Department of the Interior, a contractor must be registered with CCR ("Central Contractor Registration").

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. ONE TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR NDE ULTRASONICS LAB EQUIPMENT - X AXIS SCANNING SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide a list of the questions received and the answers to the questions, as follows: Question 1: Do you have additional and/or sketches on the requirement for the X-Axis Scanning System? Answer 1:  There is no additional information available for this requirement.  There are no sketches available. Question 2: Do you just need the X-Axis to be compatible with the R/D Tech Focus interface cable?  The solicitation asks to quote a motor controller, but does not ask for a Data Acquisition package.  Do you require a Data Acquisition package to be included in this quote or is it the intent to use an existing R/D Tech system? Answer 2: We just need an encoder feedback on the tank motors so that the RD Tech data acquisition system can read it.  We do need a separate motor control system.  The RD Tech provides the passive data acquisition. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on October 20, 2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
