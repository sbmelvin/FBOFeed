Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has provided all three branches of the federal government with a set of centralized services that enables them to efficiently and cost effectively produce both printed and electronic documents. GPO has offered these publications for sale to the public and made them widely available for no fee public access through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The FDLP has served the purpose of providing permanent public access to government publications. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">This requirement supports GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys) program. FDsys is a COTS-based enterprise content management system, with integration customizations to fully meet its requirements. The major COTS products that have been selected for FDsys include EMC's Documentum and an Enterprise Search tool from FAST Search and Transfer (FAST ESP) which are the foundational piece of the content repository. In addition, there are other tools and technologies that are being used to support FDsys. This includes, but is not limited to the use of JAVA for development, Caliber RM for requirements management, the use of Oracle Databases, the use of Mercury for testing, the use of RoboHelp for training, and a host of other COTS tools.</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">GPO intends to award a contract in support of FDsys for the ongoing design, development and enhancement of the search experience, specific to Microsoft/FAST (FAST ESP's) enterprise search tool, for GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys).

IAW FAR 5.207(c)(15)(i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which will be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.  
Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-8253.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, on behalf of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), announces its intent to publish, before the end of 2009, a solicitation for Tissue Source Sites for collection of normal human tissues. This solicitation will be issued as part of the NCI cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) initiative in support of the National Institutes of Health's Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Contracted Tissue Source Sites will be expected to collect multiple tissues from the same individual (autopsy and/or surgery) and to enroll at least 50 donors over an 18-month period. In addition, proposals should include a small qualitative study of the consent process and impact of the GTEx project on donors and families.<br /><br />caHUB is a new initiative being developed by the NCI Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research. Through an advanced network of tissue acquisition, biorepository operations, pathology review, and bioinformatics capabilities, caHUB will develop the high quality, clinically annotated biospecimens that are essential resources to accelerate the development of molecular-based diagnostics and therapeutics for personalized medicine. Additional information about caHUB may be found at http://www.cancer.gov/recoveryfunding/page10.<br /><br />Normal human tissues are essential to the study of cancer and other diseases. The GTEx project, a NIH Roadmap initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. caHUB will acquire normal tissues for the GTEx project through contracts with rapid autopsy programs and medical examiner programs, as well as plastic and transplant surgery programs.<br />

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541711   EPA is investigating the fate and transport of engineered nanomaterials (ENM) in air. The EPA seeks to develop a model to predict how ENM will behave in the atmosphere, in order to assess fate and transport. The model will be used to estimate the spatial distribution ofENM near their source as well as the size distribution of the ENM after it has interacted with a typical ambient aerosol. Two parameters which are critical to predicting the atmospheric fate of nanoparticles are (1) the deposition velocity (vd) and (2) the coagulation or agglomeration efficiency (K12). For ENMs smaller than ~ 50 nm diameter, the deposition velocity is expected to be dominated by Brownian diffusion. Both vd and K12 have been both modeled and measured for spherical particles (Figures 19.3 and 12.5, Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). Current nano-research initiatives within the Agency are focused on three separate ENMs:  CeO2, nanosilver, and nano-TiO2.
EPA?s research will include determination of the fate and transport of engineered nano-CeO2 which is currently used in Europe in diesel fuel additives in order to reduce soot emissions. Combusted nano-CeO-2 particles are expected to be released into the atmosphere attached to larger diesel soot particles (Jung et al., 2005). In this regard, the working hypothesis is that nanoparticles created with the cerium additive will have different characteristics than those generated without the additive.  The EPA thus seeks to measure the deposition velocity and coagulation efficiency for soot particles generated from the combustion of CeO2-doped and undoped diesel fuel.
Period of performance will be 12 months from award of the purchase order.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) with complete information will be posted on the EPA's website in approximately 15 days at the following address:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/   Responses to the RFQ will be due approximately 30 days after issuance of the RFQ.  Hard copies of the RFQ will not be available.  Offerors must submit both a technical proposal and a price proposal.  The price proposal must show a complete breakout of costs.  The technical proposal must include responses to the Technical Evaluation Criteria, which will be posted with the RFQ.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments (if any), will also be distributed solely through the EPA's web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Telephone and FAX requests for this information will not be honored.  Potential offerors should hold any technical questions until they have had a chance to completely review the RFQ.

<DESC>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide:
<p>An X-Ray tomography unit for imaging the interior structure of large diameter geologic drill cores. The tomography unit should be able to accommodate core samples of at least 10 cm diameter and core length of at least 30 cm. The tomography unit must be a fully integrated package consisting of at least an X-ray generator, focusing mechanism, sample translation capability, detector and data acquisition, analysis, and visualization software. The system must come with a shielded enclosure.</p>
<p>Ideally the integrated system should provide spatial resolution on the order of 100 microns on a 10 cm diameter core and while also providing maximum dynamic range, at a minimum of 16 bit. The data acquisition software should be able to accommodate multiple detector types including linear array and image plate. Acquisition times should not exceed 24 hrs for a single core 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>Types of geologic cores will vary from semi-consolidated sedimentary rocks with basalt, granite, and arkosic siltstone pebbles and cobbles in a matrix of sand, silt and clay to intact basalt rock. Analysis of the pore structure connectivity is of primary importance. Additional integrated instrumentation to enhance or highlight the pore structure will be viewed favorably.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Battelle does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The 6 CONS/LGCA at MacDill Air Force Base (Tampa), FL is seeking to identify sources that can provide 3 Hematology Analyzers and related materials based on the requirements below.
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE FOR SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE IS NO BID PACKAGE, SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROCUREMENT COMMITMENT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. RESPONSE IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY; NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR OR SUFFER ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY IMPROPERLY IDENTIFIED INFORMATION.</p>
<p>For purposes of this RFI, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes is 334516. The size standard is 500 employees. The place of performance for this requirement will be at the 6th Medical Group, MacDill AFB. The contractor shall provide all labor, tools and materials necessary to lease three (3) Hematology Analyzers (must also include reagents, training and actual test). We are looking for a base year plus four option years.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR<br />Sysmex Hematology Analyzer</p>
<p><br />SECTION TITLE <br />1.1 SCOPE OF WORK<br />1.2 POINT OF CONTACT<br />1.3 ORIENTATION<br />1.4 SPECIFIC TASKS<br />1.5 EDUCATION AND TRAINING REQUIRMENTS<br />1.6 EQUIPMENT ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT<br />1.7 ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT</p>
<p>GENERAL</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE OF WORK. This contract will continue to provide the laboratory with three Sysmex hematology analyzers and reagents needed for the laboratory to provide support to health care providers and subsequently the patients that receive medical care at the 6th Medical Group and Brandon Community Clinic. This contract also provides for training and a service contract which includes scheduled preventive maintenance, telephonic technical support as well as in-house service if needed. The Sysmex instruments are currently the 6th Medical Group's only source of providing hematology support for patient care. It is thoroughly integrated with the Medical Group's information system (IS) which includes all normal ranges, reference intervals and units of measurement. Sysmex service engineers perform calibrations twice per year with minimal down time to patient care. Sysmex unique advantages over other hematology systems include: advanced fluorescent (flow) technology for White Blood Cells (WBC), Reticulocytes, Platelets, Nucleated Red Blood Cells (NRBC), immature granulocytes, and FDA approved for body fluid cell counts. This same fluorescent technology, controls, and reagents are used across the entire Sysmex hematology platforms allowing for 100% standardization regardless of instrument model. Platelet counts are performed by two on-board methods (impedence and fluorescent optical) resulting in a more reliable count. The Sysmex instruments generate less hazardous waste (i.e., no cyanide, formaldehyde, or azide), during operation. To integrate a different hematology analyzer into the system would require retraining of all personnel, timely integration into the IS, and could create work-stoppage situations all which will have a tremendous negative impact on the continuity of patient care in the 6th Medical Group and Brandon Community Clinic. The Sysmex hematology analyzers have been very dependable and have produced quality results that have directly contributed to the mission of the 6th Medical Group. The contract period is from 1 Feb 2010 to 30 Sept 10 with (4) option years.<br /><br />1.2 POINT OF CONTACT. A point of contact and liaison has been provided for the Laboratory staff at the 6th Medical Group.</p>
<p>1.3 ORIENTATION. The training required to operate this instrumentation has already been accomplished. <br /><br />1.4 SPECIFIC TASKS. The instruments are used to analyze the following tests: WBC, Red Blood Cell Count (RBC), Hemoglobin (HGB), Hematocrit (HCT), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW), Platelet Count, Mean Platelet Volume (MPV), Neutrophil %, Lymphocyte %, Monocyte %, Eosinophil %, Basophil %, Neutrophil #, Lymphocyte #, Monocyte #, Eosinophil #, Basophil #, and reticulocyte % . These analytes aid the health care providers in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease.</p>
<p>1.5 EDUCATION AND TRAINING REQUIRMENTS. The staff is already familiar with the Sysmex instrumentation therefore no new training will be needed.</p>
<p>1.6 EQUIPMENT. The reagents are part of the contract that provides the analyzer at "No Cost" to the 6th Medical Group laboratory.</p>
<p>1.7 ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. Administrative support not required but technical support is available per the maintenance portion of the agreement.</p>
<p>*Firms responding to this RFI are asked to provide the following information in their initial response: company's full name, business size to include small business size categories, i.e., 8(a), Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Business, HUBZone, etc., GSA Schedule or Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) number (if applicable), CAGE Code, DUNS number, address, point of contact, and a clear indication as to whether or not they can provide the service the government is seeking. Final responses to this RFI will be due at 12:00 PM EST 23 November 09. Responses will be reviewed and may result in further clarifications to further explore commercial capabilities with selected respondents. As industry may expect to see portions of submitted information in future solicitations, portions of the response containing proprietary information should be clearly marked as such. Information submitted will not be returned to the respective respondents. Oral submissions of information are not acceptable and will not be accepted in response to this notice. The POC for this RFI is SrA Melissa Robertson, Contracting Specialist, Phone: (813) 828-1187; Fax: (813) 828-3667. Submit all responses via e-mail to melissa.robertson@macdill.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Emergency Training Center (NETC) is contemplating award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract to a highly qualified HubZone small business concern or, in the event two or more HubZone small businesses do not express an interest, a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). In accordance with FAR Part 19, there must be a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible HubZone firms, or SDVOSB firms, will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price.
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to determine the interest and capability of potentially qualified HubZone or SDVOSB firms registered in the Central Contractor Registration database under the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 541430, Graphic Design Services. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice the NETC Contracting Officer will determine if this requirement will be set-aside for Small Business Administration (SBA) Certified HubZone Small Business Concerns in accordance with the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-Part 19.1305 or, if the requirements of FAR 19.1305 cannot be met, the requirement will be offered to eligible Service Disabled Veteran owned small businesses (SDVSOB) in accordance with the requirements of FAR 19.1405. In the event that neither the requirements of FAR 19.1305 nor those of FAR 19.1405 are met, the requirement may be procured using another procurement method authorized under the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p>The primary services to be performed are on-site or off-site functional resources to provide the NETC Media Productions Center, graphic design services.. The contractor must demonstrate a strong operating knowledge of personal computer (PC) based design and peripherals, to include color lasers printers, color plotters, scanners, digital and video cameras, laminators, Web page design, video/audio editing, mechanical layout, typography, quality control and display/exhibit art production. The contractor must also be proficient with current software packages including Adobe CS4 (In Design, Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat, After Effects, Premiere Pro and Flash) and digital video editing software, as well as Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access), HTML, and multimedia development programs. In addition to the required knowledge/proficiency stated above, the contractor will be required to perform the following work: Create color brochures, exhibits, web pages, animated video clips, event photography, 3D models and other informational, instructional and marketing products. They will be required to make selections of photographs, art elements or other visual materials to be used in designing printed items and display art. Design work includes such factors as overall dimensions, including reduction and enlargement, color, typography and developing theme related items.</p>
<p>The contractor will also be responsible for developing ideas for the proposed concepts and use good judgment and visual effects in presenting the information. Effective use of media is necessary to have a dramatic impact on overall design to achieve the highest degree of visual effect. The contractor will be required to use the most effective visual mediums and provide advice and assistance to NETC customers on specific layouts or displays and maintain and gather resources to support presentations and other graphics requirements. The contractor must demonstrate a strong knowledge of the graphics and Media industry, e.g., its structure, practices, and major manufacturers.</p>
<p>The work may be performed at the NETC, located in Emmitsburg, Maryland, Frederick County, or at the contractor's location, provided all delivery schedules can be met including short turn around requirements. Workstations and most production equipment will be provided on-site if the work is performed at the NETC. If work is performed at the contractor's location, no government furnished equipment/property will be provided. The contractor will provide workstations/equipment for work performed at the contractor's location. The NETC is located in Census Tract "24021753200" which IS NOT HubZone qualified. Our intent, subject to change, is to issue a single contract containing a base period with 4 option periods. The government reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to decline to exercise option periods.</p>

<RESPDATE>092509
<CONTACT>Patricia R. Singer, Phone (915) 832-4709, Fax (915) 832-4192, Email pssinger@ibwc.gov
<DESC><p><br />
<p>1. Purpose.</p>
<p>A. The purpose for the Statement of Work is to establish a description of the necessary contractual services for the conduct of an independent comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) in executing its programs, based on the agency's legislative authorities provided under 22 USC 277 and treaty mandates. The assessment is to evaluate the agency's effectiveness in achieving its overall mission and strategic goals, as well as develop recommendations for operational improvements. A component of the assessment will be an evaluation of the USIBWC organizational structure and right-sizing.</p>
<p>B. The assessment shall provide the United States Commissioner (Commissioner"), as the agency head, the following:</p>
<p>(1) An in-depth, unbiased, independent evaluation of the agency's performance in order to improve operational effectiveness and long-range strategic planning.</p>
<p>(2) A clear understanding of the agency's management and organization structure, functions, programs, and activities, along with identification of specific areas for improvement and/or restructuring.</p>
<p>(3) Identify areas for program and organizational improvements based on research of treaty and regulatory requirements, generally accepted management and professional practices and standards, and best practices in the federal government.</p>
<p>(4) Recommend the most efficient and effective organizational structure and staffing and oversight mechanisms, focusing on accountability and performance-based outcomes.</p>
<p><br />2. Background</p>
<p>A. The assessment is an FY 2006 program improvement plan pending action in response to The Government Reorganization and Program Performance Improvement Act of 2005, the President's Management Agenda (PMS), and the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) which requires federal agencies to assess their programs and demonstrate program performance or improved performance, and report to the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p><br />B. An assessment also is needed due to the following developments: numerous reorganizations of the USIBWC headquarters have taken place in the past ten years by a succession of permanent and acting agency heads and without the benefit of consistently methodical approaches; the agency is experiencing new mission requirements; and the agency is declining significantly in overall indicators of human capital performance.</p>
<p><br />3. General Requirements</p>
<p>A. The contractor shall carry out program analysis services as part of the comprehensive assessment, which will culminate in a final report providing recommendations that are documented by supporting evidence.</p>
<p>B. The contractor shall provide a staff possessing advanced training and experience in conducting and reporting on in-depth organizational assessments of small federal agencies, taking into account that the United States Section is the U.S. component of a bilateral organization charged with applying U.S.-Mexico boundary and water treaties.</p>
<p>C. The contractor shall carry out the following specific tasks:</p>
<p>(1) Task Order Management. The contractor will track progress toward completion of the comprehensive assessment through bi-weekly progress reports detailing the status of current activities and detailed descriptions of projected activities. The contractor will submit the progress reports via e-mail to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) not later than 3:00 p.m. on the first and third Thursday of each month.</p>
<p>(2) Study Planning. The purpose for this task is to develop a detailed and comprehensive plan for conducting the assessment. The plan is to define the scope of the assessment and the key milestones that must be achieved for project success. The contractor will work closely with management officials designated by the Commissioner to define required outcomes of the assessment that will clearly delineate its successful completion, ensuring that key stakeholder questions and answers are addressed during the planning effort and that deliverables provide the desired information. The contractor shall provide a kickoff briefing in order to walk the Commissioner, executive staff, and other invited management officials through the assessment process. At a minimum, the briefing will address the scope and projected results of the assessment, highlight responsibilities for conducting and completing the assessment, list the key events and deliverables, and provide required organizational interfaces. Subsequently, within two calendar weeks of the kickoff briefing, the contractor will develop and submit to the CO and COTR for approval a plan of action and milestones (POAM) for the assessment.</p>
<p>(3) Briefings. In addition to the kickoff briefing, the contractor will conduct other briefings throughout the assessment as needed or as requested by the CO or COTR.</p>
<p>(4) Assessment Execution.</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall carry out the assessment based on the work plan drafted by the contractor and approved by the Commissioner. Although the contractor shall perform all necessary assessment activities, execution of the assessment is to include, at a minimum, the following activities:</p>
<p>(i) studying the mission, functions, and effectiveness of the agency and each work unit separately, in relation to other work units, and within the organization's overall context;</p>
<p>(ii) analyzing the current organization structure and management practices in conjunction with studying the management practices and organization structure and staffing of other small federal agencies to determine best practices that can be applied to the USIBWC;</p>
<p>(iii) studying federal statutes, regulations, executive orders, standards, and other formal guidelines requiring or recommending the establishment of programs and activities of small federal agencies;</p>

The HARS is being remediated with uncontaminated, Category I dredged material by placement of at least a 1-meter thick sediment cap.  A Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) developed for the HARS, encompasses, through tiered selection criteria, precision bathymetric surveying, side-scan sonar analysis, sub-bottom seismic profiling, surface and subsurface sediment collection and analysis (photography, benthic community structure analysis, grain size, chemical characteristics and toxicity, bio-assays and bio-accumulation studies), water quality analysis, oceanographic and sedimentological process studies.  The SMMP is being used as a guideline to manage placement of dredged material at the HARS, to ensure efficient construction of the 1-meter sediment cap, and to monitor changes at the HARS while remediation activities occur and, ultimately, to ensure remediation has been completed.  The USACE New York District (CENAN) is responsible for contracting and overseeing the various activities described in the SMMP.  A revised HARS SMMP will be available in 2010.  Alternative locations for ocean placement of dredged materials may be necessary after HARS remediation is completed and it may be necessary to investigate alternatives during the final years of HARS remediation.<BR>This future contract will be used to complete the activities described in the HARS SMMP and related activities in a timely, technically sound, and cost effective manner.  Additionally, this contract will allow data collection associated with investigation of future sites for ocean placement of dredged materials.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Contracts Management Office (CMO), on behalf of the Strategic Technology Office (STO), intends to award an approximately 24-month sole source follow-on Phase 3 contract to Textron Defense Systems (TDS), of Wilmington, MA, for continuation of their High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) research program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The goal of the HELLADS program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system (150 kW) with an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems.&nbsp; With a weight goal of &lt;5 kg/kW, HELLADS will enable high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems.&nbsp; The compact footprint required of the HELLADS laser enables integration on tactical platforms while also maintaining the capability of those platforms to conduct traditional missions. HELLADS requires a laser that is compatible with a laser weapon system weight of 750 kg for a 150 kW DLWS laser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At completion of their current Phase 2 HELLADS effort (Agreement No. HR0011-08-9-0006), TDS will have designed, fabricated, and tested their candidate full-scale unit cell laser module (to include associated subsystems and support components/equipment), as well as designed the full 150 kW Laser for the HELLADS Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This unit cell demonstration will validate the ability to produce output power and beam quality required to meet the full scale 150kW performance within the weight and volume goals through integration of replicated unit cells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If invited, in Phase 3 TDS will fabricate their 150 kW laser, verify its performance, and integrate it into the Government DLWS for system testing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As developer of a HELLADS system based on their proprietary Thin-Zag concept, TDS possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and proprietary intellectual property/data required to carry out the subject HELLADS DLWS research effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals and a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>solicitation is not currently available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses/proposals received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than 30 December 2009 to <a href="mailto:DARPA-SN-10-03@darpa.mil">DARPA-SN-10-03@darpa.mil</a>.

<SUBJECT>Limits of Thermodynamic Storage (LOTS) of Energy; Proposer's Day Workshop
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-10-07
<RESPDATE>112709
<ARCHDATE>12152009
<CONTACT>Brian Holloway, Dr., Email DARPA-SN-10-07@darpa.mil
<DESC><p>In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of Limits Of Thermodynamic Storage (LOTS) of Energy, DARPA is hosting a Proposers' Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of interdisciplinary teams to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DOD) is critically dependent on portable electronics and, by extension, portable energy sources such as batteries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the actual energy output of state-of-the-art (SOA) battery technologies, such as the BA5590 LiSO<sub>2</sub> primary and BB2590 Li-ion secondary systems, fall short of their projected energy capacity under load, limiting run time of DOD electronic systems to as little as 20% of theoretical capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This operational inefficiency increases the number of batteries soldiers must carry in the field and also limits implementation of hybridization and distributed power concepts for DOD ground, aerial, and maritime vehicle platforms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>DARPA seeks to maximize the utilization of portable energy sources (batteries, fuel cells, etc.) up to their theoretical limit under real load power profiles which include significant transient discharging and/or charging power spikes. If successful the DARPA LOTS of Energy program would address these inefficiencies in energy extraction by developing technologies that are capable of delivering the full expected run time out of a SOA portable energy source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="COLOR: black">Concepts relevant to the objectives of the LOTS of Energy program can be found in numerous disciplines and areas of research including <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">electrodes, electrolytes, separators,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>packaging and manufacturing, electrochemical double layer capacitors, asymmetric electrochemical capacitors, Li-Ion batteries, Metal-Air batteries, other batteries, power management circuits, charge indication technology <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></em>and others.</span></p>
<p>To facilitate maximum participation DARPA will host a LOTS of Energy Proposers' Day Workshop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The workshop will: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the LOTS of Energy program vision and objectives;</p>
<p>(b) explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this potential effort; and (c) promote teaming arrangements among organizations having relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to execute an interdisciplinary research program responsive to the LOTS of Energy program goals. The workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas is critical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate discussions during the poster session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, a teaming website has been established to facilitate these interactions at <a href="http://www.sainc.com/LOTSTeaming">http://www.sainc.com/LOTSTeaming</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no fee to attend the LOTS of Energy Proposers' Day Workshop. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Registration for the workshop is limited by the venue capacity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To maximize the number of organizations participating, there is a limit of two persons per organization. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Early registration is strongly recommended. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The poster session will be limited to 1 poster per organization with a cut-off of 100 posters total.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If during the term of the contract, the TFS's exceed the NTE amount, the contractor may submit a request for equitable adjustment (REA). The REA must document what TFS(s) changed to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued to establish a new NTE amount based upon the newly documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation.<br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] <br />[ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. <br />[ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

By submission of its offer, the offeror represents that it is not an inverted domestic corporation and is not a subsidiary of one.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br />The solicitation number is 1219021 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ.) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36. <br />The Office of Science Policy and Communications, Science Policy Branch (OSP), at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a requirement for Program Evaluation Support Services to assist with the Phase II - Process Evaluation of the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Program. This Roadmap program is being administered by NIDA, the National Institute of Diabetes And Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).<br />The NIH Roadmap is a series of programs designed to foster new ways of doing research, to fill fundamental knowledge gaps, and to encourage risk taking to solve complex problems. The Epigenomics Program (EP) has five related components - Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers; an Epigenomics Data Analysis and Coordination Center; a research component for Technology Development in Epigenetics; a research component for Discovery of Novel Epigenetic Marks in Mammalian Cells; and a research component for Epigenomics of Human Health and Disease.<br />The purpose of this evaluation requirement is to provide comprehensive support to the OSP/ NIDA Project Officer (PO), and the supporting Evaluation Leads (ELs) of the program from the co-administrating Institutes, for the evaluation activities of this Phase II-Process Evaluation, from a position of knowledge of program evaluation and evaluative research, knowledge of the application of program evaluation to complex funded research programs, and of graduate level knowledge of Epigenetics and Bioinformatics. This support will be for the conduct of the tasks of information collection for the evaluation, such as program documents inventorying to collect information on aspects of program process to show improvements in the program, and information on program achievement; data and information preparation, processing, and management; analyses of the information; writing/editing reports and document production; assistance in the preparation of a Supporting Statement for OMB clearance; survey administration, and information download; data searches of public databases; and to provide recommendations for the Phase III - Goal-oriented outcome evaluation to be conducted at the end of the first term of the program. The planning and conduct to date of the evaluation study for this program has been assisted primarily by one of two external Academic Advisors/Consultants who were named to the study, and who will continue to review the work and provide some oversight and recommendations to the NIH staff during the first year of this Phase II-Process Evaluation study. The Contractor can expect that some of the plans and deliverables will be reviewed by the current Academic Advisor. The Contractor offering for this present request will not be excluded as an offeror for the Phase III study. <br />The Contractor will have an understanding of NIH policies and procedures, the ability to apply methods of evaluation to the requirements of this multiple-components program and the different stages the components are in, demonstrated ability to meet fast turn around deadlines, and graduate level knowledge of Epigenetics by at least one principal staff assigned to the project. The Contractor must also provide the services of a Consultant Advisor/Academic Advisor to the Evaluation (CA/AA) with an academic background in evaluation for the broad disciplinary knowledge and application experience in evaluating funded research programs that would provide this study with advice, guidance, and recommendations for the different evaluation tasks. The CA/AA can be a staff person or a sub-contractor to the study.
<p>Task 1 - Information Collection from Program Documents, and Reported Information - <br />Contractor must demonstrate the ability to review scientific reporting documents from the program, to develop information collection protocols and/or systems and for extracting information, to conduct information collection, to synthesize the scientific and bioinformatics information of relevance to describe the background information of the program, to describe the program processes and achievements, and to organize the information into formats for analysis. <br />Contractor must demonstrate the ability to search publications databases and collect information from these databases as it relates to the progress of the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Program, and to verify that the information is correct and is not duplicative. <br />Contractor must also have knowledge of the theoretical requirements in using survey information from small purposive sample surveys and of analytic methods for interpreting the information. Contractor will require knowledge in epigenetics, epigenomics, bioinformatics, population genetics, and of current epigenomics literature. Contractor must be knowledgeable of the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Program, its objectives, funding mechanisms, and components. Contractor must have knowledge of the policies and legal requirements of the NIH regarding protected information in its databases. Contractor must have general knowledge of the biology of human diseases as it relates to epigenomics.</p>
<p>The contractor will review program documents provided by the PO, as well as by the supporting ELs. The contractor will develop information collection protocols to collect the information from secondary sources. <br />The contractor will review the documents and extract information of greatest relevance to, for example, show the progress and achievement of the components of the program, to describe the program background, to describe aspects of program conduct that may be revealing or may provide lessons to be learned. The volume of documents will be determined by the on-going program, may vary from time to time, and could include documents such as synthesized progress reports, meeting notes, meeting minutes from technical workshops. Relevance will be guided by the evaluation questions that have been developed by the NIH staff, for each program component and for the program as a whole. The evaluation questions are based on the objectives specified in the RFAs, they include complex and simple questions. The frequency of inventorying will be negotiated. The contractor may need to search publications data bases (one to two data bases may be selected by the PO and ELs /NIH program and evaluation staff), and document publications attributable to the Epigenomics program. The frequency of searches is to be negotiated.</p>
<p><br />Task 2 - Information Collection from Primary Sources - <br />Contractor must have knowledge and expertise in methods of questionnaire development, survey administration, ability to address theoretical requirements of survey data and information collection and analysis of the information; professional/technical ability in uploading and administering e-surveys; preparation, processing, and managing of survey results; successful experience in preparation of a Supporting Statement for OMB clearance. <br />The contractor will provide assistance in the development and pre-test of the instruments as needed. There will be one survey of the Principal Investigators (PIs) funded in the program, which will need OMB clearance. There will be three information collection protocols, for a set of nine or fewer users of the data interface developed by the program. <br />The contractor will upload and administer the instruments which may be either by survey software or email; will administer reminders to non-responders to the PIs survey for maximum completeness; will manage download and preparation of respondent information for analysis. <br />The contractor will provide assistance in analyzing the data, providing suggestions for the best ways to demonstrate program achievement.<br />The contractor will provide assistance to the PO as needed in preparing the OMB Supporting Statement package.</p>

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.  
     (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE    (ii)  PRICE
(b)  Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
(c)  By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  
(d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(f)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 
Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 
FAX:  202.475.3904. 
The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. <br />(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

By submission of its offer, the offeror represents that it is not an inverted domestic corporation and is not a subsidiary of one.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The DCHA/OTI Program Office provides OTI with strategic guidance on country-level and office-level budgeting, strategy, and program performance issues, and increases key stakeholder awareness of and support for OTI as a key instrument in carrying out U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Program Office maintains technical oversight of the Support Which Implements Fast Transitions (SWIFT) II IQC and the Programming Development Quickly (PDQ) IQC, and manages coordination of programming within the Foreign Assistance (F) framework. The Program Office plays a key role in the initial country assessment process, periodic country program and management reviews, and final evaluations. The Program Office also provides support to ongoing country programs through managing country budgeting decisions and allocation of resources, and setting standards and providing guidance on strategic planning, decision-making, and implementation. In addition, the Program Office provides reports on country activities for DCHA, OMB, Department of State, and Congress.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manger for Evaluation and Performance Reporting will be part of the OTI Program Office and will work with OTI country teams in capturing the program performance data, documenting and disseminating monitoring and evaluation systems and processes, and carrying out regular and final evaluations of OTI country programs. The incumbent must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent writing and communication skills and a developed understanding of U.S. foreign policy interests and the role transition programming can play in the mitigation of conflict and the development of democracy. Ideally, the Program Manger will have experience working on political and democratic transitions, peace and security programming, democracy building, or post-conflict programs that are similar to those that OTI implements. The Program Manger will also have experience in at least one of the following areas - program assessment, design, monitoring, and/or evaluation of activities and programs - as implemented in the transitional environments in which OTI works.</p>
<p>The successful candidate must be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice. Since work often involves frequent coordination with highly dynamic country programs, the individual must be someone who is highly-flexible and able to work on multiple tasks simultaneously, often with quick turn-around times. S/he must be able to work effectively and productively as a member of a team. Specifically, the Program Manager will work with OTI country programs to capture country project and program level implementation information. This information will directly contribute to the country team's program analysis and reporting. The captured information will also help better define implementation of program activities.</p>
<p>This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus the vast majority of time on country program implementation. The objectives for this position are to (1) improve OTI's capacity to evaluate program activities and to report on the achievements of the program through different performance measures, and (2) help improve OTI strategic planning for new and current country programs through better cross-fertilization of ideas and systems.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $100,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept. If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept. Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at &lsquo;http://www.dodsbir.net/submission' following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying. Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.

The conference will be held at the GSA Regional Office Building, 20 N. 8th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107.<br /></strong><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of Phase I has concluded. Contractors must have submitted a timely Phase I Technical Proposal in order to be considered for Phase II. Any contractor that did not submit a timely technical proposal for Phase I will not be considered for Phase II evaluation, nor considered for award.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for a firm to provide all labor, material, equipment, and supervision necessary for construction services for the Recovery U.S. Custom House Envelope Renovation Project. The project for this building includes roof replacement, repair/replacement of windows, masonry restoration, replacement of the tower lighting with energy efficient fixtures, installation of a new high-efficiency boiler and installation of a lightening protection system. The U.S. Custom House is located at 200 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is eligible for listing as a National Historic Landmark (NHL).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The method of procurement for this requirement will be Full &amp; Open Competition with no restrictions. The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220. Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. For this requirement, technical factors (non-price factors) will be considered significantly more important than price. Accordingly, award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A two-step source selection process will be conducted. Step 1 will consist of a Request for Proposal in which the following technical factors will be evaluated: 1. Relevant Past Performance / Corporate Experience; 2. Key Personnel Qualifications / Organizational Chart; 3. Project Management Plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Step 2 will consist of a Request for Proposal in which the following technical factors will be evaluated: 1. Subcontractors; 2. Project Schedule; 3. Construction Alternatives; 4. Small Disadvantaged Business (SBD) Participation; In addition, a price proposal will be requested as part of Step 2. Separate technical and price proposals will be required.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The project period of performance will be 24 months and the estimated price for this requirement is more than $10,000,000.00.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The solicitation can only be obtained by accessing the Federal Business <br />Opportunities website (FedBizOpps - https://www.fbo.gov). It is fully integrated with other electronic Government initiatives such as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal Agencies. In order to obtain information from FedBizOpps, you will first be required to register with CCR. The Central Contractor Registration database is part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative and will be used to validate vendor identity. Effective October 1, 2003, all Government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award. You may access CCR at the following URL, www.bpn.gov. Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedBizOpps. No federal documents or drawings can be downloaded until registration is completed at both sites. To insure that you receive all information regarding this requirement, please register to receive updates at www.fedbizopps.gov; follow the procedures for notification registration.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 04 is to answer Industry Questions.
Question:
1. Are multiple awards of $100K planned for Phase 1?
Answer:
Yes, as stated in the fifth paragraph of section IV.
Question:
2.  Are multiple awards planned for Phase 2?
Answer:
The number of awards in Phase II depends, in part, on performance during Phase I.
Question:
3.  Is there an order of magnitude per project or general idea of the dollar range set aside for Phase 2 programs in aggregate?
Answer:
No specific order of magnitude criteria per project has been set.
Question:
4.  If we wish to propose to Phase 2 in addition to Phase 1, is that proposal also due on December 8?
Answer:
Yes, if an offeror proposes to Phase 2 in addition to Phase 1, that proposal is also due on December 8.
Question:
5. Do the selection criteria for Phase 1 make it advantageous to submit a comprehensive multi-phase proposal now versus submitting just a Phase 1 proposal (including cost) at this time?
Answer:
The Government has no stated preference for - and will grant no additional credit to - proposals addressing both phases.
Question:
6.  Should we submit just a White Paper and cost for Phase 1 at this time, is it allowable to submit a full Phase 2 proposal (technical and cost) after the completion of Phase 1?
Answer:
It is up to the proposer whether to submit just a White Paper and cost for Phase 1 or a full proposal at this time.  As stated in Section VI, "full technical and cost proposals...are required for consideration for Phase 2 awards."  A full Phase 2 proposal submitted after the completion of Phase 1 will not meet the submission deadline to be eligible for award under this BAA.
