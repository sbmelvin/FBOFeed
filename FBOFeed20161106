This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). A RFP will be issued to the firm who is determined to be the most qualified based on the standard form SF-330 package submitted and based on the evaluations conducted with the source selection factors that are attached to this announcement. Estimated start date for this requirement is January 2017.

The A/E contract that is anticipated to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Brooks Act (Public Law 92- 582), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.6, and Department of Veteran Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 836.6.

Mileage Restriction: This procurement is restricted to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) located within a 200 mile driving distance from the Nashville VAMC located at 1310 24th Avenue South Nashville, TN 37212. The 200 mile restriction will be verified by using the shortest driving distance from the Nashville VAMC to a contractor s office from which the majority of the design services will be performed. This mileage restriction will be calculated using the following link: https://www.google.com/maps/dir//''/@36.1392717,-86.8070458,15z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x886466a250acfd41:0x894073a6a106b8d8!2m2!1d-86.8044571!2d36.1417423.
If said contractor s office is more than the 200 mile driving distance restriction to the Nashville VAMC, the contractor s SF330 package will not be evaluated by the source selection evaluation board (SSEB) and will not be considered for award. This mileage restriction is in compliance with VAAR 805.207.

The Nashville VAMC is seeking a professional A/E firm to provide all necessary A/E services as required to prepare complete contract drawings, specifications, technical reports, and cost estimates, including (optional) services throughout construction for "Replace AHU-3A for Sterile Processing Supply  in fan room #2, second floor, Building 1, at the Nashville VAMC. Work will include, but is not limited to, mechanical, electrical, architectural, fire protection, controls and limited structural. This project will replace the outdated, problematic air handling unit (AHU-3A) system serving Sterile Processing Supply for proper monitoring, control, optimization and reliability.
Digital copies of the as-builts are limited. The awardee will be expected to fully investigate and confirm the validity of hard copy as-builts and other drawings. This will include independent investigation of the Nashville VAMC s flat files by the consultant to determine and procure the information required for the complete design.
The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.
The project drawings/design shall be in compliance with applicable standards and codes described in VA Program Guides and design materials. Master Construction Specifications Index, VA Construction Standards Index, VA Standards Index, and Criteria are available in the Technical Information Library (TIL) on VA Website address: http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/.
The successful awardee will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside construction contractors can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A/E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Nashville VAMC must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A/E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330 with a small business size of $15 million.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, type in SF-330 in the  Find a Form  block and click on search.
Regulatory Restrictions
In accordance with VAAR 836.606-73, the total cost of the contracted for A/E services must not exceed six (6) percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR 52.236-2 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly qualified A/E firm selected to complete the design.
In accordance with FAR 36.209   Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer Firms and 36.606 (c)   Negotiations, all interested contractors are hereby put on notice that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that ultimately designs this requirement.
The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request for SF-330s. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.  
Registration Requirements
Before a SDVOSB is awarded a contract, the SDVOSB must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database under NAICs 541330. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov. Failure of firm to be verified in SAM prior to contract award shall result in elimination from consideration.
Offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70. Submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, by an offeror must be verified in CVE at the time the SF330 package is received by the CO based on NAICs 541330.  Failure to be both verified in VetBiz at the time SF330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.
