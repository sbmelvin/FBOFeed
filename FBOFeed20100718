<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil)</p>
<p>52.212-1 - INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror meets the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>(1) A copy of the Documentation reflecting RAL Deutsches Institut fuer Guetesicherung und Kennzeichnung e.V. certification is required to be provided with proposals. Proposal must be submitted on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>(2) The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(i) After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>(ii) Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest 5 proposals) against the evaluation factor identified in (a)(1) above.</p>
<p>(iii) By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>(iv) Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
