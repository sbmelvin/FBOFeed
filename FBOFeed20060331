<DESC>This synopsis is issued to notify Faith Based Institutions in the District of Columbia that Court  Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) for the District of Columbia requires Faith Based Coordination Services for Offender Reintegration on a firm-fixed price, contractual basis.  The planned contract will consist of a one year base and 4 one year options.  CSOSA may award multiple contracts under the solicitation to be issued for this requirement, which will ONLY be electronically issued on the FedBizzOpps website (www.fbo.gov), along any amendments thereto.  A Faith Based Institution shall be a house of worship such as a mosque, temple, or church, or an entity whose membership is composed primarily of clergy and which is affiliated with one or more houses of worship.  Such house of worship shall currently exist within the District of Columbia geographical boundaries.  CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997.  CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in and on behalf of the District of Columbia.  Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities.  In January 2002, CSOSA announced the inception of a broad-based support system that involves community supervision and the faith community in a concerted effort to: reduce recidivism rates among offenders under CSOSA supervision; improve public safety in the District by facilitating successful re-entry of offenders into the community; develop partnership or mentorship programs with stakeholders in an effort to meet mutual goals; and build capacity of Faith Based Institutions to increase the likelihood of future successful collaborative relationships.  Therefore, CSOSA intends to contract for cluster coordinative leadership in specific geographic areas within the District of Columbia.  A cluster is a group of Faith-Based Institutions, located in a designated geographical area, that has formed a partnership and has agreed to participate jointly in providing Faith-Based Reintegration Services.  Cluster coordinative leadership shall include, but is not limited to, assisting the Government and other participating Faith Based Institutions in identifying, expanding and applying the various ministries and outreach program strategies, building capacity for program management and analysis, furthering the development of a case management system to track offenders referred to the program, and implementing a volunteer management program to accurately track availability of mentors and other volunteers that are responsive to the needs of the reentering offenders and their families.  The lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall provide all necessary personnel, supervision, equipment, materials and supplies to facilitate and coordinate Faith Based Reintegration Service delivery for offenders.  The Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall also perform varied data collection and reporting duties on behalf of all participating Faith Based Institutions in a cluster.  It shall be expressly agreed and understood that the planned contract(s) is a nonpersonal services contract(s), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.101, under which the professional services rendered by the Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) are rendered in its capacity as an independent contractor.  The successful Faith Based Institution (contractor) will be selected using a best value approach, with technical criteria being equal in importance to price / cost.  The proposed contract(s) is 100% set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813110 with a small business size standard of $6.5 MIL.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract.  Such registration may be accomplished at www.ccr.gov.  A paper copy of this solicitation will not be available to requestors and, therefore, the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  It is incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the solicitation via this website (once it is issued) in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt may render a proposal ineligible for award.  The solicitation issue date will around 23 January 2006.  Proposal submittal requirements will be identified in SECTION L of the solicitation and timely proposals (offers) will be evaluated in accordance with SECTION M.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Governments ultimate selection approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation cost.

<DESC>Background Information: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is tasked with security responsibilities for all modes of the national transportation system.  Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) is one of TSA’s key credentialing programs.  The program is focused on the development of an advanced-technology credentialing system.  The TWIC program encompasses all personnel whose duties require unescorted physical or logical (cyber) access to secure areas of the transportation system.  The TWIC credentialing system includes biometrics, public key infrastructure (PKI), and other advanced technologies to improve the security of physical and logical access systems. XXXXXX  TSA intends to establish a nationwide fee based contract for enrollment, help desk, operation and maintenance (O&M) of the ID Management System (IDMS) and future IDMS enhancements for the TWIC program.  IDMS is a centralized database to enable streamlined operations, protection of personal privacy and maintenance of a chain of trust. The TWIC program provides a method to prevent unauthorized access to secure areas of the transportation system that will have the following capabilities:  a. Field a common, secure credential that is interoperable across all transportation modes and is compatible with existing independent access control systems;  b. Verify the identity of each TWIC applicant, complete a background check on the identified applicant, and positively link the issued credential to that applicant; and
c. Quickly revoke access privileges to TWIC holders who are identified as threats after issuance of their credentials, and immediately remove lost, stolen, or compromised cards from the system.  XXXXXX  The TWIC program consists of four phases:

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations having the capability to carry out clinical studies to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of new medications for drug abuse treatment.  As medications are often taken with other treatment drugs or drugs of abuse (such as cocaine, methamphetamine, etc), information on the extent and nature of the interaction between the medications and other treatment drugs/drugs of abuse will also be a focus of this contract.  Such studies require the intravenous administration of abused drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, to human subjects.  Since a prerequisite for PK studies is the availability of specific assay methods for the quantitative determination of drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids (e.g. plasma, urine, feces, saliva, sweat, etc), this project also includes the development and validation of analytical methods, identification of metabolites, and quantification of drug/metabolites in biological samples collected from the clinical studies.  In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that offerors possess a DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.  The offerors must have an OHRP-approved assurance of compliance with the HHS regulations (45 CFR 46.103) for the protection of human subjects and must have a board certified physician on the project
The data obtained will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of INDs (Investigational New Drugs) and NDAs (New Drug Applications).  All studies must be carried out under pertinent FDA regulations, such as current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) and current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) regulations.  The pertinent FDA's guidelines/guidance shall be followed.  It is estimated that a three?year incrementally funded completion?type contract with options to extend up to two additional years & additional option quantities. RFP No.  N01DA-6-8867 will be available electronically on or about April 17, 2006.  You can access the RFP through the FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website at the following address: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html. The electronic RFP contains all information needed to submit a proposal. No printed version of the solicitation document or source list is available. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. Proposals will be due on or about June 1, 2006. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. See note 26.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the design, development, test, and evaluation (DDT&E) of an engine to support the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) Upper Stage and the Cargo Launch Vehicle (CaLV) Earth Departure Stage (EDS).  The engine, a J-2 (Saturn Heritage engine) derivative, will be a 250,000 pound thrust class human-rated engine and is planned to support a human launch of the CLV in 2012.  The baseline DDT&E effort will require the delivery of seven development and qualification engines with two spares, two development test flight engines, and one human flight engine.   Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, NASA/MSFC intends to purchase this requirement from Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) Inc., 6633 Canoga Avenue, Canoga Park, California, 91309-7922.  PWR designed and developed the original J-2 series of engines and has been responsible for its production, refurbishment, and improvements.  PWR's unique capabilities with design, fabrication, production, and testing of the turbomachinery for the J-2 series was proven most recently on NASA's X-33 program.  The J-2 design is the only engine ever produced in the United States that possesses the performance capabilities required and currently has a sufficient Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to fulfill agency requirements.  In addition, PWR has recent experience on other major engine development activities such as the RS-83, RS-84, and COBRA.  Any attempt to procure this requirement from another vendor would make fielding the CLV improbable within the planned timeframe.  The production effort for the engine beyond the requirements of the DDT&E effort will be a separate procurement.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities, qualifications and approach to produce the engine in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 14, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact PWR directly. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS 
The downstream fish passage measures of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NPCC) Fish and Wildlife Program include flow augmentation and voluntary spill to mitigate for the effects of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) on anadromous and resident fish. The program also includes monitoring and evaluation to assess the progress in accomplishing the biological objectives of the program at a basin-wide level. A Fish Passage Center (FPC) was included in the mainstem program (NPCC 2003).  The primary purpose of the FPC has been to provide technical assistance and information to Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Tribal Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the general public on matters related to juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead passage through the mainstem hydrosystem. 

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was selected by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to develop and provide a process for responding to requests for technical analysis. The process will incorporate rigorous peer review to ensure the highest standards of data quality and scientific integrity are met for technical products delivered to regional managers and researchers. The peer-reviewed technical analysis products that result will provide information to fisheries managers on matters related to juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead passage through the mainstem hydrosystem, as well as implications for resident fish.

PNNL is seeking to establish a pool of qualified individuals to serve as Technical Analysts and Technical Reviewers. The following is a brief description of the responsibilities for each category:
Technical Analysts:  Individuals are needed to conduct technical analyses relating to fish passage and the operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). These requests will involve analyses concerning alternative operational scenarios or other management actions and their influence on the passage or survival of juvenile and adult salmon, steelhead, and resident fish. Analyses will require the integration of passage, survival, operational, and environmental information to analyze, summarize and interpret fish passage data, as well as data available from other sources to address basin-wide as well as project-specific fish passage issues
Technical Reviewers:  Individuals are needed to participate in a peer review panel for the products produced in response to technical analysis requests. The peer reviewers would be expected to respond to a written request for review of a technical analysis product. Those reviewers will prepare a report that describes the nature of their review and their findings and conclusions. That report would critique the product on how well it addresses the objectives of the original request and suggest ways to clarify assumptions, findings, or conclusions. The report would also identify oversights, omissions, and inconsistencies. When needed, the report would include comments and recommendations to the analyst for incorporation prior to final approval by reviewers and release of the product to the requestor and the public.

Interested parties that wish to be considered for both roles should indicate the position they prefer, because an individual will not be allowed to serve in both roles.
To be considered for one of these positions, interested parties should email Julie Hughes at Julie.Hughes@pnl.gov. A formal Request for Qualifications package will be transmitted to all respondents.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Ms. Hughes at (509) 372-3943.

<DESC>8.  Is it possible to arrange for a representative site visit at one or more of the facilities listed in the solicitation prior to submission of a proposal? Answer: There will only be site visits for individual task orders. 9.  Assuming the acquisition strategy of the government holds to its current schedule, when can the company(s) determined to be qualified for bidding on future task orders expect the first task order? Answer:  The expected first task order is June 2006. 10.  Once task orders are released for bid by qualified bidders, how often are task orders expected? Answer: We expect to release task orders yearly. 11.  How much time will be allowed for bidders to prepare and submit proposals on task orders? Answer:  Thirty (30) days will be allotted for bidders to prepare and submit proposals on task orders. 12.  For clarification purposes, are companies selected to bid on future task orders required to bid on any or all task orders? Answer:  Companies should only bid on task orders that they are capable of performing. 13.  What are the government's expectations under any resultant contract as they apply to vendor rebates received on the purchase of supplies? Answer:  The government expectations are to receive volume discounts off of invoices.  Contractors can propose a tiered discount as part of their proposal. 14.  Is the proposal for this solicitation and its contents binding in any way on the bidder? Answer:  The proposals are binding, and should represent the worst case scenario pricing. 15.  Would the government consider price ranges to be acceptable in a proposal for this solicitation? Answer:  No, the government is not considering price ranges to be acceptable.  The government is asking for worst case scenario prices. 16.  Determination of proposal pricing for this solicitation is particularly complicated by the lack of knowledge of the facilities against which the proposal is being prepared.  For example, no information as to the floor coverings, types of floors, number of operating rooms, etc. is provided in the solicitation.  It is understood that future task orders will include individual facility data, but it is our desire to build the best possible proposal for your consideration. Answer:  Proposed prices should be worst case scenario.  The offeror will complete the projected productivity/staffing chart based on the maximum estimated quantity of square feet (sq. ft.) of basic HAMS as shown in Section B of the solicitation.  See Attachment (C) excel spreadsheet for example. Failure to properly price the “maximum” hours per foot/month (as derived from the “worst case” productivity) in the price proposal will result in a higher risk of performance being assessed to the offeror in the technical proposal evaluation. 17.  Productivity/Staffing Chart - pg 94, column H.  Is the formula correct?  Should it read (gx12)? Answer:  Column H is (G X 12) and we are also providing an example spreadsheet for an example.  See attached (C) excel spreadsheet that explains each column.  18.  Productivity/Staffing Chart has the square footage different than that in the Schedule B.  Am I to assume that for the bidding exercise that I compute the total dollars based upon the square footage of Schedule B using the cost per square foot build up from the Productivity/Staffing Chart calculated hours?  (i.e. RS #1 productivity/staffing has max. est. sq ft per month of 50,000 sq ft but the Schedule B has 97,030 max. est. sq ft per month) Answer:  The Productivity/Staffing Chart is corrected in Amendment 4, which references Schedule B (i.e. RS#1--- 97,030 max. est. sq. ft. per month). 19.  PWS page 43, 2.35 is reserved but the productivity/staffing chart and Schedule B show square footage under RS 11.  Please advise. Answer:  PWS page, 2.35 is amended to include the following definition:  RS Category 11 is 7 day per week incineration of medical regulated waste and cleaning the inside of the incinerator.  (Reference 5.4.) 20.  Question:  The RS productivity chart to be submitted in volume 1 part 2 requires the bidders to propose non productive hours as a % of productive hours. Section L does not provide any data or parameters for determining this percentage.  Without information from a particular CBA or Wage Determination as to entitlements for sick, holiday, vacation, etc. there is no way to determine an appropriate %.   Can contracting provide the specific % to be used or some parameters for the bidders to apply to determine this %? Answer:  The contractor is to propose a balanced proposal of what labor burden hours are as a percentage of hours actually worked.     21.  The following questions pertain to the subject solicitation: a. In the 1449's item # 0016AH "Fiscal year 2007 CBA adjustment" Will a CBA be issued for this info?  Answer:  The salary will be assigned by task order.  The RFP provides labor rates for evaluation purposes only. b. In the 1449's items # 0013, 0014 and 0015. The salary for the EH, Assist. EH and Clinic Manager should not/ would not be the same for all parts of the country and or the size of the facility. How will the salary be adjusted? Answer:  Refer to volume III page 97 which states what labor rates to use for evaluation purposes only. c. In the 1449s item # 0016AA Light Fixture Cleaning, # 0016AB Exterior Window Wash, # 0016AC Interior Duct Cleaning, and # 0016AD Remove and Re-hang Drapes/Curtains. This work is normally sub-contracted... Will an adjustment be made based on cost for that particular site and location? Answer:  The unit price should be based on one (1) full time equivalent (FTE) if “months” are stated in the CLIN, and one (1) Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) is being considered for this task.  If “jobs” are stated in the CLIN, then the unit price should be based on the number of FTE(s) to be equivalent to the number of jobs.  The contractor should propose enough money (based on worst case) to ensure the IDIQ pricing they propose would enable them to do the work at a profit.   d. 1.3.4.4 Training provided by the Government. How/where do we account for this time seeing as each Hospital would have more or less employees? What is the total amount of time to be allocated for the training per employee? Answer:  Pricing will be adjusted when task orders are awarded according to that facilities location. e. Under Price Proposal on page 96 of 113 the solicitation states "Volume III will consist of a signed and completed solicitation document, signed solicitation amendments (returned in full)"...  There have been no SF-30's posted...How do we sign and return in full, solicitation amendments? 	Answer:  The SF-30’s are attached in amendment 4.l 22.	Can I get a list of interested sources? Answer:  A list of interested vendors can be found on Fedbizopps when doing a search on the RFP number under the find business opportunities function. The following is a list of vendors that have expressed an interest in the solicitation: EMD Services, Inc.			Priority Building Services		 	Government Resources Group LLC		National Maintenance Inc.		 	Kentucky Building Maintenance, Inc.	Hospital Klean of Texas, Inc.		 	McKenna Enterprises			Interstate Building Maintenance, Inc.	 	Integrity Management Services Incorporated		 23.  Based on the questions, answers and changes with Mod 03, it is now clear that a Small Business Subcontracting Plan is required with Technical Volume I.  FYI – On Page 81 of the Solicitation, Clause 52.219-9 is still listed as Not Applicable.   The Alternate II is marked X to revise paragraph c. of the basic clause, but the clause itself is N/A.  There seems to a conflict here? 	Answer:  The Clause 52.219-9 and Alternate II is applicable and has been amended to be marked X. 24.  Is the Excel Attachment Schedule B intended to replace pages 6 through 29 of the Solicitation documents or are we supposed to submit prices on both documents? Answer:  The solicitation and Attachment Schedule B has been corrected to reflect each other.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS IS ONLY MODIFIED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT CLOSING DATE FOR THE SOLICITATION POSTED ON THIS WEBSITE.  This synopsis is issued to notify Faith Based Institutions in the District of Columbia that Court  Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) for the District of Columbia requires Faith Based Coordination Services for Offender Reintegration on a firm-fixed price, contractual basis.  The planned contract will consist of a one year base and 4 one year options.  CSOSA may award multiple contracts under the solicitation to be issued for this requirement, which will ONLY be electronically issued on the FedBizzOpps website (www.fbo.gov), along any amendments thereto.  A Faith Based Institution shall be a house of worship such as a mosque, temple, or church, or an entity whose membership is composed primarily of clergy and which is affiliated with one or more houses of worship.  Such house of worship shall currently exist within the District of Columbia geographical boundaries.  CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997.  CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in and on behalf of the District of Columbia.  Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities.  In January 2002, CSOSA announced the inception of a broad-based support system that involves community supervision and the faith community in a concerted effort to: reduce recidivism rates among offenders under CSOSA supervision; improve public safety in the District by facilitating successful re-entry of offenders into the community; develop partnership or mentorship programs with stakeholders in an effort to meet mutual goals; and build capacity of Faith Based Institutions to increase the likelihood of future successful collaborative relationships.  Therefore, CSOSA intends to contract for cluster coordinative leadership in specific geographic areas within the District of Columbia.  A cluster is a group of Faith-Based Institutions, located in a designated geographical area, that has formed a partnership and has agreed to participate jointly in providing Faith-Based Reintegration Services.  Cluster coordinative leadership shall include, but is not limited to, assisting the Government and other participating Faith Based Institutions in identifying, expanding and applying the various ministries and outreach program strategies, building capacity for program management and analysis, furthering the development of a case management system to track offenders referred to the program, and implementing a volunteer management program to accurately track availability of mentors and other volunteers that are responsive to the needs of the reentering offenders and their families.  The lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall provide all necessary personnel, supervision, equipment, materials and supplies to facilitate and coordinate Faith Based Reintegration Service delivery for offenders.  The Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall also perform varied data collection and reporting duties on behalf of all participating Faith Based Institutions in a cluster.  It shall be expressly agreed and understood that the planned contract(s) is a nonpersonal services contract(s), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.101, under which the professional services rendered by the Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) are rendered in its capacity as an independent contractor.  The successful Faith Based Institution (contractor) will be selected using a best value approach, with technical criteria being equal in importance to price / cost.  The proposed contract(s) is 100% set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813110 with a small business size standard of $6.5 MIL.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract.  Such registration may be accomplished at www.ccr.gov.  A paper copy of this solicitation will not be available to requestors and, therefore, the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  It is incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the solicitation via this website (once it is issued) in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt may render a proposal ineligible for award.  The solicitation issue date will around 23 January 2006.  Proposal submittal requirements will be identified in SECTION L of the solicitation and timely proposals (offers) will be evaluated in accordance with SECTION M.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Governments ultimate selection approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation cost.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four phases:  Phase 1 – Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 – Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has a requirement to study basic, translational, and clinical research aimed at the discovery and/or identification of better therapeutic and diagnostic medical countermeasures against chemical threat agents and their movement through the regulatory process.  The overall goal of this research program is to enhance our diagnostic and treatment response capabilities during an emergency.  The NIH requires a nontraditional, proactive, and product development oriented program to provide preclinical development support for promising therapeutic candidates.  The Preclinical Development Facility will be part of a comprehensive research network and is designed to support a centralized facility for the advanced preclinical development of promising candidate pharmaceutical preparations.  Any resultant Contractor will be required to conduct safety, toxicology, pharmacokinetic/dynamic, biodistribution, and chemistry and manufacturing studies with candidate drugs that prevent or mitigate the harmful effects of chemical threat agents.  The facility shall not conduct efficacy studies with drugs; nor shall they conduct studies with the chemical agents themselves.  Candidate drugs that will be tested in this facility shall have been previously shown to be efficacious by studies conducted within the CounterACT Research Network that utilize models for, or actual, chemical agents.  This facility would provide several functions:  1) conduct cGLP absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, including PK/PD studies, in a range of animal species for candidate drugs; 2) conduct cGLP toxicology safety studies for candidate drugs; 3) conduct cGMP optimization and control studies including synthesis, composition, formulation and packaging, and stability; and 4) prepare study reports and recommendations for countermeasure modification, if necessary.  
It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years beginning September, 2006.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-06-04 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address:  (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26.*****

<DESC>The National Pandemic Plan of 2005 designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness and response. Following the issuance of the HHS Pandemic Plan of 2005, the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was assigned the responsibility for the advanced development, establishment of surge capacity, and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as diagnostics, vaccines  and antiviral drugs that may be used to diagnosis, contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza pandemics in the U.S. The tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these pandemic medical countermeasures is the responsibility of the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP.   
 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. The Office of Research Development and Coordination of the Office of Public Health Emergency HHS/OPHEP/ORDC has an interest in identifying potential technologies, methods, assays and reagents that can be applied to the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of influenza virus infections and disease. The appropriate use of diagnostic assays and equipment during influenza seasonal or pandemic outbreaks may provide for more timely and accurate detection of influenza outbreaks and thus delay or contain influenza infections in local communities, may reduce the morbidity and mortality, and may mitigate the overwhelming load that will be placed on the healthcare system. Early detection of influenza by the use of appropriate tests will allow for an accurate triage of patients and the determination of the parameters of the pandemic in enough time to provide best use of disease spread countermeasures. Rapid, accurate high throughput laboratory bench systems and portable low cost point of care (POC) systems are both needed to identify the outbreak as quickly as possible and provide timely data and information for situational awareness to guide and monitor effective response measures. Responses to this RFI may address either or both of these areas of identified interest but should clearly indicate which area of need is being addressed in the response. 

Rapid diagnostics for influenza viruses currently lack sufficient specificity and sensitivity and timeliness of results to provide clinically relevant information. A need is present to have diagnostic platforms and assays for influenza and influenza like illnesses to provide timely diagnostic information to health care providers in the face of an emerging pandemic. Information is being sought on assays, methods and platforms that may meet near term and long-term program needs. 

High Through-put Bench Diagnostics tests should be:
1) Rapid: less than 4 hours from sample collection to results at point of care
 
2) Sensitive: the exact lower confidence bound for the 2-sided 95% CI should be greater than 95%, relative to culture at clinically significant levels of virus (10E1 to 10E6 TCID50/mL of a specified influenza A virus strain
 
3)Specific: better than 95% ability to differentiate the target organism in the presence of ten fold excess of near neighbors to distinguish specific strains of influenza virus

4)Cost effective: less than four dollars per organism characteristic identified, 12 dollars total per test cost (exclusive of test reader equipment cost if needed)

5)Flexible: able to be modified for newly emergent threats within weeks of their discovery

6)Cross-Reactivity: able to detect true positives and true negatives in the presence of typical commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, typically 108 TCID50 viruses, 108 bacteria or 106 yeasts per ml

7)Diagnostic would be used on currently available and widely used commercial diagnostic platforms where trained personnel are used in CLIA compliant settings. 

Point of Care Diagnostics tests should be:
1)Rapid: less than 30 minutes from sample collection to results at point of care
 
2)Sensitive: the exact lower confidence bound for the 2-sided 95% CI should be greater than 95%, relative to culture at clinically significant levels of virus (10E1 to 10E6 TCID50/mL of a specified influenza A virus strain

3)Specific: better than 95% ability to differentiate the target organism in the presence of ten fold excess of near neighbors to distinguish specific strains of influenza virus

4)Cost effective: less than four dollars per organism characteristic identified, 12 dollars total per test cost (exclusive of test reader equipment cost if needed)

5)Flexible: able to be modified for newly emergent threats within weeks of their discovery

6)Cross-Reactivity: able to detect true positives and true negatives in the presence of typical commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, typically 108 TCID50 viruses, 108 bacteria or 106 yeasts per ml.

7)Ideally testing can be done in multiple settings with minimum operator training; rapid tests should be adaptable to near patient testing (either CLIA waived or under supervision of a central laboratory

Combinations of sample preparations, screening tests and confirmation tests may be able to meet such over all requirements. The initial testing capability may require assays based on currently available commercial platforms but ideal future capabilities should accommodate all the indicated desired assay and system characteristics including purchase price, per assay costs, weight, foot print, sensitivity and specificity performances. 

An acceptable system would be easily portable  with a simple clinical sample loading design. The equipment should isolate the sample in a manner that minimizes bio-safety concerns and cross contamination concerns for subsequent or concurrent sample handling. An acceptable POC system would be capable of meeting system requirements of performance from sample collection to test result for 1 sample within 30 minutes by 1 technician. Sample types could include: Nasal and throat swabs, Nasal wash aspirates, Blood, or Urine. 

The instrument-based system or assay should be able to identify the 20 leading causes (bacterial, fungal and viral) of respiratory illness clinical presentation with Influenza Like Illness symptoms,  and differentiate novel influenza A viruses from seasonal influenza A viruses (i.e., H1N1 and H3N2) and other respiratory pathogens. Influenza or Influenza like Pathogens should be identified with a high level of certainty, using at least two characteristics per pathogen. Methods should be able to detect and differentiate specific influenza strains.  Genotypic or phenotypic characterization should include capability to discriminate phylogenetic relationships including gene swaps, or influenza serotypes.  Reagents should be optimized for maximum self-life with corresponding positive and negative controls. Desired reagent shelf life should be at least 6 months at room temperature.  Integrated sample prep and detection with minimal sample handling during the analysis would be optimal. Serial or batch sample analysis to maximize throughput would be ideal. If a reader or equipment is involved integrated Bi-Directional communication monitoring Software to report out results,  interpolate detection metrics, interpret the presence or absence of each pathogen , report results and receiving protocol updates should be discussed. Discussion of data optimization management systems is of interest for quality management and quality control measures during the life cycle of the device including developmental, testing and field use of the equipment or assay.

HHS will use information obtained by this RFI in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Please submit information in the following format:
1)     Name of Submitter
2)     Address of Submitter
3)     Name of Device, Assay or technology
4)     Technical / Method Summary
5)     Device specifications
6)     Performance Summary including any supportive data
7)     Clinical samples tested to date
8)     Viral straines tested to date
9)     Points of Contact
10)    Bibliography and/or References

Information must be submitted by April 21, 2006. Responses should be limited to 20 pages, 12 Font, Times Roman,  single space, one sided or equivalent in an electronic and hard copy formats and can be e-mailed to the attention of Jeff Miller, Contract Specialist, phone 770-488-2651, e-mail afx2@cdc.gov.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is seeking sources capable of providing the agency with an antibiotic-residue proficiency test (PT) program.  The samples shall be such that they can be analyzed using the 7-plate bioassay as described in the FSIS Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook, Chapter 34. A description of this assay may be found at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/ophs/Microlab/Mlg34.01.pdf.                                                                                
The samples must be such that they can be analyzed using the 7-plate bioassay system. The respondent will need to be able to generate or submit PT samples of at least 65 grams that contain any of the following at the concentrations indicated:
Ampicillin 	0.05 ppm to 1.0 ppm; Chlortetracycline	1.0 ppm to 15.0 ppm; Dihydrostreptomycin	0.5 ppm to 2.0 ppm;
Erythromycin	0.25 ppm to 1.0 ppm;
Gentamicin sulfate	0.7 ppm to 12.0 ppm;
Neomycin	1.0 ppm to 20.0 ppm;
Oxytetracycline	0.5 ppm to 15.0 ppm;
Penicillin	0.05 ppm to 1.0 ppm;
Streptomycin	0.5 ppm to 8.0 ppm;
Tetracycline	0.5 ppm to 15 ppm;
Tilmicosin	1.0 ppm to 8.0 ppm;
Tylosin	1.0 ppm to 16ppm.                                                  

The potential supplier would provide PT samples that meet the requirements of ISO 17025.  These requirements are described with additional detail in the 2004 ALACC Criteria Section 5.9 of the AOAC International Guidelines for Laboratories Performing Microbiological and Chemical Analyses of Food and Pharmaceuticals. Information on the requirements may be obtained from the International Organization for Standardization (http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=39883&ICS1=3&ICS2=120&ICS3=20) or from AOAC International (http://www.aoac.org/pubs/critforlabs.htm).  Suppliers who can also meet the requirements of ISO/IEC Guide 43, Part 1 (http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=27217&ICS1=3&ICS2=120&ICS3=20 ) would be most suitable. 

The potential suppliers must describe the types of samples they can provide, including the form or matrix of the samples.  They must also submit their plans for assuring the homogeneity of the PT samples, and for evaluating and reporting results.  

At this time only one FSIS laboratory would participate in analysis of these PT samples.  The Agriculture Marketing System of USDA participates in the antibiotic PT program which is currently conducted by the FSIS.  If a supplier is found we will stop this program.  The USDA AMS may also choose to participate in the potential supplier’s antibiotic PT program.

If you are a source capable of providing such a PT program please respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis with your company information, along with pricing information.  Respondents are asked to identify their business size in their response to this sources sought synopsis.  The NAICS Code associated with this notice is 541990 and the size standard is not to exceed $6,000,000.  This notice is not a request for proposals and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information they provide.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, the information will be used in FSIS’s assessment of capable sources.  Responses should be submitted by May 31, 2006.  Faxed responses are not permitted.  Questions concerning this announcement may be submitted via email only, no telephone inquires will be honored.

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron, intends to award a one-year base plus four options,  Firm Fixed Price contract with SecureInfo Corporation, on a sole source basis for PACAF Bases' Networks Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Support Services, by utilizing the SecureInfo Corporation developed proprietary software.  Place of performance will be at multi-installation within the Pacific Air Forces, including geographical separated units.  The principal feature of this requirement include but not limited to: Certification and Accreditation (C&A) support, Information Assurance support, and technical advice to the PACAF Chief Information Officer, the Headquarters Communications and Information Directorate, and the Networks Division, to include ensuring the following information technology services, to train personnel in C&A maintenance of the base networks using the Risk Management System (RMS), the automated PACAF Enterprise C&A solution, to continue management and upgrades of RMS, to oversee established base C&A efforts including the base network C&A packages currently contained in RMS, and to provide Information Assurance (IA) recommendations consistent with applicable Department of Defense and Air Force regulations.  All contractor personnel are required to have a Secret security clearance, to be a US citizen, and to be fluent in written and spoken English.  RMS™, the automated PACAF Enterprise C&A solution, software was developed and maintained by SecureInfo Corporation.  In addition, SecureInfo authored Air Force instructions that direct the C&A process, therefore award to another source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government, loss of expertise and knowledge to the Government that would not be recovered through competition, and would greatly impact efforts to maintain the security posture of PACAF networks.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In accordance with regulatory procedures found within Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.205(c) and Part 5.301(b)(7)(ii), interested parties submitting clear and convincing data substantiating their capabilities to satisfy this requirement have until 6 Apr 06 to submit their qualifications/capabilities.

<DESC>NOTICE:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the small business and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein.  The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified Small Business concerns capable of determining how hatchery domestication reduces fitness of naturally spawning salmon and identifying approaches to reduce these harmful effects. In the short term, the study will provide estimates of relative reproductive success of hatchery and wild lines in the wild, identify of key life history differences contributing to differences in viability between hatchery and wild fish, and estimate the risks to viability imposed by one generation of hatchery culture. In the longer term, it will provide quantitative estimates of hatchery effects on long-term population viability and will determine the best approach to managing hatchery populations to reduce domestication selection.  Deliverables will be: 1. Create two selected “segregated” lines representing extremes for run or spawn timing and one control “integrated” line of coho salmon to yield at least 120 total families  2. Track pedigrees of all wild fish returning to the weir using molecular genetic analysis to allow measurement of evolutionary processes in the wild “control” populations 3. Test whether individuals have responded to selection for run timing by comparing returning wild  and hatchery fish from each line; test response in correlated characters  4. Continue broodstock protocols (segregated and integrated) on returning and maturing F1 adults to allow trend analyses 5. Measure the relative reproductive success of fish of all three lines in a stream or spawning channel. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Region Acquisition Division (WRAD) will be awarded.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Estimated cost is between $1 and 5 Million.  All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  No solicitation document is available.   No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice.

Sources are sought for a potential, initial 5 year pilot program (single award) that will provide third party chemical management services support to the 76th MXW Maintenance Wing facility at OC-ALC.  The prospective CMS provider will act as the single point of contact for all chemical transactions to include hazardous material.  The following items may be included in this initiative:  paints, welding equipment, sealants, adhesives, lubricants, and gases (Federal Supply Classes 8010, 3439, 8030, 8040, 9150, 6810, 6830, 6850, 5350, 9150, and 9340).  Approximately 600 – 800 NSNs may be covered under this initiative with the possibility for additional NSNs after contract award.  However, items to be included in this effort may not be limited to those identified in this notice.  The anticipated scope of services is:

Forecasting collaboration with OC-ALC – accurately predicting future requirements/demand patterns.
Procurement/purchasing – prospective CMS provider will be responsible for all actions related to the acquisition and delivery of specific chemical NSNs. 
Inventory management/storage/warehousing – the direction and control of activities with the purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right form at the right cost.
Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) services (to include waste collection & possibly disposal) – to provide an effective, sound, environmentally safe occupational health management system.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other pertinent procedures, regulations, manuals, and guidance documents that support environmentally sound management.
Data management – to include IT solutions suitable to the customer at OC-ALC - providing business data such as material costs, service fees tracked by department, and operational data. 


SUMMARY

One of the elements to be gained from this sources sought is to gauge the industry for chemical management services capability and determine the socioeconomic status of the industry base for this type of initiative.  All respondents are requested to indicate their business size status under the proposed NAICS codes (325510 & 325188) and whether or not their company qualifies in any sub-category (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB).  Offers should not be included.  This initiative is still under consideration and currently in a market research phase.  Please send your notice of interest to Diane Sadler, Acquisition Specialist, Email diane.sadler@dla.mil, no later than 21 April 2006.

It is anticipated this effort may move forward within the next 120 days.  In the event this initiative moves forward, a website will be available for updates to this CMS program at http://www.dscr.dla.mil/UserWeb/FAGA/index.html, under “Specialized Support” click on “CMS”.

The primary purpose of this contract is to establish and sustain effective and efficient managed life cycle support of Nuclear Weapon Sub-Systems (NWSS) components.  The NWSS Aging & Surveillance (A&S) Program is designed to establish and monitor the reliability and safety of aged components after exposure to operational conditions.  The A&S results are used in establishing Service Life Estimates on critical components, thus allowing Service Life Extensions (SLE) where possible or permitting orderly re-procurement and replacement before system reliability or safety have degraded. The prospective contractor must possess extensive knowledge of cruise missile NWSS, missile interfaces and warhead interfaces and must possess the facilities and skills necessary to test cruise missile NWSS in accordance with original system specifications. The prospective contractor must also possess extensive knowledge of and be able to maintain the unique test equipment and software applications that have been developed for use in A&S testing as well as the unique Data Analysis application used to develop the SLE. This contract will also provide a vehicle for addressing sustainment issues and anomaly investigations for all Cruise Missile NWSS and test systems used for reliability testing of the NWSS components.  The Cruise Missile Nuclear Weapon Sub-System sustainment requirements include not only the electrical and mechanical hardware interface between the Department Of Defense (DOD) managed missile and the Department Of Energy (DOE) managed warhead, but also the array of associated unique test and handling equipment. The prospective contractor must possess extensive knowledge of both the NWSS and reliability test systems in order to provide both sustainment of the systems and investigation/analysis of any test anomalies. The GFE and Test Sets are owned by the Government, however, the procedures and software to run the tests are not owned by the Government. This acquisition is for 1 basic year and 4 option years with an estimated award date of 31 July 06.  The type of contract is proposed to be a combination of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Time & Material (T&M) contracts.

<SUBJECT>R -- Clarification of 1Feb 2006 Industry Day
<DESC>During the 1 February 2006, Industry Day briefing, the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) A4A6 Director identified several potential contract requirements that will need contractor suppor and provided the status of the UNI-Comm acquisition. 

The briefing also identified 21 CONS and the Air Force as having already awarded some Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that may meet the identified needs.   In accordance with Air Force and AFSPC policy, if the new requirement fits the scope of any of the below identified contracts, then 21 CONS will follow the mandate and use the existing contracts to obtain the support rather than establish a new contract.  For reference purposes, please see the following contract descriptions of the existing Air Force and AFSPC contracts and acquisitions: 

CAASETA (Contract Advisory and Assistance, Scientific, Engineering, and Technical Assistance Services) – Consists of four IDIQ contracts that were awarded in Nov 2004 by 21 CONS to provide AFSPC with technical and analytical tools; support or improve policy development, management and administration and improve the operation of systems supporting the AFSPC Mission. The prime contractors are bd Systems, Booz Allen Hamilton, Scitor Inc, and SI International. The period of performance is Nov 2004 – 31 Oct 2009.  Task Orders awarded are either Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee or Firm-Fixed Price.  The program has $610 Million Ceiling. The small businesses contractors (bd Systems and Scitor) are guaranteed a minimum of 40% of the task order dollars.  POCs are as follows:  AFSPC/A7Z, Mr Russ Ogrinz  (719) 554-3589,  21 CONS/LGCCB, Ms LeAunna Ingram (719) 556-8351, AFSPC/A4A6XX, Mr Gene Boedigheimer, (719) 554-3319

C4I2TSR  (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Information Technology, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Services) – The C4I2TSR contract was awarded by 21 CONS in Apr 2004 for the capability to engineer, integrate, furnish equipment and materials, install and test (EFI&T) and provide operations and maintenance, and allied support for a wide range of current and future C4I2TSR systems world-wide.  It is a single award IDIQ contract to SI International.  The period of performance is Apr 2004 – 30 Sep 2013 if all options are exercised and the ceiling is $800 million.  It is a 100% small business set-aside.  POCs are as follows:  21 CONS/LGCCA, Ms Tracie O’Donovan, (719) 556-8775; AFSPC/A6NX, Mr Dave Horaz, (719) 554-5175; AFSPC/A6NXC, Maj Gary Elliott, (719) 554-5054

NETCENTS – The Air Force awarded eight IDIQ contracts designed to support Standards enforcement, e-Commerce capability, technology refresh, purchase integrated solutions; COTS products; engineering services; life cycle management support.  The prime contract holders are The Centech Group, MultiMax, Northrop Grumman, NCI Information Systems, Booz Allen Hamilton, Telos Group, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. Four contracts are awarded to small businesses.  The period of performance is five years. Please refer to the NETCENTS  website for ordering procedures.  POCs are as follows: AFSPC/A4A6XX, Mr. Gene Boedigheimer, (719) 554-3319

UNI-Comm Status – Currently in the pre-acquisition stage.  The Uni-Comm program will establish and manage a single AFSPC command-wide communications and IT operations and maintenance contract for core services, providing same or improved level of service for the main operating bases (MOBs) in AFSPC.  This is because of the challenge faced by AFSPC.  Eight of the nine AFSPC Wings have contracted base communications services resulting in:  varying types of service; reduced flexibility in applying new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) because of the many contractual stipulations that must be followed; non-standard performance criteria; and non-standard evaluation of performance. Additionally, the Uni-Comm program will support the single designated approval authority (DAA) concept, prepare for possible integration into the AFNETOPS and Integrated Network Operations and Security Center (I-NOSC) concept, and to the extent possible influence AF/DoD IT policy from our lessons learned. The Uni-Comm program will also provide a means of unity-of-command of the contracted communications and IT efforts in AFSPC in order to follow evaluate and assess compliance with AFSPC-led efforts.  Uni-Comm support will span all of the AFSPC Enterprise Network (AEN), including all Main Operating Bases (MOBs) and select GSUs.

The Uni-Comm Program continues to move forward. Uni-Comm has enjoyed much input from NAFs / Centers / Wings and continues to accept this input, including:

- February – April 2005: Site surveys: Included meetings with Wing Commanders who provided program comments and risks. These inputs were used to initiate Risk Assessment and Risk Mitigation Planning.
- May – July 2005: Senior Level Review Board: Over three meetings the team briefed the program scope, schedule and budget and received approval from Lt Gen Leaf, AFSPC/CV.
- September – November 2005: First Government review of the Statement of Work.
- November 2005 – January 2006: First Industry review of the Statement of Work. 
- January – March 2006: Second Government review of the Statement of Work. 
- March – May 2006: Request for Proposal data collection from the Wings. 

The Uni-Comm Program Management Office has announced its NETCENTS Recommendation

- 11 Jan 2006:  Met with AFPEO/CM, Mr Poussard. One of the topics was our evaluation of NETCENTS as a contract vehicle for this effort. Our evaluation came to the conclusion that NETCENTS did not provide adequately for the program requirements while mitigating sufficient risk. We proposed that either Small Business or Full-and-Open competition be used for this effort. 
- Mr Poussard agreed that that this was a viable way ahead. 
- 1 February 2006. During AFSPC/LC Industry Day, Lt Col Stanko briefed all contractors present that NETCENTS would not be the contracting vehicle used. 
- 50 CONS has published on FedBizOps the fact that NETCENTS contracting vehicle will not be used. All contractor companies are aware of our intent. 

The Uni-Comm Program Management Office is in the process of making a Small Business / Full-and-Open Competition recommendation

- Team is performing a rigorous Market Research evaluation to collect information from Small Business and make a recommendation on their capability to perform this work.
- The team has collected adequate information from Small Business to make this recommendation utilizing this two-month process. The decision is being coordinated through 50 CONS, Legal, and the Small Business Administration. 
- This recommendation will be heard by Mr Poussard during the Acquisition Strategy Panel in late April, a decision is expected at that time and when the decision is released to industry the contractors may perform proper proposal teaming. 

  POCs are as follows:  50 CONS/LGCZW, (719) 567-3831 and Ms. Kathryn Bernstein, Contract Specialist, (719) 567-3441; AFSPC/A6NJ, Lt Col Joseph Stanko, (719) 554-6012; AFSPC/A4A6XX, Mr Gene Boedigheimer, (719) 554-3319

The following paragraphs are excerpts from Air Force and AFSPC policy documents providing the guidance 21 CONS is required to follow for use of the existing contracts. 

The Air Force NETCENTS policy states the NETCENTS contract is the mandatory source for communication capabilities procured to satisfy Air Force Appropriated fund requirements for products and services associated with the design, engineering, integration, installation and configuration of the Air Force Networks and networked infrastructure.  

Since the C4I2TSR contract is a small business set-aside that supports the achievement of Air Force small business goals, it is exempt from the mandatory use policy of NETCENTS and all options can be exercised.  AFSPC has supplemented the Air Force NETCENTS policy stating:

The AF-CIO has mandated NETCENTS as the source for obtaining products and services associated with an integrated project that may include design, engineering, integration, installation and configuration of AFSPC networks and networked infrastructure.  However, the AFSPC Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Information Technology, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4I2TSR) contract is a small business set aside specifically designed for these contract categories and is the preferred AFSPC vehicle for these products/services.  AFSPC organizations shall consider the C4I2TSR contract first; if unable to use this vehicle, organizations are then mandated to use NETCENTS.

The AFSPC CAASETA policy is:

This contract will be the primary provider of all A&AS and E&TA support for HQ AFSPC.  By implementing the CAASETA contract, we will have a single point of contact for all A&AS and E&TA contracts which will help us more effectively use our resources in HQ AFSPC.  To ensure the success of this effort, we have established the CAASETA Program Management Office (PMO), HQ AFSPC/MSZ.  MSZ must be aware of all A&AS and E&TA efforts currently on contract and those being planned, including contracts with any remaining option years.   Effective immediately, no A&AS or E&TA contract actions or modifications will be executed in HQ AFSPC without coordination with the CAASETA PMO.  This includes, but is not limited to, putting efforts or funding on any task orders or contracts with General Services Administration (GSA) contracts, or on a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) of another organization’s contract, or spending any HQ AFSPC TOA  or spending another organization’s or agency’s TOA.   Exemption from the CAASETA contract is by waiver only.  

As of 15 Mar 2006, only two firm requirements have been identified and provided to 21 CONS.  Both of these requirements will be awarded against the existing AFSPC IDIQ contracts.  Even though the existing contracts will be used, there still may be some subcontracting possibilities.  The above contract holder names are provided for reference so those companies not already affiliated with the any of these prime contractors may explore any possible subcontracting opportunities. 

Not all requirements have been fully developed or even identified, so the potential does still exist for additional contractor support.  For those efforts that do not fit any of those existing contracts, 21 CONS will work with AFSPC A4/A6 and A7 to determine an acquisition strategy at the appropriate time:  whether that is a GSA vehicle or some other type of acquisition, full and open, set-aside etc… as appropriate for the circumstances.

Estimated effective date for contract performance is 19 April 2006.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

U. S. COAST GUARD HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET PAINT, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT


1.0	BACKGROUND:

The US Coast Guard (USCG) operates twenty Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  Currently these aircraft are being externally stripped and painted at the Coast Guard’s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center following the completion of a required five year Programmed Depot Maintenance Inspection (PDM).  These aircraft have recently been experiencing paint adhesion discrepancies shortly after delivery to USCG operational units.  Paint adhesion contributes to increased field level maintenance and aircraft corrosion if left untreated.  These discrepancies can be attributed to the limited environmental controls of the paint facility.  In an effort to improve performance, reduce corrosion and field maintenance cost the Coast Guard intends to have one of its HU-25 aircraft commercially painted, for field evaluation.  This RFQ establishes the minimum external paint requirements for this aircraft.
.  





2.0	OBJECTIVE:
            
The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized service center with an onsite paint facility to prepare and externally paint one HU-25 aircraft in accordance with (IAW) commercial practices and the paint manufacturer’s recommended procedures.  Dassault Falcon Jet, Plaisir, France is the OEM.  The general scope of work is as follows:               
            
2.1	Pre-paint surface preparation IAW commercial specifications.  Contractor to identify  
       specifications in the quote.

Note:  Some areas of the aircraft are covered after assembly of the aircraft.  These areas were painted during the interim paint phase of the PDM evolution and will require scuff sanding and feathering so the contractor applied coatings will blend in with USCG coatings previously applied during interim paint as required.  Examples: Flight control surface leading edges, horizontal/vertical stabilizer attachment points, box structures and cavities.  Color match is critical for this contract and future aircraft maintenance (see Attachment 2).  Attachment 2 lists coatings that are currently used by the USCG and are known to provide satisfactory results on USCG aircraft operating in a corrosive environment when properly applied.

2.2	Prime, paint and stencil the aircraft’s exterior surfaces IAW ARSC drawing 925-139, using Stencil/Decal Kit 925-139-1 and the paint manufactures recommended procedures.

2.3	Apply leading edge tape and radome boot IAW ARSC Drawing 925-139.

Aviation coatings which meet or exceed the performance of these materials may be substituted.  If other commercial coatings are suggested, the contractor shall provide paint specifications and sample color chip with their quote.  At a minimum the aircraft shall be primed with a high solid chromated epoxy primer and high solid polyurethane topcoat, however the contractor may quote on other systems (e.g. epoxy primer, filler primer & topcoat).  * Due to space limitations in FedBizOpps, Attachment 2 must be requested.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Contact: RDECOM, CERDEC, Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-BA, Vince Fedorow, email: Vincent.Fedorow@us.army.mil. Description: The purpose of this announcement is to request proposals for a three-month study effort examining system trades and performance predictions for the design of a lightweight multi-function airborne counter CC&D radar. Proposals should be submitt ed against the BAA Solicitation No., W15P7T-04-R-P008, ISR Subtopic 2  Radar Applications, for a 3QFY06 award not to exceed a total of one man-year. Up to three awards are anticipated. Award is not guaranteed and the Government does not intend to pay for information received.   The specific topic of this effort is to establish requirements for the development of a fly-able prototype Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for all-terrain (foliated and open) detection, tracking and imaging of mount ed and dismounted threats in a package form-fit-function compatible with the FCS Class IV UAV system (FIRESCOUT). The following radar system objectives shall serve as the basis of the study.  1) The radar should be capable of penetrating moderate foliage. (Frequency selection to achieve this is critical and should be examined.)  2) The radar should be capable of operating in both SAR and GMTI modes. 3) The GMTI mode should be sufficient to detect mounted (2m²) and dismounted threats (.5m²) to a range of at least 15km in moderate foliage and un-obscured conditions 4) The SAR mode should be sufficient to detect, through automated algorithms, vehicles (2m²) in foliage, arms caches (.5m²) buried up to .5m depth, small metallic objects (.2m²) buried to 4inch depth and all targets under non-occluded conditions to a range  of 15km. 5) The total radar payload (antenna, onboard processor, etc.) should weigh less than 150lbs and consume less than 1.5kW. The study should consider the overall system architecture (SW/HW approach) and include the estimated frequency/polarization(s), operating envelope (range, depression angle and squint limits), cost (development and production), size-weight-power (with compo nent-level estimates), geo-location accuracy, coverage rates, and resolution. Link-budgets shall be included for all predictions. Consideration must also be given to spectrum allocation issues for CONUS and OCONUS operations. Responses to this RFP should be no more than 20 single sided pages of size 10 or 12 font. The responses should describe relevant experience, proposed study approach and personnel qualification to do the study. Vendors without prior experience designing and  developing radar systems at low frequencies (less than 2.0 GHz) will not be considered. Responses are to be received by 10:00 EST, 25 APR 2006. All information must be in writing or via e-mail. You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-BA (Mr. Fedorow) or the following e-mail address: Vincent.Fedorow@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  If you choose to submit proprietary information, mark it accordingly. Classified information will be accepted by mail only, but please mark it accordingly and send it  via proper channels.  Classified information can be sent to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: Security Office.

<DESC>A00002 - Solicitation HSCG38-06-Q-100016 is hereby admended as follows: For clarification and answers to the solicitation.

1.	Date Discrepancy

The solicitation reads:
 
8.1	The contractor shall provide a detailed work scope, delivery schedule and  
       firm fixed price for painting the aircraft.  The aircraft shall be painted and 
       ready for USCG inspection within 14 days from aircraft induction at the 
       contractor’s facility.

Paragraph after 10.0 -Delivery and acceptance of services will be made by United States Coast Guard personnel.  Desired Delivery for CLIN 0001 is 16 days after receipt of aircraft at the paint facility and Required Delivery is 20 days after receipt of aircraft at the paint facility.

Clarification:

The dates are correct.  We want the aircraft painted in 14 days and ready for inspection.  The 16 days is if the USCG delivers early and the aircraft is not indoctrinated immediately.  The 20 days is the latest date of delivery (if any unforseen problems occur to the aircraft-ONLY).

2.	Define Days

Clarificaton:
            Days (as per the Federal Acquisition Register - FAR) is always calendar days                         
            unless otherwise specified (i.e. business days).
    3.  Define Minor Maintenance
         3.3.1 Minor Maintenance: The contractor will perform minor maintenance as  
       required.  This maintenance is limited to removal of exterior panels as required for 
       the purpose of cleaning any residual fluids that may leech from panel cavities.  
       Panels shall be reinstalled IAW the 1U-25A-3 (Structural Repair Manual).  Hardware 
       replacement (e.g. screws, washers, etc) if required shall be of correct type and length 
       IAW 1U-25A-4 (Illustrated Parts Catalog).  The CG liaison will provide maintenance 
       direction.
         Clarification:
         A fuel leak or major hydraulic leak is not normal and is not considered minor maintenance.       
         (Follow procedures in 3.3.3 Major Maintenance)

        Residual hydraulic fluid removal if required is an example of minor maintenance. USCG 
        will try to remove any residual fluids that have accumulated from other maintenance.   
        Sometimes this happens in the lower aft portion of the fuselage.  Normally the USCG has  
        not experienced any problems.

4.   Additional Responsibiltiy

      Can the contractor perform the duties of the USCG as per the following paragragh:

      The Coast Guard will:

3.2.3	Remove the spring fillets, elevator bearing boxes, air deflector and FLIR turret blanking plates upon delivery of the aircraft to the contractor’s facility and will re-install the same upon completion of aircraft painting.  
 
     Clarification:

      The stabilizers can be damaged if the spring fillets are improperly removed.  This  
      work shouldn't take over 2 hours.  If your company has experience in removing

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from a potential offeror.  The questions and answers are as follows:

Regarding the two servers as discussed in the specification:

1.	 (Page 1) Do you want these to be in rackmount cases or standard desktop-type cases? If you want rackmount cases, what is the depth of the rack and is there a limit as to how much space these units can occupy (vertically)? 

The servers should be in rack mounted cases.  The rack is 19” wide and 32” deep.  The entire rack is 72” high. 

2.	(Page 1) What is meant by “A licensed software package to perform network communication control”? 

The network communication control capability provided by Windows operating systems is sufficient.

3.	(Page 1) Do you have a preference for the package used to provide network security?  Are Symantec products acceptable?

Symantec products are acceptable. 

4.	(Page 1) What product or types of product are you referring to when you mention ‘server security’? Microsoft operating systems have security built in.

The security algorithms in the Microsoft operating systems are sufficient. 

5.	(Page 20) “WindowsXP” is listed as the operating system, but page one indicates Windows Server 2003.  I believe the WindowsXP should not be listed, but would prefer not to make any assumptions, so please confirm.

Page 20 is incorrect.  The operating system should be Windows Server 2003 Professional.

6.	Do you want separate DVD and CD burner units or will a combined drive be sufficient?

Combined DVD/CD burner units will be acceptable.

7.	Are there a specific number of available PCI and PCI-E slots you need?  The specification just says “multiple”.

4 PCI and 3 PCI-E slots are required.

8.	Should the hard drives all be removable/hot-swap or can they all be internally mounted?

Hard drives must be removable/hot swap.

Regarding the monitors:

1.	Can you rate these in order of importance: screen size, .25mm pixel pitch, pivot capability, contrast ratio? 

The most critical specifications, in order of importance, are the screen size, the pixel pitch, the pivot capability, and the contrast ratio.  After reviewing this specification, NRL is revising its specification at 3.1.2 (e) to read 0.30 mm pixel pitch.  Offerors are reminded that all of the specifications must be met to be considered technically acceptable.

3.	Do you have a specific brand/model number in mind?  It appears that, once you start looking at the 21” or greater screen sizes, .27mm pixel pitch becomes more common.  Contrast ratio also seems to be a major limiting factor in choices available.

NRL does not have a specific brand or model number in mind. As noted above, NRL is revising its specification at 3.1.2 (e) to read 0.30 mm pixel pitch. Offerors are reminded that all of the specifications must be met.
      
Regarding the UPS units

1.	Do you want the UPS units for the servers/monitors to be in rackmount form factors?

Yes.  The UPS units for the servers/monitors should be in rack mount form factors.

2.	Can the UPS units for the remote data acquisition hardware just be standard desktop PC type UPS units? 

The UPS units for the remote data acquisition system should have a minimum 1500 VA.  Standard desktop PC type UPS units are acceptable.

	1. legally resided in the United States (U.S.);

	3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S.  The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm.

By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)

Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
	•	High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
	•	Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
	•	Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required;3 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
	If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required;5 and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered “long-term” and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, “intermittent” is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

NOTES:

1 FIPS 201 is available at:  www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf

2 Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer.  The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge.  The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.

3 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

4 In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM.  Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block  " B "  of the  " Agency Use Only "  section of the investigative form.  This report is available for all case types.

5 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

(b)	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to apprise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.

Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.

(e)	When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

(f)	Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.
