<DESC>The Department of the Interior, GovWorks (DOI/GovWorks) intends to award a sole source fixed-price contract to the New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE) under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/Office of Minority Health (DHHS/OMH). DOI/GovWorks intends to issue a sole source contract under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-3 (a) (ii).  This is a contract by negotiation using FAR Part 15.  The purpose of this contract is to conduct a feasibility study for creating a Multi-Tribal College in New England to better address the higher education needs of federally recognized tribes and Urban Indian centers in the region consisting of: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.  This project shall determine the viability of such an institution and the possible forms it might take.  This study should address logistical issues prior to moving forward into a planning and development phase.  This study should document the available resources and leading community needs; the economic and educational viability of such a project; the cost-benefits analysis of different Tribal College configurations (e.g. core campus, satellite campuses, and distance learning programs), address questions of governance, sustainability, and even location.  Responses will be evaluated based upon the contractor's experience and expertise in working on the following projects:  1. The Regional Student Program (RSP), 2. Connection: The Journal of the New England Board of Higher Education, 3. The Excellence through Diversity (ETD), and 4. The New England Technology Education Partnership.  Today, each New England state is represented on the New England Board of Higher Education by eight delegates -- leaders of education, business and government who are appointed by their states' governors and legislative leadership. Who are supported by a staff of dedicated professionals who work closely with public and private partners throughout the six-state region.  Against a backdrop of deep economic uncertainty and exploding college enrollments fueled by the G.I. Bill, the Governors of the listed states formed the NEBHE and committed their states to the shared pursuit of excellence. Soon after that, NEBHE was approved by New England's six state legislatures and authorized by the U.S. Congress.  Based on the NEBHE's comprehensive work experience in the areas of diversity, research, education, curriculum development and their Native American participation on their board, they are uniquely suited and qualified to undertake this contract.  This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received within fifteen (15) days of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action is based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. POC: DOI/GovWorks; Attention: Mat Ridolfi, 381 Elden Street-MS2510, Herndon, VA 20170. All questions should be emailed to mat.ridolfi@mms.gov and MUST reference RFP number 34184.

<DESC>This program envisions the development of robust materials systems design processes driven by product requirements. Strategies developed will employ generic techniques for coupling calculations and measurements of thermodynamic, structural and kinetic properties of materials with models of microstructural entities that determine macroscopic behavior. Models will employ concepts that link microscale and mesoscale models with continuum descriptions of material behavior and techniques that employ these descriptions to calculate properties of materials and integrate the results into engineering design software. Uncertainty modeling leading to lifetime prediction and assessment models must be an integral part of this development. Modeling at all levels must be accompanied by critical experiments designed to verify analytical predictions and techniques for estimating the reliability and scatter of the computed properties. Emphasis throughout will be on the reduction of empiricism and ad hoc assumptions and the compatibility of each model with those for adjacent length and time scales. Principal goals of this effort are to develop improved design methodologies for structural materials and manufacturing processes by combining experimental and modeling tools from the atomic scale, through the meso scale, and up to the system scale while simultaneously controlling or predicting material reliability issues related to performance. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Office of the Clerk needs to enhance its existing Lobby Disclosure (LD) system by allowing lobbyists to sign Lobby Disclosure registration forms electronically with a digital signature that is verified using the GSA-Sponsored Certificate Arbitrator Module (CAM) software and submit the forms electronically. The digital signatures will be verified using CAM software installed and maintained locally on a server within the Office of the Clerk's server farm or by CAM software remotely accessed through the GSA-sponsored E-Authentication portal. The Office of the Clerk may decide to use the E-Authentication portal as the primary means of verification and a locally configured CAM as a backup. The Contractor must be prepared to integrate the LD system with a locally installed and maintained CAM or a remotely installed CAM that verifies digital signatures through the E-Authentication portal, or both.  In addition, the Office of the Clerk needs to automate the updating of the databases in the LD system electronically with information contained on the submitted forms.  The LD system contains two (2) databases:
 (1) a database containing PDF files representing the electronic forms and (2) Microsoft SQL tables containing information contained on the submitted forms. The records in the Lobby Disclosure Act (LDA) databases must be electronically created or updated with both the PDF files and the information contained on each electronically submitted form.  The documents' database needs to be updated with a PDF file for each LD form electronically submitted therefore eliminating the need to scan LD forms that are filed electronically.  The SQL database also needs to be updated with the information contained on the forms to eliminate manual data entry of this information. The current system is paper-based, thus requiring handwritten signatures, manual data entry into the LD SQL database, and manual scanning of the paper documents into the LD documents' database.  The option to submit paper forms will remain available. 

Because lobbyists could begin filing their LD forms for the second half of 2004 as early as January 1, 2005, the Contractor awarded this contract must complete this entire effort by Friday, December 17, 2004. The entire effort must include complete user testing and House acceptance.

The Office of the Clerk is responsible for receiving and tracking documents submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives under the Lobby Disclosure Act of 1995 (Public law 104-65). This law requires the disclosure of certain information related to lobbying activities and financial information. The Lobby Disclosure Act of 1995 requires lobbyists to register and provide semi-annual lobbying reports to the Clerk's office.  The registration form and instructions are available at http://clerk.house.gov/pd/index.php and in Section J of the RFP. 

The Office of the Clerk's system currently provides forms to be completed electronically using PDF files. Once completed, the forms must be printed and either mailed or delivered in person to the Legislative Resource Center (LRC) within the Office of the Clerk. 

Within the Office of the Clerk, the LRC serves as the repository for the lobbying forms received by the Clerk's office. It is the responsibility of the LRC to maintain records regarding these filings, identify and notify filers of their responsibilities, track filers' submissions, and make the submissions available for onsite public viewing.  In this regard, the LRC uses electronic means for making LD records available for viewing by the public.  The submitted documents are scanned as PDF files and the public can search the SQL database for metadata queries at public workstations in the Cannon House Office Building, Room B-106. 

The U.S. House of Representatives needs to integrate the use of digital signatures and electronic submission of the required registration forms with the existing Lobby Disclosure (LD) system. The U.S. House of Representatives requires Contractor support to enhance existing PDF forms to include the capability of signing the forms with a digital signature that is verified using the GSA-sponsored CAM, establish a mechanism for the submission of the forms electronically, further enhance field validation within the PDF form, refine LD system requirements, create a design document for LD system enhancements, and integrate the electronically-submitted forms and information derived from those forms into the current LD system.  Integration of the electronically-submitted forms means that PDF renditions of the form for each electronic filer must be added to the document database of the LD system.  Integration of the information derived from the forms means that the data entered into the form must be captured and stored in the LD SQL database.  There is additional data entered into the electronic form that is not currently captured in the LD database.  The additional fields must be added to the LD SQL database as part of this effort. The Contractor will also need to provide user and technical documentation for all work performed and also provide training to House personnel (LRC Records and Registration staff for user training and LCS technical staff for technical training).  The user training must include how to use the system.  The technical training must include complete code reviews and how to support the new functionality.

The Contractor must become familiar with the current Lobby Disclosure system through review of the associated legislation (Public Law 104-65) as well as a review of the associated forms and documents (Appendices).    Review of House documentation includes but is not limited to the following:

	*	Public Law 104-65 (Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995).
	*	Lobbying Registration form (LD-1).
	*	Lobbying Report form (LD-2).
	*	Report on Alternative Methods for Authenticated Electronic Submission of the Lobby Disclosure Forms
	*	Report on Using Digital Signature with Outsourced Certificates for Submitting Lobby Disclosure Forms.

A review of the House Inspector General's report entitled Legislative Information Systems Evaluation (Report No. 99-CLK-02) may also be helpful. This report can be found at http://www.house.gov/IG/99clk02/report.htm.

The House will provide access to technical and functional legislative staff for answering questions on this project. 

All work (including reviews, evaluations, and analyses) must be guided by established Federal and private industry criteria.  All written work products shall utilize proper business grammar and formatting techniques.   The design for LD enhancements must use a risk-oriented approach and must ensure that the recommendations meet the needs and the standards of the House in the most efficient, effective, and economical manner.

This contract will consist of two (2) tasks.
 
Task 1 will include integrating the use of digital signatures that are verified using the GSA-sponsored CAM Software, implementation of the capability to submit electronic LD forms with digital signatures and agreed upon field validation, and simultaneously creating a design document that describes and refines LD system requirements including:


(1) additional validation of the existing LD form fields, 
(2) processes for the acceptance and verification of the authenticity of the submitted forms, 
(3) all necessary implementation requirements for the LD system to store the electronically submitted forms and the data extracted from those forms.
 
Task 2 will consist of implementing the processes defined within the design document from Task 1.

The Contractor shall discuss and clarify task order requirements and deliverables, and the Contractor must present a work plan at a kick-off meeting for this Contract.

C.1 Task 1 - Refinement of Requirements, Defining Data Capture Fields, Design Document, addition of Digital Signature, and Implementation of Electronic Submission.

C.1.1 Refinement of Requirements, Defining Data Capture Fields, and Design Document.

The Contractor will become familiar with the current House Lobby Disclosure system, applicable laws, and the current procedures used by reviewing the system, House documentation of the system, and interviewing House personnel. The Contractor will specifically work with House personnel from LRC to determine the validation needed to be added to the LD PDF forms and the information to be captured from the electronically submitted forms. 

The Contractor will inventory the existing network infrastructure that exists within the Office of the Clerk's Server Farm and determine if the existing configuration (hardware and software) associated with the current LD system is sufficient to handle the additional requirements. Staff personnel from Legislative Computer Systems (LCS) within the Office of the Clerk will be available to answer questions about current and future systems architecture. If the current LD system is lacking the needed capacity, the Contractor will advise the House as to what additional hardware and software needs will be required and the Office of the Clerk will acquire the additional resources. The Contractor may be asked to assist with the installation of some of the recommended products. 

The data capture and updating of the LD system and databases will not be implemented during this task. However, the Contractor will provide a design document outlining how they will integrate all of the agreed upon enhancements into the existing LD system. The design document must include the methodology, actions, and timeline necessary to enhance the LD system with all of the following mandatory requirements:
 
	*	Validation of the LD forms - The validation agreed upon with LRC.
	*	Digital Signature - Digital Signature must be included on the LD forms.
	*	Electronic Submission - The ability to electronically submit verifiable LD forms in a secure and nonrepudiated manner.
	*	Digital Signature Verification - The digital signature must provide the following mandatory requirements:
	*	Data confidentiality in transit - Protect data from disclosure during the submission process.
		*	Data integrity in transit - do not allow data to be changed during submission without detection.
		*	Technical nonrepudiation - Use cryptographic methods to demonstrate that a submission was 	
			signed by a unique private key associated with a specific person or process.				  
	*	Updating the LD documents database - The LD documents database must be electronically updated (in PDF format) 
		upon receipt of LD forms with a verified digital signature, therefore eliminating the need to manually scan the 
		documents.
	*	Updating the LD SQL database - The LD SQL database must be electronically updated with the information that is currently being captured in the existing system upon receipt of LD forms that contain a verified digital signature, therefore eliminating the need to manually enter the information submitted electronically. 
	*	Capture of additional information from the LD forms - There is additional data entered into the electronic form that is not currently captured in the LD SQL database.  The additional fields will need to be added to the LD SQL database as part of this effort and those fields will need to be harvested from the LD forms that contain a verified digital signature.

The House must approve the final design document before the Contractor begins Task 2.

C.1.2	Modification of Electronic Lobby Disclosure Forms to Include Digital Signature, Form Validation, and Electronic Submission.

The Contractor will modify the existing House LD PDF forms to allow the addition of a digital signature to include the appropriate verification/validation using the GSA-sponsored CAM software. In addition, the LD PDF forms must be modified to include the validation defined and agreed to between the House staff (LRC) and the Contractor per the design document. At the conclusion of this task, the mechanism to enable lobbyists wishing to file LD forms electronically with the House must be installed, tested, and fully implemented. 

The process enabling lobbyists to file electronically must include the following mandatory requirements:    

	*	Digital signature - All LD forms filed electronically must be signed with a digital signature verified using the GSA-sponsored CAM software.
	*	Electronic form submission capability - Provide a method for lobbyists to electronically submit LD forms.
	*	Validation of the LD forms - The LD forms must include the validation specified and agreed to during the requirements refinement portion of this task. 

C.2 Task 2 - Implementation of Data Capture, Updating of Databases, Documentation, User Acceptance Testing, and Training. 

C.2.1 Data Capture and Updating of Databases.

Based upon the approved design document, the Contractor will modify the LD system to integrate the electronically-submitted forms and information derived from those forms into the current LD system.  Integration of the electronically-submitted forms means that PDF renditions of the form for each electronic filer must be added to the documents' database of the LD system.  Integration of the information derived from the forms means that the data entered into the form must be captured and stored in the LD SQL database.  There is additional data entered into the electronic form that is not currently captured in the LD database.  The additional fields must be added to the LD SQL database as part of this effort and these fields must be populated by the data extracted from the electronic forms that have verified digital signatures.

 The data capturing enhancements will include the following:

	*	Updating the LD documents database - The LD documents database must be electronically updated (in PDF format)
upon submission, verification, and acceptance of the electronically submitted LD forms, therefore eliminating the need to scan electronically submitted PDF forms.
	*	Updating the LD SQL database - Upon submission, verification, and acceptance of the electronically submitted LD forms, the LD SQL database must be electronically updated with the information that is currently being captured in the existing system, therefore eliminating the need to manually enter the information submitted electronically. 
	*	Capture of additional information from the LD forms - There is additional data entered into the electronic form that is not currently captured in the LD database.  The additional fields will need to be added to the LD SQL database as part of this effort.

C.2.2 User Documentation/ Training of House Support Staff/ User Acceptance Testing. 

The Contractor will provide the LRC Records and Registration staff with a manual describing the enhanced features of the LD system and step by step operational instructions on how to implement the new features. 

The Contractor shall train the House LRC Records and Registration staff in the newly created electronic submission process. This will familiarize Records and Registration staff with the use of digital signatures and electronic forms submissions. After training, their level of proficiency needs to be at a level to answer questions related to the electronic LD forms submission process. The Records and Registration staff must also be capable of instructing registrants on how to contact a designated CA for certificate issuance. In addition, the Contractor will provide the Records and Registration staff with a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to help them respond to inquiries once the system is implemented.

A test environment will be created to fully test the new features of the enhanced system. The Contractor will provide information to the LCS staff describing what resources (hardware/software) are needed to create the test environment. If additional resources are needed, LCS will secure and install the needed resources. The Contractor will work with LCS staff to create the test environment.

The Contractor needs to provide the ability to enable the House to create test forms for submission and fully process the forms within the test environment. During this task, the Records and Registration staff will perform detailed testing of the newly enhanced system in the test environment. Test scripts and scenarios will be provided by the Contractor.

The Contractor will also provide technical documentation describing the new features and also provide training to House LCS technical staff. The technical training must include complete code reviews and how to support the new functionality.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number is DSSIP04072001.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Acquisition of Commercial Items; (FAC 21); 26 March 2004.   This solicitation is a 100% small business set aside, and the NAICS code is 541611, size standard is $6.0M.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. The contract line item is CLIN 0001:  The contractor shall furnish materials and supplies to perform the work specified in the specific tasks listed in C.3 through C.6. The Government does not intend to provide any material support (e.g. office space, computers, paper, etc) for this requirement.

C.1  BACKGROUND:

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) provides logistical support for the entire Department of Defense.   The infrastructure used to conduct this mission varies widely from highly specialized petroleum facilities to standard administrative and warehouse facilities.  The policy document that currently governs the Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization program for all DLA facilities is DLAM 4270.1, the DLA Facilities Projects Manual. The current Facilities Project Manual is outdated and in need of conversion to the One-Book format.  The organic DSS staff does not have sufficient manpower to research and reformat the current Facilities Project Manual in the timeframe mandated for updating all existing DLA policy manuals.  Since the policy promulgated by this manual directly impacts facilities essential to the performance of the Agency’s mission, and involves annual budgets of approximately $300 million, it is essential that the required research and conversion be as complete, accurate and clear  as possible.  

C.2  OBJECTIVE:

Update the current DLA Facility Project Manual into the One-Book Format.  The new policy document will encompass only the SRM Program processes. The processes for Non-ADP Capital Equipment, MILCON, Military Family Housing and PDW will be addressed in other One-Book documents which can be referenced as appropriate. One-Book process flowcharts and text must be entirely consistent with the current real property policies and the SRM automated systems. All appropriate technical documents are to be incorporated by reference (e.g. United States Code cites, DoD Directives and Instructions, DoD Financial Management Regulation, DoD Unified Facilities Criteria 3-600-01 Fire Protection, SRM Project Application User’s manual, DD1391 Preparation Guidance, etc).

C.3  SCOPE:

The SRM Project management process shall include all policies and all manual (i.e. project checklists, building project folders) and automated methods (i.e.  SRM Project Application, Facility Management System Application, email) to accomplish the following:  Planning    Identification and documentation of the facility deficiency or requirement including the scope, justification, host and customer data, location, facility, major component and condition data.                          
Programming    Development of project design and construction costs, work classification, priorities, execution plans, and SRM program budget requirements by business management area.        
Design    Identification and tracking of design support activities, milestones/events, and costs necessary to prepare a facility project for construction contract solicitation/negotiation and award.
Funding    Capture and tracking of funding document information, by project, including commitments, acceptances, obligations, contract/delivery order awards, and contract modifications for both design and construction.
Contracting    Capture and tracking of contracting events and documents, including actual contract and  modification award amounts and dates. 
Construction    Capture and reporting of contract execution data from notice to proceed (NTP) through beneficial occupancy and closeout.

C.4  SPECIFIC TASKS:  

C.4.1  Reformat/Update the current DLA Facility Project Manual, DLAM 4270.1 into the DLA One-Book Format as specified and described in the current DLA One-Book Chapter Sample Process and Style Guide, Flowchart Symbols, and associated documents on the DLA One-Book webpage (http://www.dla.mil/onebook).

The United States Coast Guard is seeking information from industry that will assist in the market research and alternatives analysis phase of the Integrated Aids to Navigation (ATON) System capability replacement project.  This is a new acquisition project which addresses the capability gap in existence due to the advanced age and poor material condition of the existing coastal and inland Aids to Navigation fleet.  The project is looking at both a one for one replacement or renovation of 164 cutters and boats that span 11 different classes, as well as a systematic approach to replacing the existing capability with a different asset mix.  The attachment to this RFI further defines the existing system, requirements, sample response outline.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: (a) Candidate craft currently in use to replace operational capability inherent in the current fleet of assets.  Note that the current platforms may not necessarily be replaced one-for-one, and efficiencies may be sought to reduce the number of asset classes as well as operating cost. (b) In use equipment that may provide a portable capability to be transferred between assets to address specific operational requirements, for example, pile driving. (c) Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.)(d) General availability of such equipment and platforms. (e) Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing the Integrated ATON System.   

The Coast Guard may hold an Information Exchange meeting or individual meetings with potential respondents to discuss this RFI.  If you are interested in attending an Information Exchange meeting or a one on one meeting, please respond to the Contracting Officer.  If an Information Exchange meeting is held, the date, time, and place will be posted in the FedBizOps.  

As stated above, this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<CONTACT>Wade Wargo, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-2574, Email wargow@onr.navy.mil - Vera Carroll, Branch Head ONR Code 253, Phone 703-696-2610, Email carrolv@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is the lead organization for development efforts being initiated under the Fleet/Force Protection (F/FP) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program.  One such technology project headed by ONR under the F/FP FNC is the Advanced Multi Function Radio Frequency Concept (AMRFC).   AMRFC is a program that addresses the increasing challenges of shipboard topside Radio Frequency (RF) functions. Specifically, AMRFC is developing and demonstrating technology for Electronic Warfare (EW), Radar, and RF Communications functions sharing common receive and transmit antennas.

Current U.S. Navy surface combatants employ a large number of RF apertures (antennas) to enable Electronic Warfare, Communication, and Radar functions.  Historically, each function (and hence system) has its own aperture, electronics, operator, and logistics/maintenance tail. This classic RF systems approach results in Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC) issues which degrade system performance and increase life-cycle cost for the combatant.  Ship RF signature and radar cross section is difficult to reduce when restricted to classic RF aperture/antenna approaches. Additionally, future shipboard radars (Multi-Function Radar (MFR), Volume Surveillance Radar (VSR)) require more power and higher duty cycles which further compound EMI problems. 

The Navy’s identified need for improved platform signature control; reduced manning; reduced platform cross-section; and scalable, affordable, open systems architectures and technologies for future combatant antennas/apertures are the major drivers behind ONR’s AMRFC research efforts.

In order to address the issues of ship signature, physical size and weight constraints, performance, and life cycle cost; ONR has sponsored research for new electronics components, RF apertures, and system capabilities using broadband, multifunction, RF designs and advanced technologies.  The F/FP FNC program at ONR, through the AMRFC project and AMRFC test bed deployed at the Naval Research Laboratory’s (NRL) Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) site in Maryland, is developing the capability to integrate and demonstrate Radar, Electronic Warfare, Communications, and Aviation support functions into a common set of RF apertures. The test bed system is capable of generating multiple simultaneous beams performing multiple RF functions where the functionality is defined by software. ONR and the F/FP FNC is currently demonstrating this technology within the test bed at CBD.  AMRFC will reduce the acquisition cost risk of transitioning multi function RF technology to Navy surface combatants (DD(X), CVN-21) by demonstrating the functions of High Probability of Intercept (HPOI), Precision Direction Finding (PDF), High Gain/High Sensitivity (HG/HS) Electronic Warfare Support (ES), Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) of received signals, Electronic Attack (EA), Common Data Link (CDL) and Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL).

This notice is to announce ONR’s intent to release a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the development, testing, and demonstration of a Multi Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) Electronic Warfare Support (ES) system for the DD(X) program.  MFEW (ES) is the designated title for specific follow-on work to transition multi function Electronic Warfare enabling technology previously performed under the AMRFC project initially identified as AMRFC/EW. This work specifically addresses the Electronic Warfare/Electronic Support (surveillance) requirements for the DD(X) and potentially other future U.S. Navy surface ship requirements. The ensuing awards from this RFP are intended to provide for the Technology Development (TD) and Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) phases of a Navy acquisition program.  The program will develop and demonstrate a proof of concept ES prototype.  The ES prototype will be a low observable multi function RF array antenna system.  It will demonstrate key performance capabilities and perform technology risk mitigation.  The proof of concept demonstration will be conducted in an at-sea environment representative of environmental conditions to be faced by shipboard installed systems.  MFEW (ES) will be integrated with other systems to be installed on the DD(X).  The initial effort will thus demonstrate the integration of the MFEW (ES) system with the ship’s combat, navigation, environment control via applicable Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) hardware and software.

The MFEW (ES) top-level technical objectives are contained in the AMRFC/EW Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) dated December 2003, and classified “SECRET”.  The initial EW capabilities required for MFEW (ES) will include HPOI, PDF and HG/HS. The system will demonstrate and perform passive detection; angle of arrival (AOA) determination; classification of threat, neutral and friendly emitters; and targeting of terminal seekers. The required ES capability sensitivity shall enable extended decision timelines by providing information that helps clear the tactical picture to support EW engagements at extended ranges.  The objective of the TD Phase is to demonstrate MFEW (ES) technology that provides the critical components for the development and deployment of an ES system that meets key operational and technical objectives.  Unit cost, platform integration and supportability are essential elements that will be continually assessed to conform to DD(X) requirements.  This ES capability will be an integrated element with the DD(X) combat system contributing to both DD(X) operations as well as operations with the battle group.  The ES capability to be demonstrated will contribute to own ships and battle group interoperability.

Initial efforts of the MFEW (ES) program include traceability of requirements from top-level DD(X) requirements to support ES requirements definition, trade studies, top-level system and subsystem designs. Threat analysis will be conducted and ES specifications will be developed that support DD(X) missions.  Threat, ES parameters and DD(X) integration and RCS requirements will be evaluated and requirements allocated to establish ES system architecture and critical multi function component/module specifications.  Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) will be a continuing task during all phases to assure an affordable open systems design is achieved. AMRFC developed technologies and results of testing will be evaluated to assess conformance with DD(X) EW performance requirements. AMRFC hardware and software components/modules will be evaluated and incorporated into the MFEW (ES) system design when their performance is evaluated and assessed to meet DD(X) EW requirements while also providing the most cost effective solution for specific MFEW (ES) functions. Analyses of existing SEWIP development efforts will be conducted in order to exploit existing capabilities that reduce risk as well as meet cost objectives and design requirements. Ongoing Science and Technology efforts such as ManTech and SBIR efforts will likewise be evaluated for potential transitions and applications to this development effort.

This RFP will provide for multiple awards of Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts.  Multiple contract and task order awards are anticipated based on major systems and component level procurements supporting the planned technology and systems demonstration. This may include multiple task order awards per task order solicitation. Sample tasks representative of the major deliverables that are anticipated to be procured via separate task orders under the multiple award contracts will be included within the RFP.  Offeror’s abilities to perform under the contract will be evaluated based on sample task proposals as well as additional criteria identified within the RFP. Offerors must show reasonable ability to perform the work under a sample task to be eligible for basic contract award.  The sample task proposals are for evaluation purposes only and will not be used to issue any initial task order awards.  The first task order solicitation is intended to be issued immediately after award of the basic contracts from this RFP. The anticipated basic contract award date is September 2004.  The contract will have a five-year ordering period.

The blanket Statement of Work under any ensuing basic contracts from this RFP will include the following types of tasks: requirements definition, trade studies, system and subsystem designs, threat analysis, development, fabrication, system integration, test, demonstration, production engineering, preparation of production documentation and qualification testing, and production and testing of limited quantities of system/subsystems, i.e., Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP), for the DD(X) platform.  The ensuing IDIQ contracts will allow for the issuance of orders by ONR and by PEO IWS 2.  ONR anticipates that the basic contract will have a maximum ordering ceiling of $200M.

It is anticipated that ONR will issue a Draft RFP on the ONR website at http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/rfps/n00014_04_r_0012/ on approximately 16 APR 2004.   Industry’s comments to the Draft RFP should be provided by email (wargow@onr.navy.mil) to the ONR Contracting Officer on or before 30 APR 2004.   A final RFP is anticipated to be issued on approximately 03 MAY 2004.  No hardcopies of this RFP will be mailed, faxed, or emailed.  In order to submit a proposal under this solicitation, Offerors must possess a SECRET facility clearance with SECRET safeguarding.  The RFP will be unclassified, but the technical objectives in the TTA are classified “SECRET” and therefore will be provided under separate cover.  The TTA will only be provided to interested Offerors who have a SECRET facility clearance with SECRET safeguarding.  The TTA will be mailed in hardcopy or on CD ROM to Offerors upon request via the following methods: Mail to Office of Naval Research, Ballston Centre Tower One, Attn: Wade Wargo, ONR 0251, 800 N. Quincy Street, Rm. 720, Arlington, VA, 22217-5660; Email to wargow@onr.navy.mil; or Fax to 703-696-0066.  All requests should include RFP Number, Company Cage Code, Facility address, and Request Point of Contact information.  Requests for the TTA can be sent immediately after publication of this synopsis.  After award of the basic contracts from this solicitation, additional task order solicitations may be submitted that include System Requirements Documents (SRDs) and/or other requirements documents classified at the “Secret” level.

<DESC>The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) intends to award a sole source contract to Southeast Agnet Radio Network for a base year, and four additional option years. This firm will design, produce, and implement a 3 State regional publicity campaign to promote specific USDA Ag Statistics program activities. This will involve a series of repetitive network radio station announcements during regularly scheduled farm and ranch news programs. The announcements will air between July 2004 and June 2005 throughout Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The campaign should include a minimum of 200 (combination of 30-second and 60-second) network announcements, for 12 months, which equals approximately 12, 200 individual radio station announcements.

 Background. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is the primary collector of U.S. agricultural data and publishes official statistics as authorized by the United States Department of Agriculture, (USDA). NASS serves the basic agricultural and rural data needs of the country with accurate, timely, and unbiased statistical information and services to the public. The primary sources of data for NASS reports are information provided by farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses. NASS relies on the voluntary cooperation of respondents to report data. Data reported by respondents is confidential and protected from disclosure by federal statute. 

NASS has 46 field offices (called State Statistical Offices (SSOs), each headed by a State Statistician), servicing all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Data collection is conducted by mail out and mail back of report forms. 

NASS has two primary target audiences for Publicity efforts:1) Data Providers – Much of our current publicity and promotion work is directed toward data providers. Data Users – May include Government and academia, agricultural communicators (print, broadcast, and television), agricultural analysts, agricultural producer groups (e.g. the Farm Bureau, the Corngrowers Association, National Pork Producers Council, etc., and agribusinesses who supply, buy from, or support agricultural production. 

Purpose. The purpose of the campaign is to increase awareness of NASS surveys and how they positively impact agricultural producers. 

Goals:The goals of the 3-State regional publicity campaign are: 1) To convince farmers and ranchers to respond to surveys conducted by NASS/USDA, 2) To raise the level of name recognition of the NASS, and create positive associations with the data it collects and disseminates. 3) Ownership and Confidentiality. NASS shall retain the copyright of any published work, including original photography and illustration, if required. All information received by any contractor in the course of working with the NASS is considered confidential, and remains the property of NASS. 

 Please e-mail your brief technical proposal (3 pages or less) and your cost proposal for the base year and four option years to lfischer@ars.usda.gov, or you can fax them to (202) 720-3987 by April 16, 2004. Note that e-mail responses are preferred.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is NOI-RML-40009.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix for 2 lot of custom probe arrays, at 90 chips per lot.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-21 dated 03/26/04. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 and the small business size is 500 employees. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) performs research on multiple, diverse human bacterial pathogens and the host/bacterial response during infection. The LHBP has purchased a custom designed, multi-genome GeneChip probe array specific to RML needs, containing the following bacterial genomes: Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia pestis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Coxiella burnettii and Chlamydia trachomatis.  This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other known chip of its kind exists. The RML custom chip contains twenty-one (21) different bacterial genomes condensed into six (6) different genuses of pathogenic bacteria. These gene chips will be used in RML experiments to analyze the bacterial response during host infection. The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305). The chip is high density.  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. The chips processed by NIAID are in Frederick, MD where the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database are located. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix is compatible with the Affymetrix system currently in place in Frederick, MD.  In addition, there is no photolithography-based chip processing system on site at RML.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; FAR 52-212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items; FAR52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The goal of this six-month-long project is to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the Armenian Potable Water and Sewage Company (APWSC).   The objective of the audit is to enable the auditor to express an opinion on the financial statements of the APWSC insofar as they are prepared in accordance with the International Accounting Standards (IAS) as published by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC).  The financial statements comprise the balance sheet as of December 31 for the calendar years 2002 and 2003 and the related statements of income and cash flows for those years. 

Under IAS 1, a complete set of financial statements includes the following components:
(a)	Balance sheet;
(b)	Income statement;
(c)	A statement showing either: (i) all changes in equity; or (ii) changes in equity other than those arising from capital transactions with owners and distributions to owners;
(d)	Cash flow statement; and
(e)	Accounting policies and explanatory notes.
IAS 27 requires that consolidated financial statements should be prepared where a parent has subsidiaries.    The APWSC’s accounting records provide the basis for preparation of the financial statements and were established to reflect the financial transactions in respect of the APWSC.

<DESC>SURVIVING BLOOD LOSS, SOL BAA04-12, Addendum 3, DUE 062104, POC: DR. JOSEPH BIELITZKI, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (703) 696-5278,. Email: baa04-12@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/. The Defense Sciences Office is interested in innovative proposals to develop the science and technology necessary to reduce fatalities associated with traumatic injury and blood loss. The vision for the Surviving Blood Loss (SBL) Program is to develop novel strategies that delay the onset of irreversible shock and allow an injured warfighter to survive with significantly reduced oxygen delivery for extended periods of time, thus providing increased time for evacuation, triage, and initiation of supportive therapies. This will be an extremely aggressive, milestone driven program with a (24 month) Phase 1 effort that will culminate in the demonstration of at least 75% survival in a rodent model of controlled hemorrhagic shock, in which 60% of the estimated blood volume is removed and the animal is maintained for 3 hours prior to crystalloid resuscitation. Based on the successful completion of Phase 1, the Phase 2 program will demonstrate 75% survival after 6 hours of hemorrhagic shock (as described above), as well as the demonstration of equivalent effects in a second experimental model. To accomplish this Phase 1 effort, it is expected that interdisciplinary teams will be required to develop an understanding of the control mechanisms of energy production, metabolism, and oxygen utilization and then identify and control the protective mechanisms that preserve cellular function despite critically depressed oxygen delivery. Specific technical challenges may include: 1) understanding how cellular metabolism can be modified to match oxygen and substrate supply; 2) determining whether alternative electron acceptors may be used to prevent oxidative damage; 3) determining whether metabolic states may be switched on demand;  4) elucidating the physiological mechanisms in naturally occurring animal models of hypometabolic states 4) identifying protective preconditioning strategies; 5) clarifying the basis of evolutionary adaptations in species that survive temporary adverse environments through metabolic control (e.g., cold, oxygen depletion, famine, estavation/hibernation, diving);  6) providing rapid, complete restoration of normal physiological activity following an induced systemic metabolic stasis; and/or 7) showing that these mechanisms may be applied to humans at the level of the organ and/or organism in order to develop an integrated approach to improve stability following injury and/or blood loss.  Proposals responding to this BAA should describe a 24-month Phase 1 effort focused on achieving a Phase 1 milestone described above. It is suggested that teams be proposed that can address the technical challenges described above and integrate them into a single proposal. Consideration will be given to proposals that attack one or more of those challenges in the absence of an integrated team provided they are willing to be integrated with another team that has accepted the challenge of meeting the specific milestone. Phase 2 proposals will be requested at a later date. Proposers should clearly indicate how their Phase 1 deliverables and milestones will transition into Phase 2 activities. TEAMING. Progress in the SBL program will depend on the formation of well-managed interdisciplinary efforts that draw on expertise from such areas as metabolic physiology, energetics, nutrition, endocrinology, muscle physiology, mitochondrial physiology, hibernation, immunology, biochemistry, hemorrhagic shock, and cellular biology. In addition, it is expected that a strong mathematics and/or computer modeling component will be included where necessary. Members of interdisciplinary teams will be required to work collaboratively and collectively maintain sharp focus toward achieving the Phase 1 objectives. Submission of White Papers: We invite white papers (10 pages or less) in response to this announcement. The white paper should be organized as follows: 1) An Executive Summary. 2) The idea. Which area(s) of emphasis are you addressing? 3) The approach. How will you address these areas? Briefly define the research plan you intend to follow. What are the research challenges, and how will they be addressed? What is unique or revolutionary about your approach? What additional capabilities do you envision will be enabled by your ideas? How do you plan to demonstrate the success of the research effort within the 24-month period of funding? Every white paper must describe specific, quantitative milestone(s) that need to be achieved in order to demonstrate progress in reaching the ultimate goals of the program. 4) The cost. What is your cost estimate for resources required for the proposed time line? 5) The Management Plan. A brief description of the technical expertise of the principal investigator and the key team members must be provided, along with a management plan describing how different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated to ultimately generate a proof-of-concept to be completed within 24 months. White papers sent in response to this addendum are due at DARPA no later than 1600 hours ET, May 3, 2004. Proposers submitting white papers will be notified within 15 business days of that date if a full proposal will be requested. To facilitate the submission process, a website has been established, http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/. Not withstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goal, 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths, and 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects. Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically, and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program.  Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, bidder teaming is highly encouraged. Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 24 months, but consideration should be given to possible continuation of the effort into Phase 2. If proposals include use of Government facilities, offerors will be expected to conclude commercial services arrangements with the providing Government facility. If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements. Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal. The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds. Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost. The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 04-12 of February 2, 2004. To receive consideration under this addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT DARPA NO LATER THAN 1600 ET JUNE 21, 2004, at the address shown below. Proposals received after that date, will be considered under the open BAA only. A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/ has been established to facilitate the submission of full proposals electronically. This site will allow the filling in of contact information and the uploading of a full proposal created with the requirements listed in this addendum and in accordance with the original BAA04-12 published.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for supplemental fishery observer services.  The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples.  Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation.  This data, which cannot be obtained either dockside or while aboard Government research vessels, is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from New York to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in cramped quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities.  Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals.  Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The Government anticipates award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type of contract with a period of performance of one year.  The anticipated issue date for the solicitation is March 15, 2004 with a closing date on or about April 2, 2004. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency. Neither telephone requests nor inquiries will be accepted in response to this notice.  All written inquiries must be received not later than ten days prior to closing date of solicitation.  Requests for copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Numbered note 1 applies. THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE AMENDMENT NO. 0002 WITH APPLICABLE CHANGES AND ANSWERS TO VENDORS' QUESTIONS.

<DESC>HSCG87-04-R-643104 - Multiple Award Task Order Contract with design-build capabilities for USCG Civil Engineering Unit, Juneau, Alaska.  This will be a two-phase solicitation process with Phase One being a total small business set-aside.  All responsible small business concerns may submit a proposal in response to the Phase One solicitation.  Upon completion of the Phase One competition, a determination will be made regarding further set-asides under Phase Two.  Work anticipated under this project falls within NAICS Sub-sectors 236 (Construction of Buildings) and 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), with a small business size standard of $28.5 million in average annual receipts over the previous three years.  It is anticipated this procurement will result in award of up to five (5) separate IDIQ (task order) construction contracts with design-build capability, primarily for general building type renovation projects, but with some new construction.  Coast Guard facility types are varied, but are predominately housing, office and administrative facilities, aircraft hangars, cutter support team facilities and various types of storage facilities located in marine coastal environments.  The projects will be located in Alaska, primarily in south central, southeast and western Alaska.  Offerors will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on best value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Each contract will be in effect for one year from the date of award with four one-year renewal options.  Award of contracts is anticipated to take place in late September or early October of 2004 dependent upon availability of funding for the initial project and minimum guarantees.  Funds are not presently available for this project.  No award will be made until funds are available.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation at any time prior to award.  The total value of all contracts combined will not exceed $40 million over the potential 5-year period.  The minimum guarantee will be $50,000 per contract.  Projects will vary in size from around $100,000 to a maximum size of $3,000,000 per order with most projects in the $250,000 to $750,000 price range.  The awardees will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on future task announcements, which will vary in stage of design completion from approximately 35% to 100%.  Lack of responsiveness to task announcements may result in the government not exercising the renewal option for extending the contract.  Participation in pre-proposal conferences, site visits and proposal preparation for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and will not be directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable design features in accordance with LEED.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  Professionals responsible for stamping drawings, designs, plats, etc. shall be registered in the State where the project is located.  Phase One of the acquisition process will be the narrowing of the competitive field to no more than eight (8) proposers (design-build teams) based on:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Only those proposers selected in Phase One will be allowed to proceed into Phase Two.  In Phase Two, the successful Phase One offerors will submit technical and price proposals for an initial project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  Offer guarantees/bid bonds will be required for the initial project and future task orders.  The best value proposal will be awarded the initial project and an IDIQ design-build contract with renewal options.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the contractor is awarded no task orders over their total contract term.  Subject to the "fair opportunity" ordering provisions of the contract and FAR 16.505(b), Orders under multiple award contracts, future task orders will be competed among the firms that are awarded an IDIQ, with each task order award based on either "best value" or "lowest price technically acceptable" proposal.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition, and are encouraged to register in the Interested Vendors List in FedBizOpps for this project.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  The Phase One solicitation will be available for download in FedBizOpps on or about April 28, 2004.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable to reduce heat stress associated with current anti-G suit and limit anti-G bladder expansion away from the pilot.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: Current anti-G suits employ 1.7 oz polyurethane-coated nylon bladders, welded flat that inflate to round shapes. These bladders are encased in a sewn and bound 4.3oz aramid shell that is cut slightly smaller than the bladder shape to offload the bladder welds.  
The mechanism of protection is that of direct compression on the vascular tissue below the bladder as well as hoop compression around the body as the surrounding fabric casing tightens to in response to bladder inflation.
The anti-G suit is currently worn over the top of a flight coverall, dry suit, and undergarments.  In the past, the anti-G suit was worn over undergarments but underneath the dry suit and flight coverall. However, its inflation height (thus level of protection) was hampered by the size of the outer garments. Rather than increase the bulk of the outer garments to accommodate the anti-G suit, the anti-G suit was made flame resistant and moved to the outermost layer, and designed to reduce the bulk of the outer garments.  

DEFICIENCIES OF CURRENT BLADDER TECHNOLOGY:  
1) The anti-G suit bladders cover most of the surface area below the waist with impermeable bladders, which also increase thermal load.
2) The anti-G suit bladders are made of flammable, meltable materials, and must be encased within a flame resistant shell.
3) The “football” shape of anti-G suit bladders seem to apply inefficient point compression to tissue, and thus requires large inflated diameters to effect venous return.
4) The anti-G suit weighs up to 6 lbs, and impacts the overall aircrew physical workload.
5) The polyurethane coated nylon fabric is sticky on its coated face, and requires a spacer fabric to prevent kinking.
6) In the current anti-G suit design, if the bladder is damaged the entire suit must be disposed of because access to the bladders is very difficult and attempts to repair the bladder may result in additional damage.
7) The skill level to repair anti-G suits is high – inexperienced sewing machine operators can inadvertently “run over” the bladder, and ruin the asset. Thus no bladder repairs are allowed.
8) The bladder design requires die cutting and die-welding which have expensive initial set-up tooling costs.
9) The polyurethane coated nylon is relatively stiff for its weight, and restricts wearer mobility.
10) The polyurethane coated nylon is noisy when it is moved – a deficiency in a survival/evasion situation.
11) The compression of the coverall, dry suit, and undergarments underneath the anti-G suit restricts mobility, but also creates pressure points from folds 

The applicant must demonstrate the capability to:
1) Reduce the weight, thickness, and stiffness of bladder layer 
2) Employ a channel bladder system rather than the current football to distribute pressure more evenly around body, and to reduce the inflated profile overall
3) Incorporate traditional capstan in conjunction with bladder channels
4) Incorporate holes between bladders where possible to allow heat to escape and any external ventilation air to pass through the suit towards the skin

PROGRAM GOALS:
1) Demonstrate that new bladders can exert necessary vascular compression 
2) Demonstrate that inflated profile is reduced
3) Demonstrate that bladder inflation/deflation occurs as rapidly as current 
4) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is lighter and less bulky 
5) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is more “breathable” – allows more ventilation
6) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders provides commensurate G-protection in centrifuge
7) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders reduces skin temperature and body core temperature of wearer compared to current
Note that demonstrations in centrifuge and on human subjects will be performed by NAWCAD.  Note that demonstrations 1-3 shall include testing on human volunteers.

Interested parties will be evaluated as they are received to determine the following merit criteria; (a) technical and scientific merit; (b) offer’s ability to demonstrate/execute feasibility; (c) offer’s existing capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of the above that will enable the vendor to achieve the intended objective; (d) ability to demonstrate and execute cost savings alternatives.  

The government is interested in written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for the above. Companies responding to this request should provide detailed information on their capabilities and experience to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, AIRCRAFT SUPPORT CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT (Air 2.5.1.3), ATTN: Jessica McGee, Code 2.5.1.3.2.7, 21983 Bundy Road Unit 7 Bldg 441, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. Written responses should be submitted by 19 April 2004 and reference this synopsis number on both the mailing envelope as well as on all enclosed documents.  Interested companies should indicate whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), or large business.  Respondents must clarify if their firm can provide commercial or non-developmental items that could be modified, or the technology and expertise for development, to meet NAWCAD’s needs.  Please address all technical questions to Dr. Barry Shender, Code 4.1.4.1, (301) 342-8881.  Samples and 3-D models are encouraged.  Proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.   This announcement is NOT a Request For Proposal nor does the Government intend to pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis.  Data, samples and 3-D models WILL NOT be returned.  This synopsis does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately on the Federal Bunisess Opportunities website.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Conventional Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) is currently seeking sources for a low cost near all-weather seeker for the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW).  Other potential applications include the Joint Air to Surface Standoff Weapon (JASSM) and Harpoon.  JSOW is a thousand pound class air-to-surface weapon that currently has both an imaging infra-red terminal guidance capability that is capable in degraded weather operation and a global positioning system aided inertial capability capable of all weather operation.  PMA-201 is seeking sources to provide a low cost precision engagement terminal guidance capability in expanded weather conditions against fixed, stationary and moving targets.  Autonomous target acquisition and recognition capability is desired.  JSOW production rates are assumed to be 500 units per year and a total buy of more than 2000 units.  The cost objective for the integrated seeker is $20K.  
The current seeker weight with support structure (but excluding the bulkhead and outer skin) is approximately 40 pounds.  Total volume available in the nose is approximately 850 cubic inches.  Cross section varies from 0 to approximately 13 inches over its 23 inches of length.  The Government intends to test selected sources starting in mid-FY05 to establish a common database for a future acquisition.  The formal insertion program is expected to begin in 2008, production in 2010.  Candidate guidance systems must have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) > 6 or the capability to achieve this level through participation in the test program by the end of 2007.  TRL 6 refers to prototypes that have been demonstrated in a relevant environment.  For more information concerning TRL definitions please refer to the GAO/NSIAD-99-162 “Best Practices” guide.   

Interested parties are requested to reply by 31 June 2004 to CDR Thomas Hole (301) 757-7456 or Mr. Rex Roberts (301) 757-7462.  Email addresses are Thomas.hole@navy.mil and rex.Roberts@navy.mil, respectively.  Please provide a technical briefing that includes your company’s capability to provide mature sensor technology emphasizing cost, weather, and autonomous detection and recognition characteristics.

<DESC>The Department of State is soliciting information from well-qualified GSA Schedule 70, SIN 132.51 - Information Technology Services companies to integrate Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) automated face recognition (FR) system(s) into the Department's visa and/or passport operations.  In addition to tailoring the FR system(s) to meet the Department's needs, the company selected will be required to install and maintain the system(s), as well as to update the system(s) periodically to the evolving state-of-the-art.  Biometric technology is required by the Department to meet mandates in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  Information on terminology and the performance of commercial FR systems may be obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Website for the Face Recognition Vendor Test-2002.  (See http://www.frvt.org.)

The FR system(s) may be required to do some, or all, of the following: 

a.  Provide one-to-many automated face matching (the term ‘many’ in this context may be interpreted to mean from at least 30 million face images or templates in the database),
b.  Provide one-to-one automated face matching, and
c.  Generate statistical reports from the data captured.

As the first step in this process, if your company would like to be considered to receive the Request for Quotation (RFQ) for this effort, please respond to this announcement.  Your “letter of interest” response should be less than two pages long and should describe your company’s experience with and knowledge of FR or other biometric systems, with particular emphasis on applications in government and those involving one-to-many matching.  Include within your “letter of interest” the following information:  (1) name and address of company; (2) ownership (including Country of Ownership and indicating whether your company is Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), or Women-Owned); (3) two points of contact, including: name, title, phone, fax, and e-mail address; (4) name of COTS FR software system(s) being considered for this opportunity; (5) a list of customers for which relevant biometric work has been performed during the past five years, including a summary of work performed, type of biometric, biometric software package(s) used, and a customer point of contact with phone number (this information is required to verify company’s performance; the government may contact any reference for further validation). 

The Department expects to award a contract to one company.  To ensure that companies possess qualifications that would enable them to be competitive within the requirements of this procurement, and to limit the number of Offerors that prepare RFQ responses, the government, working with its contractor (Mitretek Systems, Inc.), will conduct a preliminary selection following receipt of letters of interest to this announcement. 

Up to twenty companies will be selected to respond to a Request for Quotation.  Based on an evaluation of these responses, up to three companies will be selected to submit their offered COTS FR system(s) for laboratory testing by the Department of State and its contractor (Mitretek Systems, Inc.).  Based on the evaluation of these three offered COTS FR system(s), and other submitted documentation, a company will be selected.

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  All interested respondents are required to be American Owned.  Responses received that do not include all requested information will be considered non-responsive.  The Government may or may not act upon any information received.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement, or any follow-up information requests.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  It is the company’s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the RFQ and amendments (if any). 

Interested potential sources are invited to submit a letter of interest along with a description of capabilities by 4:00 p.m.EDT. on April 16, 2004.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Responses may be e-mailed to: Stewartj@state.gov or faxed to (703) 875-6085 to the attention of the Contracting Officer, with the hard copy to follow in overnight mail addressed to Jo-Ann Stewart, P.O. Box 9115, Rosslyn Station, Arlington, VA  22219.

Request for Information (RFI)
Statement of Objectives
DLA Customer Assessment Program

Purpose of RFI:

1.  To provide industry the opportunity to comment on the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Customer Assessment Program and to obtain information on effective customer assessment strategies in order to most effectively gauge DLA customer satisfaction with DLA support.  

2.  To announce the intentions of DLA to seek information which may lead to a complete revision of the current DLA Customer Assessment Program , including customer satisfaction surveys, based on the background provided below.

3.  To engage industry and other interested parties in an exchange of information on customer assessment strategies/methodologies relative to DLA’s customer satisfaction.

It should be noted that we are not seeking a philosophical discussion on theories and concepts.

Background:

DLA is a DoD agency that provides supply support and technical logistics services to military services, DoD agencies, federal agencies and selected foreign governments.  It procures supplies and spare parts for customers and supports their logistics needs.  This support begins with logistics planning, extends through production and concludes with the disposal of material that is obsolete, worn out or no longer needed.

DLA is the one logistics support source for a wide range of customer needs for combat readiness, emergency readiness or day-to-day operations.  DLA provides support for 89% of all DoD consumable items and more then 55% of all federally stocked items.  DLA’s annual customer sales total $14.2 billion and its total purchases per year total $10.4 billion.  Support includes:

·	4.1 million consumable items that include fuel, food, clothing, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, general and industrial products, electronics products, weapons systems spare parts for over 1,400 weapons systems and more.
·	state of the art distribution and storage system
·	worldwide property disposal services including reutilization
·	worldwide hazardous material disposal services and information on management of hazardous material
·	catalogue and printing services
·	technical logistics services such as lab testing

DLA’s current customer assessment program has been in place since 1999.  A traditional mail-out survey has been used to measure DLA overall customer satisfaction. There are 10  DLA Field Activities (FAs) participating in the survey program currently.  Each FA has responsibility for different types of support therefore making each one unique.  Because there is such diversity in FAs, the actual questionnaire is separated into 3 sections; core, non-core and verbatim questions.  The core questions are unique to all 10 survey instrument.  The non-core questions specifically relate to each FA’s uniqueness.  The 3rd section includes 3 verbatim “write-in” questions where customers have the opportunity to provide their comments on DLA support.  The questionnaires were issued 4 times per year from FY 99 – FY 02 and reduced to two times per year starting in FY 03 since the survey response data was stable enough to do so.  The survey is issued to a Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC) sample of approximately 12,000 customers per cycle/24,000 per year as of FY 03.  

It should be noted that DLA is open to potentially changing all or some of the current customer satisfaction survey program.

One of the problems currently encountered is a very low and continuously declining response rate.  One of the major reasons for the low response rate is the DODAAC database that is used to mail surveys to customers is insufficient.  This database contains unit address information only which means that the surveys are mailed directly to a unit but not to any specific individual.  Therefore it is impossible to know who is actually filling out the survey questionnaires. DLA has no customer database with named customers and contact information such as phone numbers and email addresses.  

Finally, DLA is in the discovery stage of a full fledged Customer Relationship Management Program (CRM) and therefore any customer assessment program will have to directly coincide with DLA’s CRM program.

Statement of Objectives:

1.  To understand what types of qualitative research might be used measure what is most important to the customer i.e.; satisfaction?  Readiness?  Loyalty? Etc.  What qualitative analysis is used to determine what is important to the customer?

2.  To gain a firm understanding of what methodologies might be appropriate in developing a comprehensive customer assessment program for DLA and what implementation of such a program entails.  A methodology must utilize the best methods to obtain the most accurate and insightful feedback from DLA customers so that the feedback is actionable to the maximum extent practical for DLA to improve customer service.  What techniques does industry use to obtain the most actionable items for an organization to improve upon customer service?

3.  To gain a firm understanding of the best types of analysis and reporting that can be done once an assessment program is developed.  Such analysis should be thorough and in an easily understandable format and should include detailed findings and recommendations so that DLA can use feedback to improve upon customer support.  

4.  To understand the most important criteria for both an internal and external customer feedback communication plan. It is important to internally share among DLA counterparts, any types of action taken in response to customer feedback so that members of DLA worldwide can learn from their counterparts.  It is important to externally share actions taken in response to customer feedback so that customers feel the effect of good support.

5.  To gain knowledge and solution alternatives from industry on effectively addressing the current concern of low response rate.  What tools can be used?

6.  To gain knowledge and alternative solutions from industry on the most effective way to develop a customer profile database that will include names, phone numbers, email addresses and any other pertinent profile information for some 22,000 customers.  What approaches are available to establish a customer profiled database of this magnitude?

7.  To understand the frequency rate of proposed methodologies and the various types of survey instruments and methods that may be utilized in a comprehensive customer assessment program.  What types of assessment vehicles are available and how often should they be issued as a measurement tool?

8.  What techniques are used for determining a world class benchmark and how can DLA be measured against it?

9.  What are the approximate cost ranges for a comprehensive customer assessment program?

10.  What types and how many labor categories are required for a comprehensive customer assessment program?

This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). ONDCP has a requirement for the performance of three tasks: 1) to develop a Public Service Announcement (PSA) campaign to specifically address the cynicism many people have about the drug problem generally, their ability to make a difference in their community, and to create a sense of urgency that will motivate people to get involved; 2) to review the costs associated with the production of new advertisements to determine eligibility and proprietary of reimbursement; and 3) to support the process for receiving and determining the eligibility of nationally submitted public service announcements to support the pro bono match component of the Media Campaign, consistent with ONDCP's Media Match Policy. The Advertising Council, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization is considered to possess unique qualifications to focus public attention on relevant issues through advertising and communications programs that mobilize the public will to deal with important issues and help promote the necessary citizen action to address the issues effectively in that process. The Advertising Council, since its inception, has marshaled volunteer talent from the advertising and communications communities, the facilities of the media, and the resources of the business and non-profit communities to create awareness, foster understanding, and generate appropriate public response. The Advertising Council has risen to preeminent stature in advertising in the community and has been responsible for the creation and management of the majority of public service advertising in the United States; they stand in a unique position to analyze advertisements that may be appropriate to stock the media match component of the campaign. With respect to reviewing the proprietary of public service announcements, The Advertising Council engages in a creative review process at all iterative stages of public service ad creation. The Advertising Council conducts production advertisements for ten Federal agencies and 30-not-for-profit organizations, including the United Negro College Fund, the leadership Conference Education Fund, and the America's Promise-the-Alliance for Youth. The Advertising Council has historical expertise which is considered necessary for analyzing the propriety of production costs associated with the creation of a range of new advertisements designed to fulfill the goals of the campaign. The Advertising Council has extensive experience in developing, executing, managing, and media placement of public service advertising/recruitment campaigns, having performed such campaigns for the Coalition for America's Children, Covenant House, Earth Share, American Red Cross, United Way, and the Points of Light Foundation. Statutory authority for the sole source is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The contract period will be a twelve month base period plus four, twelve month option periods. Offerors able to provide the required service are invited to identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements by submitting their qualifications/capabilities and any other information which shows a bona fide ability to meet this requirement. If no affirmative responses are received to determine that a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available, a contract will be awarded to the above named source. The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  No solicitation documents exist and requests for such documents will be considered non-responsive and not accepted.

<SUBJECT>85 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  The following items have been identified: Jumbo Toilet Tissue/Center Pull Towels, NSN 8540-00NIB-0007 - 2 ply Jumbo Roll, 2000 feet of paper, 12 inch diameter, 6 rolls per box; 8540-00-NIB-0061 - 1 ply Jumbo Roll, 2000 feet of paper, 9 inch diameter, 12 rolls per box; 8540-00-NIB-0063 - 2 ply Jumbo Roll, 1000 feet of paper, 9 inch diameter, 12 rolls per box; 8540-00-NIB-0064 - Center Pull Towels, 2 ply white, 600 sheets at 8.25 x 12 inches per sheet, 6 rolls per box.  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Request for Information (RFI) for Anthrax Therapeutics
<DESC>***  BACKGROUND  ***  

The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters.  In 2002, HHS established the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OASPHEP).  This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population.

The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OASPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency.  An example of such a product is Anthrax Recombinant Protective Antigen (rPA) vaccine.

  ***  DESCRIPTION  ***  

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. 
Bacillus anthracis is considered among the most-likely biological agent threat confronting the national security of the United States.  B. anthracis is particularly effective in inducing disease when spores are released as an aerosol.  The primary mortality and morbidity of B. anthracis is mediated through a toxemia.  Antibiotics target the vegetative B. anthracis bacteria but antitoxins are necessary to neutralize the effects of the toxins and ensure a more successful therapeutic outcome.  DHHS is seeking to be advised of the availability of commercial products, or products in advanced development, for immunotherapeutic or immunoprophylactic antitoxin treatments, or small molecular entity treatments (such as, but not limited to, mutant toxins, therapeutic proteins, enzymes, lysins, and protease inhibitors) for anthrax toxemia. Specifically these may include monoclonal and polyclonal antibody toxin inhibitors and inhibitors of intracellular anthrax toxin function, as well as inhibitors of the effects of toxins. Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation’s bioterrorism defense needs. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS.  Submitted information should  include: 
a) a description of the product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics;
b) a description of the mechanism of action of the product;
c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration;
d) a statement of the proposed indications for use (e.g. pre or post exposure prophylaxis or treatment);
e) a statement of the proposed production process and the current state of validation or GMP compliance;
f) an estimate of production capacity and timelines, and estimated cost;
g) a product development plan for GMP production, animal and human studies; and 
h) the overall stage of product development including the current status of preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies.

All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law, including the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552) and the Trade Secrets Act (18 USC 1905).  Information must be submitted by May 1, 2004.  Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and can be e-mailed to the attention of the technical contact person:  Marissa A. Miller, DVM, MPH, ORDC, Phone 202/690-6013, email Marissa.Miller@hhs.gov

Please ensure that at least TWO (2) COPIES of all responses are submitted:  one to the technical contact person, Marissa A. Miller, and one to the primary contracting point of contact, Vivian Hubbs.

<DESC>The United States Air Force Research Laboratory Air Vehicle Directorate (AFRL/VA) is seeking quantitative information to justify the development of technologies that will reduce the total airframe weight for advanced high altitude long endurance intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) air vehicle platforms.  This type of platform is generically referred to as Sensorcraft.   The objective is to identify the technologies that will have the greatest effect on reducing the overall weight of a Sensorcraft class air vehicle.  Minimum weight will likely be achieved by an integration of multiple technologies and design methodologies such as: novel structural arrangements and concepts that may effectively reduce the load bearing requirements of some multifunctional members, application of novel material product forms, synergistic embedment of sensors, subsystems, and equipment in structure, load control and alleviation, and design criteria and methodology.   The propulsion system itself is not included in this development objective.   Responders to this RFI are requested to provide descriptions and quantitative estimates of weight saving potential for the technologies with the highest weight savings potential.  Descriptions should include the current technology readiness levels (TRL) and cost estimations to develop the technology to TRL 6.  The technologies with the greatest weight savings potential may be developed under upcoming exploratory and advanced development contract research and development programs. In addition to proposed technologies, candidate responses should include information regarding:  technical competency in terms of engineering and facilities; prior company technical experience in relation to the topic; collaboration with other research organization or agencies; and biographies of technical experts.

I. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

1. 	SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and transportation necessary to complete all vegetation trimming, tree trimming and/or tree removal for Power Line Runs located in the Military Family Housing (MFH) area, McChord AFB, Washington. Vegetation Trimming and Tree Trimming or Removal shall be accomplished in a manner that meets both the environmental and line clearance needs while heeding all applicable safety precautions. The contractor shall ensure compliance with all Federal, State and local laws and regulations while providing vegetation trimming, tree trimming or tree removal infringing into the Power Line area. Vegetation, tree branch trimming or tree removal distances shall comply with distances referenced in "NATIONAL ELECTRICAL SAFETY CODE,"  "NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE," and AFJMAN 32-1082 Facilities Engineering Electrical Exterior Facilities, Section XIV. Project completion shall be 90 days from the award contract. 

II. SERVICE DELIVERY SUMMARY

2.0 	Magnitude of Trimming. Complete tree and vegetation trimming for high-voltage (13.8 kV) electrical distribution line right of ways having an estimated total length of approximately six (6) miles and Secondary lines to Housing Units. Appendix 1 – Tree Survey 2004, available upon request, shows an approximate number and location of trees for trimming/removal. Trees shall be trimmed to have a maximum clearance as measured from the outermost conductor, on each side, to the edge of vegetation. All power line tree trimming occurring within 15 feet of energized power lines must be supervised by a journeyman lineman or a person who has successfully completed an OSHA certified line clear training program. 

2.1	Tree Condition. Trees must be left in as sound of a condition and appearance as possible. If leaving the tree in reasonable condition and appearance is incompatible with necessary clearance, the tree may need to be removed. One exception to the referenced AFJMAN will be to omit the requirement to treat the tree trimming wounds (found in paragraph 4-58 of the AFJMAN). If trimming will be so severe that it is likely the trimming will result in a dead tree, the tree should be removed, after receiving approval from the designated government official. 

2.2	Tree Removal. Prior to removal of any tree, the Contractor shall contact the designated government official for approval. The Government is specifically interested in retaining Garry Oaks / Oregon White Oaks at McChord AFB. Should an entire tree located in an undeveloped area (i.e. when electrical lines are routed through wooded areas) needs to be removed; the stump of the removed tree shall be cut no higher than 2 inches above the adjacent natural grade. Should an entire tree that is located in any other area need to be removed, the stump shall be ground 4 inches below grade with the resulting wood chips transported to an approved disposal area. Rock free top soil shall be applied to fill the ground stump hole and certified weed free rye grass seed applied.

2.3	Salvageable Wood Disposal.  Salvageable wood is defined as all trees and limbs with a diameter of six inches or more. The Contractor shall cut all salvageable wood into lengths of eight feet or less and haul to designated location on McChord Air Force Base identified by the Quality Assurance Person (QAP).  The Contractor will remove all salvageable wood the same day that it is cut in developed areas (housing areas or within 75 feet of base facilities).

2.3.1 	Tree Debris Disposal. Tree debris is defined as all trees and limbs less than six inches in diameter. The Contractor will remove all tree  debris  the same day that it is cut in developed areas. Also collect all fine (needles, leaves) tree debris lying on the ground in the vicinity of the tree generated by trimming/removal.  Grass and bark areas shall be raked, streets, sidewalks and walkways shall be swept or otherwise cleaned to remove all fine debris from area.  All pruning debris shall be removed on a daily basis from developed  areas.  Debris not picked up at the end of the work day shall be piled and marked with cones on main base public areas (areas that can be seen from paved streets).  Debris shall be removed from all roadways and roads made passable at the end of the workday. The Contractor will transport all debris less than six inches in diameter off base for proper disposal.

2.3.2	Trimmed limbs of trees in undeveloped areas (with the exception of those trees or tree limbs with a diameter of six inches or more cut into lengths of eight feet or less and haul to designated location on McChord Air Force Base identified by the QAP ), shall be chipped, discarded, and spread out adjacent the cleared right of way into the undeveloped areas. Chips should not be blown up steep banks where there is a potential for them to wash back down, filling roadway ditches. Where chips are blown on site they should spread evenly with a depth not to exceed 3 inches.

2.4 	SITE CONDITIONS:  MFH is an integral part of McChord's "Base Appearance Program."  The Contractor shall repair damaged turf and replace shrubs, fencing and lawn sprinkler heads damaged by the service provider's actions.

<DESC>OST Consulting Services

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to award a sole-source procurement to McCreight and Company.  NGA has a need to procure consulting services in support of the NGA Office of Strategic Transformation (OST).  The purpose of this effort is to gain the expertise of commercial industry in the areas of organizational strategy development and implementation.  The proposed work will include providing recommendations and the development of the most efficient and effective processes, and organizational changes in numerous areas of execution, e.g., financial management, business operations, business models, and performance measurements.  The intellectual capital and focused knowledge to support the planning study builds upon the baseline strategy articulated in the Enterprise Operating Framework. McCreight and company was a significant contributor to this effort.

McCreight is the only source that can perform these services due to their knowledge of NGA’s Strategic Intent, previous transformation plans and initiatives such as the Corporate Transformation Business Plan, and the results of the NGA Transformation Report produced by the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSGI) Enterprise Transformation Product Team (NETIPT), which was chartered in May 2002.  Further, due to previous work performed by McCreight and Company in support of OST they possess current knowledge of NGA’s mission, functions, business strategies, current operating construct, and understand the organization’s role with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense.  Having any other vendor perform these services would cause a delay of approximately six months to the government for the new contractor to develop the technical expertise comparable to McCreight and Company.

This is a synopsis of intent to award an Indefinite Delivery – Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract utilizing FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items procedures. The authority for sole source procurement is FAR 6.302-1(a), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Responsible sources that are interested in this procurement may respond by providing clear and convincing information that identifies their ability to provide the product. 

All responses must be e-mailed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Attn:  Christina Griffin, GriffinCh@nga.mil by 2:00 P.M., EST, 12 April 2004. It is the responsibility of the sender to confirm if e-mails have been received.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional rare book cataloging services on a sole source basis from Costabile Associates, Inc, Bethesda, MD.  The purchase order term will be August 19, 2004 through August 18, 2005 with options for four (4) successive one-year periods.  The NLM has approximately 2000 items printed in Great Britain and Ireland in the 18th century which have only minimal records in the library catalog, OCLC and RLIN, and occasionally lack records altogether.  The records which exist usually lack proper transcriptions and standard descriptive cataloging, including name authority work.  Some of the material is in Latin and French.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain cataloging services for the library's 18th-century English Short Title Catalog (ESTC) material.   The project entails: 1) identifying ESTC materials in the NLM Voyager database with minimal cataloging and retrieving them from the collection; 2) examining title pages, colophons, and other sources of information in the books; 3) searching the titles in the RLIN ESTC database; 3) creating or updating records for each item in the NLM database using, all to the standards of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (Chicago: ALA, 1998.) and Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books (Washington, DC: LC, 1991); 4) creating or updating name authority records for authors, editors, illustrators, former owners or other added entries needed for the bibliographic records.  Costabile Associates, Inc. is the only known source capable of providing the cataloging services noted above.  Costabile Associates employee Mr. Emmett Dever Powell worked at the Folger Shakespeare Library for five years as Senior ESTC Cataloger, where his responsibilities included matching and updating MARC records in the RLIN ESTC database; inputting complete bibliographic descriptions, including signature collations, variants, imperfections, bindings, and contemporary MS notations; researching and inputting provenance; and acting as a liaison between Folger staff and the ESTC/NA project.  He is also familiar with Endeavor's Voyager software, used by NLM for its online catalog, and he reads Latin and French fluently.  Companies interested in provided cataloging services to NLM must perform 90% of the services onsite.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H.

accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional 
information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only 
solicitation: quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not

Eastern Standard Time, April 05, 2004, will be considered by the government solely for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
Contractor support for Logo Development and Branding


	I.	BACKGROUND

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), located in Washington, D.C., is one of the world's leading statistical agencies. Although it is a relatively small agency, BEA produces some of the most closely watched economic statistics that influence the decisions made by government officials, business people, households, and individuals. BEA's economic statistics, which provide a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the U.S. economy, are key ingredients in critical decisions affecting monetary policy, tax and budget projections, and business investment plans. 

The cornerstone of BEA's statistics is the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), which feature the estimates of a gross domestic product (GDP) and related measures. The GDP was recognized by the Department of Commerce as its greatest achievement of the 20th century and has been ranked as one of the three most influential measures that affect U.S. financial markets. Since the NIPAs were first published, BEA has developed and extended its estimates to cover a wide range of economic activities. Today, BEA prepares national, regional, industry, and international accounts that present essential information on such key issues as economic growth, regional economic development, inter-industry relationships, and the nations’ position in the world economy.
