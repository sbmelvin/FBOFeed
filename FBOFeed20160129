<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.

<p>Laser Head Dimensions: &lt;29 x 17 x 7cm (&lt;11.5 x 6.7 x 2.6 inches), L x W x H<br />ICE-BLOCTM Controller Dimensions: 34cm x Half Rack x 2U, L x W x H<br />AC Power: 90 - 264 VAC, 2.5 A max.<br />Cooling: Supplied closed-loop water<br />Environmental Requirements: Operating temperature range: 16-300C, Max. relative humidity: 80% non-condensing, up to 300C</p>
<p>Tuning Range: 720-940 nm<br />Output Power (Modelocked): &gt; 0.6 W at ~725 nm, &gt; 1.3 W at ~800 nm, &gt; 0.6 W at ~935 nm<br />Pulse Width: &lt;150fs<br />Amplitude Noise: &lt;0.125%<br />Output Power Stability: &lt;0.5% <br />Pulse Repetition Rate: 80 MHz <br />Polarization: Horizontal &gt;500:1<br />Spatial Mode: TEMoo (M2&lt; 1.1)<br />Beam Diameter: 1.2mm<br />Beam Ellipticity: 0.9 to 1.1<br />Astigmatism: &lt;10%<br />Beam Pointing: 0.4 urad/nm<br />Operating Voltage: 90-264 Vac, 47-63 Hz<br />Maximum Operating Current: &lt;3 A at 100 Vac., 1.5 A at 230 Vac (entire system)<br />Operating Temperature Range: 20-35 C</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for the purchase of the system described above. The identified sole-source provider/producer of these systems is as follows:</p>
<p>M Squared Lasers Inc<br />Cambridge Innovation Center<br />1 Broadway, 14th Floor<br />Cambridge, MA 02142</p>
<p>The Government has determined that there are no other known commercial offerings that meet the required capabilities. The required application requires extremely high system stability as these experiments require long hours of operation, requiring narrow linewidth excitation of atomic transitions, extremely stable optical pules, and extremely low beam walks for coupling into optical fiber.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Tabitha.Haggart@us.af.mil</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 18 March 2016.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 10-21-15.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approved sources are: <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: ">Meggitt (North Hollywood) Inc. CAGE 79318.</span></p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

Contract Award Dollar Amount: TBD<br />13. Contract Line Item Number TBD<br />14. Contract Award Date: TBD<br />15. Contractor: TBD<br />16. Description: <br />This solicitation is for one self-sustaining, U.S. flagged vessel, capable of maintaining an average speed of sixteen (16) knots and minimum operating range of 13,000 nautical miles (nm). The vessel shall have a minimum capacity of 2,350 TEUs and provide climate control for a minimum of 1,350 TEU ammunition laden containers. <br />Duration of the contract period: One 5 month base period with four 1-year option periods and one 5-month option period.<br />All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.<br />17. Place of Contract Performance: Worldwide<br />18. Set-aside Status: This procurement will be competed as a tiered small business set-aside. If the government receives offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery; no offers received from other than small business concerns will be considered for award. If the Government does not receive offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery; all offers, including offers from other than small business concerns, will be considered for award. <br />19. Rationale for Small Business Strategy (as required by ASN(RDA) Memorandum, Improving Communications During the Market Research Process, dated 2 June 2014): The Contracting Officer could not make a conclusive determination, in an effort to promote small business participation, whether at least two or more offers would be received from small business concerns meeting the solicitation requirements at fair market prices. She determined that the use of a tiered or cascading evaluation of offers would be appropriate in accordance with DFARS 215.203-70 based on results of competition under RFP N62387-15-R-3000. MSC's Small Business Associate Director and SBA PCR concurs with the determination of a tiered small business set-aside.</p>

Satisfying this short-term requirement is an interim solution which will provide the VA with additional time whilst they progress with acquisition planning towards long term grounds maintenance requirements.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil . While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitation to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD). This RFI is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201(e), and is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor should it be construed as such. Respondents are advised that NSWCDD is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or reimburse RFI preparation costs incurred by any offeror when providing the information requested under this notice. If a solicitation is released at a future date, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) has a requirement for the manufacture, assembly, inspection, and acceptance of Gun Weapon Systems (GWS) components such as; Ammunition Handling System (AHS), Trainable Gun Mounts (TGM), Gun Computer Cabinets (GCC), Gun Power Cabinets (GPC) assemblies, and all future redesigned and upgraded assemblies that come from research and development stages of programs.</p>
<p>Previous machining and manufacturing efforts have led to NSWCDD requiring a Multi Award Contract (MAC) to meet these requirements. Additionally, this allowed for certain machining and manufacturing processes to be tracked more efficiently than using a large quantity of different companies. This increases Division success rate in gaining better workmanship by allowing companies to build their experience in manufacturing similar products for the Government. All of these products and systems are custom built, with Government owned designs. The total effort will cover the manufacturing, assembling, inspection, and delivery of future GWS components built for Battle Management System (BMS) programs.</p>
<p>The Contractor will receive a Technical Data Package (TDP) or drawings from the Government, which includes all design and fabrication specifications, mechanical drawings, and assembly procedures for 30mm and 105mm GWS systems. The Contractor shall inspect the TDP or drawings, and maintain close communication during the decomposition and manufacturing preparation stage. The Contractor shall manufacture all parts within the TDP or drawings. The Contractor shall assemble the particular GWS components with the manufactured parts. The Contractor shall follow all tolerances and specifications given by the Government. The Contractor shall deliver the assembled GWS system or components to NSWCDD where the system or components will either be integrated into a larger system, or delivered to the warfighter.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the following certifications:<br />-ISO 9001<br />-AS9100</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have and use a manufacturing facility located within 300 miles of NSWCDD. Additionally, NSWCDD engineers require the ability to respond to urgent or rapid development prototyping or technical and developmental changes to technical specifications. This primarily happens before final approval of a TDP, which requires on-the-spot "test fits" or certain minor changes. The purpose behind this is to prevent spending substantial Government dollars for production parts, which is considered wasteful by the Government.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall identify any long-lead components that are necessary for delivery of these products.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall revise and make the same changes that are documented by the Government during the Government's production and integration cycles.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit Engineering Change Proposal(s) (ECP) to the Government that addresses any issues found during manufacture and assembly process.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall document all manufacturing and assembly processes and changes, and submit the documentation to the Government.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall receive, track, inventory, issue, and monitor all material, equipment, technical data, and logistic support items throughout the entire acquisition process.</p>
<p>The Government has a strong desire to fabricate or manufacture as many of the components as possible in-house vs. outsourcing or subcontracting.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have ability to fabricate and assemble sheet metal parts in house.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the capability and facilities to weld.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the capability to machine parts with dimensions up to 20 feet.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the capability to machine parts weighing up to 2,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be capable of machining directly from SolidWorks CAD models.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the ability to produce electrical assemblies such as wiring harnesses and electrical units.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the capability of various heat treating processes.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the capability of various specialized coating capabilities to include phosphate coating and hard cote anodize.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop a shipping plan to deliver assembled items to NSWC, B198. After this shipping plan has been approved by the Government, the Contractor shall use this plan throughout the contract period of performance. The Contractor shall not change this delivery method or plan unless approved by the COR.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall participate in any teleconferences with NSWC as required.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall participate in a contract kick-off meeting with NSWC and shall provide presentation materials.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop and conduct a Quality Assurance Plan. After approval from the Government, the Quality Assurance Plan shall be placed under Contractor configuration control. Any revision shall require Government approval.</p>
<p>Subsequent deliverables shall pass a Government developed and conducted Quality Assurance Plan prior to official acceptance.</p>
<p>The Government retains the right to reject or require correction of any deficiencies found in hardware deliverables. In the event of a rejection of any deliverable, the Government shall notify the Contractor, in writing, within 10 calendar days of receipt. The Contractor shall have 2 calendar days to develop a plan. The Contractor shall have 7 calendar days to correct the rejected deliverable and resubmit to the Government for re-inspection. If no comments are provided with 45 calendar days of receipt of deliverable, the deliverable shall be deemed acceptable by the Government.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall label all assemblies, sub-assemblies, and components IAW all Government drawings. The Contractor shall give the Government all necessary packing list and materials certification information with deliveries.</p>
<p>The efforts required for this requirement are expected to be UNCLASSIFIED, and should not require Contractor personnel to obtain a security clearance. However, material will be For Official Use Only (FOUO), and should not be seen or given to any other organization, party, or person.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel shall not release or remove system documentation, data, or reports generated by or through the use of Government systems. All requests for information shall be forwarded to the Government. No information shall be released without written approval from the Government.</p>
<p>No travel is estimated as being required at this time.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase Order for management of and online access to the MRL Database.  

The U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyÂ¿s (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management intends to award a sole source, fixed-price purchase order on behalf of the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPPÂ¿s) Registration Support Branch.  The purchase order will be issued under the authority of FAR Part 13.501(a), Â¿Sole Source Acquisitions,Â¿ in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1901.  The purchase order will be issued to to Bryant Christie, Inc. for continued maintenance of and access to Bryant ChristieÂ¿s Minimum Residue Level (MRL) database for one base and four option years.

The MRL database is a critical resource for EPA to support its mission.  It is a resource for Agency officials to access and compare foreign residue standards.  As such, it facilitates the development of US Government policy, allows the Agency to respond to constituent inquiries, develop official comments on foreign proposed standards, and identify which foreign standards are inconsistent with international norms and could present a potential barrier to trade.  

Bryant Christie, Inc. is the sole provider of the MRL database.  While other residue databases exist, EPA has identified the MRL database as the most comprehensive and up-to-date.  Bryant Christie has relationships with 83 different governments and shares MRLs in a single database.  The Agency believes that there is no other database available that contains the volume, detail, and currency of information needed to support its mission.  

NO SOLICITATION FOR QUOTES IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. 
Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the requirements as stated herein, may submit capability documentation no later than 1:00 PM  ET on Friday, 12 February, 2016 for consideration.  A determination not to compete the purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  

All responses must be sent via FedConnect.  FedConnect is a web portal that connects agencies and contractors to streamline the process of doing business with the federal government. There is no charge to use FedConnect.  Contractors can register with FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/.  For assistance in registering, or for other FedConnect technical questions, contractors should call the FedConnect Help Desk at (800) 899-6665 or email at support@fedconnect.net.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) was created in 1980 by combining offices from several federal agencies. The Department's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.
<p>The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides the technological solutions that enable the Department to deliver world-class service to schools, students and their families. To accomplish its mission, OCIO advises and assists the Secretary and other senior officers in acquiring information technology (IT) and managing information resources. OCIO helps these leaders comply with the best practices in the industry and applicable federal laws and regulations, including the Clinger Cohen Act, the Government Paperwork Reduction Act and the Federal Information Security Management Act. In addition, the agency's Chief Information Officer is charged with establishing a management framework that leads the agency toward more efficient and effective operations, including improved planning and control of IT investments.</p>
<p>On September 27, 2007, the Department replaced its enterprise wide network and IT support services contract, known as the Education Network Contract (EDNET), with the Education Department Utility for Communications, Applications, and Technology Environment (EDUCATE) Contract. EDUCATE is a 10-year performance-based contract (Base Year, plus 9 option periods) that moved the Department from a Government-Owned, Contactor-Operated (GOCO) IT environment to a Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (COCO) managed IT infrastructure service model. The contract provides IT resources to all Department employees and Contractors - approximately 6,200 users who work in Washington, D.C., 10 regional offices in the Continental US and Puerto Rico and various Satellite Offices. The EDUCATE Contractor provides the fully-managed services that include infrastructure, computers, telecommunications devices, an e-mail network, the Department's Internet and intranet sites, servers, telephone systems and network printers, and other services and equipment as needed.</p>
<p>In May 2015, the Department began initial requirements gathering from all interested parties from within the Department. Requirements gathering efforts have focused on understanding both the functional and technical needs of business process and system owners in terms of the services to be offered and delivered via the next generation of OCIO IT Service contracts. The Department conducted a Market Research Industry Day on 22 June 2015 followed by an invitation to comment on the business requirements that were published as part of the first request for information (RFI) (#EDCIO15112017RFI1).</p>
<p>Additional details regarding the Market Research Industry Day can be found at:</p>

<p><br />The Department has evaluated the responses to the first RFI and drafted the second RFI associated with this planned procurement. All interested parties are highly encouraged to review this RFI and respond in accordance with the RFI instructions contained in the accompanying documents.</p>
<p>Please note that clarification questions are due 08 February 2016.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) -For identifying a third party software tool that simplifies the administration of all aspects of an enterprise SharePoint environment - Department of Defense (DOD) Agency.
<p>Solicitation Number: N/A<br />RFI Number: 2016-10<br />Agency: Defense Contract Management Agency<br />Office: Contracting<br />Location: DCMA-AQ, Fort Lee, VA<br />Synopsis: Questions pertaining to this RFI are due by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, February 8, 2016. Final responses should be submitted by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, February 23, 2016.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.</p>
<p>This notice consists of four parts:</p>
<p>PART I. INTRODUCTION<br />PART II. BACKGROUND<br />PART III. AREAS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS SOUGHT <br />PART IV. HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION<br />The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is solely for information and planning purposes ONLY and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service.</p>
<p>PART II. BACKGROUND<br />The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) work force is a geographically distributed agency that requires effective and efficient collaboration capabilities to meet both their Mission Critical needs as well as the basic support requirements to conduct business on a daily basis. To meet these needs the agency has introduced Microsoft SharePoint to its workforce as its primary collaboration tool. DCMA's SharePoint instance, known as DCMA 360, is in the early phases of introduction and adoption by the workforce and is successfully being used by Contract Management Offices (CMOs) located both within the continental United States and abroad. These offices support the needs of roughly 13000 personnel sitting at disparate locations around the globe as well as those individuals that represent partner agencies and contractors that assist DCMA in the daily completion of its objectives and goals. The global distribution of the CMOs, the diverse jobs of the individuals using DCMA 360, and the ever evolving requirements of the agency workforce have created the challenging task of governing the SharePoint environment. As a result, the agency has identified key deficiencies in DCMA's SharePoint Farm Administrator's abilities to manage the scope of the DCMA 360 environment. It was determined that a tool that will improve the ability to globally surveil and manage the entirety of DCMA's SharePoint sites was needed. This tool will allow the administrators to configure, report, react to and audit any DCMA 360 asset provisioned in the farm and would streamline the effort required to manage and govern DCMA 360 as it evolves during its adoption by the agency workforce. The purpose of this RFI is to request information from interested parties pertaining to different third party toolsets available on the market that may meet the needs of DCMA's SharePoint farm administrators. This tool must possess the capabilities provided below.</p>
<p>PART III. AREAS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS SOUGHT</p>
<p>1) Organization, address, email address, telephone number, CAGE Code, DUNS Number, and Company Size.</p>
<p>2) What software solution(s) does your company offer for the following SharePoint administration capabilities? <br />a. Creating and managing new site collections<br />i. Enable farm administrators with the ability to quickly create sites and provision them with pre-defined functionality such as specific access privileges, versioning levels, file upload limits, site quotas and the use of branded site templates. <br />b.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />
<p><br />The National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to continue supporting both the NIDDK Genetics and Biosample Repositories. <br /> <br /><strong>NIDDK GENETICS REPOSITORY. </strong></p>
<p>The Genetics repository will allow the continued storage, maintenance, and quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to the study of diseases under the mandate of the NIDDK. It facilitates sharing of resources, thus encouraging work by a broad group of investigators and perhaps, increasing the sample size and the resulting power of a study to identify the genetic determinants of a disease. It helps to ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts. The current contractor is the Rutgers State University.</p>
<p>The cell immortalization and other tasks outlined in this notice are highly technical, and require extensive experience and expertise.  The success rate for cell immortalization is extremely variable.  It depends on how well the established methods are implemented, as well as on the quality and volume of the initial blood sample.  As the value of many genetics studies rests on the ability to analyze the DNA of relatives, inability to recover DNA from any particular sample may negate the value of multiple samples.  In addition, samples collected from pediatric patients may be very small, but valuable and irreplaceable.  Therefore, it is essential that the success rate for establishing cell lines be as close to 100% as possible.  Furthermore, the ability to track thousands of genetic samples, preventing sample mix-ups and cross-contamination while maintaining a high-throughput processing system, is crucial to the integrity of the studies being supported.  The Contractor's project director must have extensive experience in successfully providing these genetics and sample processing services, including blood cell immortalization and DNA extraction and distribution, to a large group of investigators.  The Contractor's staff must be highly trained to carry out exacting technical tasks accurately and reproducibly.  As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</strong>.</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement will be to continue the NIDDK Genetics Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:</p>
<p>&bull;	Receive blood samples from NIDDK funded grants</p>
<p>&bull;	Process these data and materials to create cell lines and DNA samples</p>
<p>&bull;	Receive externally produced immortalized lymphocyte cell lines; and</p>
<p>&bull;	Widely distribute all materials to qualified investigators in the scientific community in variety of customized formats</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.</strong></p>
<p>All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability must demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull;	Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;</p>
<p>&bull;	Establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository;</p>
<p>&bull;	Create and store viable cell lines via Epstein-Barr virus transformation of lymphocytes from blood samples, with a success rate of 98% or greater and expanding the lymphoblastoid cell lines;</p>
<p>&bull;	Receive and store lymphoblastoid cell lines prepared at other facilities and carry out quality control assessments;</p>
<p>&bull;	Extract and store DNA from cell lines, whole blood and, with designated samples, separate the white blood cells (buffy coat) from the plasma of received blood samples;</p>
<p>&bull;	Extract and store RNA from cell lines or from isolated blood cells;</p>
<p>&bull;	Carry out limited genotyping for verifying sample identity and quality;</p>
<p>&bull;	Distribute cell lines and biosamples to investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including arraying in a variety of formats, packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;</p>
<p>&bull;	Withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer;</p>
<p>&bull;	Establish and maintain Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery;</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking and reporting of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, seamless interaction with the Database Repository, and listing of investigators using the repository;</p>
<p>&bull;	Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, customers, and the Steering Committee.</p>
<p><strong><br />NIDDK BIOSAMPLE REPOSITORY.</strong></p>
<p>The NIDDK conducts and supports much of the clinical research on the diseases of internal medicine and related subspecialty fields.  Many of the large clinical studies funded by the NIDDK collect biospecimens from subjects for analysis and future study.  The collection of these patient and control samples from many different studies in a single repository is a valuable resource with which researchers can rapidly validate clinical hypotheses and algorithms for clinical decision. The collection is also advancing the development of prognostics, markers, and therapeutics for diseases related to the mission of the NIDDK.  This project, which will be referred to herein as "the Biosample Repository", continues an important collection begun in 2003 and is conceptually related to repositories in existence at other institutes at the NIH. The current contractor is Fisher Bioservices.</p>
<p>The repository stores and maintains biosamples under high quality conditions, and distributes them in an equitable and ethical manner.  This facilitates sharing of NIDDK-supported resources, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations, without excluding those who are established in their fields.  It helps to ensure that research participants make a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.</p>
<p>The specimen archiving tasks outlined in this notice are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment.  The samples were collected over many years from carefully chosen subjects and are present in a finite quantity.  Each sample is unique and cannot be replaced if lost, damaged, or contaminated.  Therefore, it is essential that the samples be stored under optimal conditions, which vary from sample type to sample type.  The Contractor's project director must have extensive experience in successful management of an archival storage facility that stores various types of biosamples, including blood, stool, urine, DNA, and tissue, and distributes aliquots to many different investigators.  The Contractor's staff must be highly trained to carry out technical tasks accurately and reproducibly.  As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract, and to prevent repeated shipment of samples from storage site to storage site, as shipment can sometimes damage these unique materials.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this requirement will be to continue the NIDDK Biosample Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:</p>
<p>&bull;	Receive and store biosamples collected in many different studies;</p>
<p>&bull;	Carry out specified sample processing and analyses, and</p>
<p>&bull;	Widely distribute biosamples to qualified investigators</p>
<p><br /><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.</strong></p>
<p>All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement must demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull;	Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;</p>
<p>&bull;	Establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository and for timely and cost-effective laboratory processing and/or testing of biosamples;</p>
<p>&bull;	Store biosamples under optimal conditions to minimize loss, damage or contamination;</p>
<p>&bull;	Distribute biosamples to qualified investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;</p>
<p>&bull;	Withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer;</p>
<p>&bull;	Establish and maintain Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery;</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain robust, flexible, high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, and listing of investigators using the repository;</p>
<p>&bull;	Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee and the Steering Committee.</p>

<DESC>Synoposis:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in February.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for February is February 1, 2015 to February 7, 2015, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2014 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the new RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   <br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and certain counties in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">February.</strong> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">HOW TO OFFER: </strong>The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the 'Open Period'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the 'Open Period'**. For assistance with the application, email AAAP.Manager@gsa.gov.</p>
<p>The Open Period for <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">February*</strong> is <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">February 1, 2016 to February 7, 2016*,</strong> ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Building/space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program November 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>** If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2015, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2016 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please be sure to review each page prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the 'Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your previous offered space will not be copied<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">OCCUPANCY: </strong>Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">DELINEATED AREA:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within Region 4</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227"><span style="COLOR: #1155cc">http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227</span></a>.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">LEASE TERM:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>Up to 10 years.</p>

<h2>Current Situation and Objectives</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: .25in 40.5pt 76.5pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mission of USAMRIID is to conduct basic and applied research on biological threats, resulting in medical solutions for the Soldier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The core competency of USAMRIID is working safely and securely with dangerous pathogens in biocontainment, using the unique laboratory facilities available in the institute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The state of the art in biological science and biodefense research increasingly incorporates and relies upon high-content data-generating instrumentation that enable biological systems to be examined in increasingly complex and comprehensive ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This instrumentation and the information technology which supports it represents a tremendous challenge in data management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, DoD security requirements are often incompatible with the software and operating systems required to operate the instruments and analyses, causing a decentralized operating environment where each lab contains many data silos. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The downstream effect of this is that scientists are burdened with integration of datasets from disparate functional areas, manual execution of downstream analyses and manual data management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The absence of an integrated network and information management system for instrumentation is having tangible and measurable impacts on the rate of progress of research and collaboration.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: .25in 40.5pt 76.5pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The execution of this proposal would create a system in which a project can be managed effectively across multiple functional areas, deliver workflow tasks to production scientists and technicians, report status and results to scientists and program managers, and reduce the amount of administrative burden on USAMRIID personnel so more resources can be spent executing research. Additionally, the tracking and reporting functionalities will be critical to certification standards like Good Laboratory Practice and the International Standards Organization and the portal dashboard interface will bring new tools for collaboration within the institute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The physical limitations of a secondary network are being addressed in two initiatives: research network intrinsic to the design for the new RIID facility and the research network pilot designed to cover the existing RIID facilities. We have also recently finished the cabling and hardware infrastructure requirements to connect the Genomics and Toxicology divisions later referred to as the pilot stakeholders for this project. The physical limitations of connectivity between the functional areas have been removed or are in the process of being removed but scientists are still burdened with integration of datasets from disparate functional areas, manual execution of downstream analyses and manual data management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<h2>Proposed System Overview</h2>

On the right is a representation of the physical infrastructure via different functional areas within the institute including but not limited to those presented. The containment suites represented here as a BSL-4 also include BSL-3 laboratories. In all cases each laboratory and or functional area will have organic computing assets and instrumentation connected via a research network to servers located currently at the NEC (Future location in the new RIID server room). The system will leverage the Information Services Office (ISO) initiative to provide a data backup plan for the research network.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: .25in 40.5pt 76.5pt 78.0pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The left side of the diagram represents the proposed software solution. The system will gather data from multiple disparate systems and transform the data and metadata into a common format for storage in a relational database. Additionally, the system will digitize notebook entries, gather data and run status information directly, provide analytical tools, provide customizable workflow, automate downstream analyses and provide sample management capabilities. It will be a dynamic and living electronic record reflecting ongoing research studies in real-time. Bio-Banking shown here should be a capability and not a requirement of the system. Through portal views, users of the system at this level will provide real-time access to direct and complete research. The views will be customized by roles and rights to provide granularity based on business requirements. Following this methodology project managers, division chiefs, auditors, command staff, etc will have access to the data across a functional area, project, or institute as directed by business requirements.</span></p>

<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). <br />Background:</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) operates eighteen (18) HC-144 aircraft. The HC-144 is manufactured by Airbus Military (formerly EADS CASA) based in Seville, Spain. The base CASA CN-235M aircraft provides the foundation for the HC-144. Changes to the base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235M, the USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft. It is powered by two General Electric CT7-9C3 turboprops which drive Hamilton Sundstrand 14RF-31 four-blade reverse-pitch propellers. The aircraft is specifically equipped to perform all USCG missions which include: search and rescue, maritime safety, security logistics, as well as national defense and protection of natural resources.<br />The aircraft is not currently equipped with any type of permanently installed vibration analysis monitoring equipment or structural health monitoring equipment.</p>
<p>USCG Objective:</p>
<p>USCG, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Medium Range Surveillance (MRS) Division, Elizabeth City, North Carolina is seeking to create the Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS). MRS is seeking sources that can offer a one system solution to monitor the aircraft flight data, the powerplant vibrations and the airframe structure loads. One USCG HC-144 aircraft will be configured with the HUMS to monitor airframe structural loads in addition to flight data and powerplant monitoring and one aircraft will be configured to monitor flight data and powerplant vibrations.<br />The HUMS shall be capable of operating as a standalone component on the aircraft and be able to provide a user interface capability for operation during aircraft operations. The HUMS shall be able to identify, monitor, and record discrepant conditions through the use of vibration analysis, and airframe structural loads analysis. The HUMS shall confirm or modify the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) maintenance requirement assumptions by incorporating condition based evaluation to ensure that the aircraft is optimally managed in a safe and cost-effective manner for the duration of the HC-144's operational life cycle.<br />The proposed HUMS shall be available from a commercial source and be sustainable for the next twenty (20) years. The Data Acquisition system should be able to acquire data received from the Powerplant, Airframe along with aircraft flight parameters and allow for easy data review. The system shall be capable of collecting data throughout all ground and flight profiles as well as data generated during the flight or ground runs such as but not limited to the following; engine speeds, air speed, location, altitude, etc. The data shall be recorded and easily removed for collection and evaluation on a standalone computer using source supplied and licensed software.<br />The proposed HUMS shall indicate an out of balance propeller, compute balance corrections, and provided solutions to balance the GE supplied CT7-9C3 engine, gearbox, and propeller system during engine operations. The HUMS shall offer balancing solutions using a proven method that shall meet GE and OEM standards. The HUMS shall monitor and detect out of balance power plant conditions to include vibration magnitude, phase angle and calculate propeller balance solutions.<br />The proposed HUMS shall record structural load inputs, and analyze the data for comparison to the OEMs engineering data. The HUMS shall monitor, record, and detect airframe structural loads incurred during variable flight profiles, conditions and environments. The HUMS shall collect technical and performance data and use it to analyze aircraft usage data along with airframe structural loads and power plant vibrations. The HUMS shall compare OEM design criteria with actual usage to determine the rate of structural fatigue life consumption and to suggest changes to OEM maintenance criteria if required.<br />The source shall be responsible for obtaining OEM proprietary information to include but not limited to life cycles and maintenance scheduling.</p>
<p><br />The information obtained shall be used to determine the benefits of installing HUMS on the entire fleet of aircraft.</p>
<p>Responders shall provide the following but not limited to:<br />Technical data, to include input/output <br />Efficiency<br />Operating parameters<br />Size and weight <br />Method of securing<br />Mean Time Between Failure data<br />Availability<br />Sustainability requirements<br />Data review methods<br />Number of collection channels for accelerometers<br />Number of collection channels for magnetic pickups <br />Number of collection channels for strain/stress gauges<br />Location of accelerometers, magnetic pickups, and strain gauges<br />Rough Order of Magnitude<br />Ability to produce final acceptance test plans for the HUMS</p>
<p>REPLIES:<br />All companies that can provide the services are encouraged to provide a capability statement for providing the equipment, software, installation, vibration analysis, and knowledge of airframe structural loads analysis, cage code, brochures, or any other information demonstrating that they can provide these services. Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, and point of contact (POC).

<DESC>SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION
FAR SUBPARTS 5.1 & 5.2

Contract / Modification No:  DE-EM0003561/ Modification 0003
Procurement Type:  Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract Modification (Special Notice) 
Classification Code: R - Professional, Administrative and Management Support
NAICS Code: 541690 Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services
Title:  Extend the Period of Performance for VMEP contract
Description:  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, to Longenecker & Associates, Inc. located in Las Vegas, NV.  
The original requirement was procured through ORP?s tank farms contract with Washington River Protection Solutions (WRPS). In March 2015, the contract was assigned and taken over by DOE/ORP. The contract required a Vapor Management Expert Panel (VMEP) be established to help provide assurance to the Department of Energy/Office of River Protection (ORP) that actions committed to following the Tank Vapor Assessment Team?s (TVAT) report and actions resulting from any new, emergent issues are being carried out and effective in protecting workers from potential vapor exposures. This proposed contract action (Contract DE-EM0003591, Modification No. 0003) will extend the current period of performance set to expire on February 29, 2016 until September 30, 2016. Funds will also be added to cover the expenses during this additional timeframe.
Longenecker & Associates has an experienced and knowledgeable staff in tank vapor management and has assembled an excellent team to provide oversight in support of DOE during Phase I of the Tank Vapor Assessment Team (TVMP) Implementation Plan (IP). This will enable safely proceeding with effective, efficient and timely efforts to manage and remove wastes from the Hanford Tank Farms. DOE-ORP previously determined that Longenecker & Associates is the only contractor that has the capability to perform the contract; likewise, Longenecker & Associates is also determined to be the only contractor uniquely capable of performing these additional in-scope services without disruption to the EM mission.  The current time and materials price of the contract is $465,738.50, and the contract modification is expected to increase the time & materials price by approximately $500,000.  
For questions or comments regarding this proposed contract action, contact Robert Burrier, Contract Specialist, US DOE Office of River Protection, Richland WA, at robert_l_burrier@orp.doe.gov.

<DESC>The Washington Office - AQM - Job Corps Support Branch intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to The Cherokee Boys Club Inc., for monthly refuse and cardboard removal services to be performed at the Oconaluftee Job Corps Center, located in Cherokee, North Carolina. This is for weekly pickup and proper disposal of cardboard, recycles and trash at the Oconaluftee Job Corps Center which is Federal Government Property, and are used to service the Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Center. <br /><br />A determination not to compete this proposed contract was made pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1 (b)(1), Soliciting from a Single Source, and FAR 13.501 (a), for purchases not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract deem only one source reasonably available. The Cherokee Boys Club, Inc., has been identified through Market Research as the only vendor in the local commuting area that is capable of providing refuse and cardboard removal services on the Oconaluftee Job Corps Center.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to modify the existing contract 263010050/HHSH250201200003W, with the SRA, International, Inc. 4300 Fair Lakes Court, Fairfax, Virginia 220334-4232, to add the following IT Security related tasks: 1) Security Initiatives Support, 2) New Day Compliance Initiatives Support, and 3) System Testing to support the Security Initiatives and New Day Compliance Initiatives. This proposed work will develop secure IT infrastructure to leverage HRSA's significant national security, IT, and cybersecurity expertise, incorporating security into the fundamental design of the systems, strengthening the security of the data environment and providing robust privacy protections. These changes will help the National Practitioner DataBank (NPDB) system stay ahead of currently known cyber threats and minimize program risk.<br />Specifically, the required security related initiative support is to 1) Replace a legacy Fraud Detection Service (FDS) solution, 2) Implement the HHS Access Management Service (AMS) integration initiative, 3) Implement an anticipated second factor authentication initiative, 4) Implement an antivirus capability to scan files, 5) Enhance the NPDB website encrypted communications and secure connections, 6) System architectural changes, and 7) Additional high priority POA&amp;M tasks and OIT mandated security priorities. New Day Compliance Initiatives are needed to create new business processes and enhancements and to perform the appropriate system testing for the security initiatives and the new day compliance initiatives. <br />This notice is provided pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR part 6.302-1: the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A competitive procurement conducted in 2011 resulted in SRA as the successful offeror. Negotiations with the SRA, Intl. for this modification will result in a more secure IT system benefitting all those whose names and information in this databank. <br />The contractor SRA International Inc. has proprietary knowledge and experience with the NPDB project no other company can provide these services of this modification more efficiently and effectively, because SRA has successfully performed the contract for the last twenty (20) years, which accrues to the benefit of the Government. Due to the difficult learning curve effect, a different contractor would have to perform a significant amount of rework to catch up in order to perform the required work. Using any another contractor is not acceptable because of delay of service and the duplication would create many inefficiencies and it would cost the Government time, and additional funding which would increase project and program cost, lengthen the schedule, and raise performance risks. The additional cost and delay in the program is not anticipated to be recovered through competition. <br />The intent of this notice is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to solicit competitive offers. The proposed contract modification/action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interest offerors may submit their capabilities or responses before the closing date and time of this notice to the Government for considerations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Any written inquiries must reference the contract number, 263010050/HHSH250201200003W and be addressed to Mario Checchia at mchecchia@hrsa.gov by 2:00pm Feb 12, 2016. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.<br />

<p><br />Notice Type: <br />Special Notice</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division entered into a $7,900,000.00 Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Armtec Countermeasures Company, 85901 Avenue 53, Coachella, CA, 92236 on 07 AUG 2013. The place of performance is East Camden, AR. The scope of the original BOA was to purchase Airborne Expendable Countermeasures (AECMs), specifically the ARM-008, ARM-017, ARM-022, MJU-71/B, and MJU-59/B. This synopsis covers pending modification P00002 for an increase in scope and an increase in BOA ceiling. The scope increase covers the procurement of other AECMs to include: MJU-64/B, MJU-67/B, M216E4, and M216E5 decoys. The Government intends to increase the ceiling by $20,000,000.00 to $27,900,000.00. The AECMs are needed for evaluation, qualification, and effectiveness testing, as well as potential fleet use. The period of the BOA remains at five years. Periodic reviews and synopses of BOA Job Orders will be performed by NSWC Crane. Individual Job Orders will specify requirements and all applicable delivery terms and conditions. A solicitation for the pending BOA modification will not be issued. No hard copies of the solicitation or BOA will be mailed. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency. Contact Michelle Amos, Code 024 via e-mail: michelle.amos@navy.mil or by mail. The complete mailing address is: Ms. Michelle Amos, Code 024, Bldg. 121, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane IN 47522-5001. Reference the above BOA number when responding to this notice.</p>
<p>This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) (a) (2) (iii) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The basis for restricting competition is that Armtec Countermeasures Company designed, developed and manufactures the flares and holds key technical data, drawings and production rights unique to these decoys. Establishing alternative sources will result in unacceptable duplicative costs attempting to reverse engineer any flares.</p>

<div>2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What, if anything, can be changed to improve the SOW?</div>
<div>3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>How much would it cost to perform this work and achieve all the results in the SOW? &nbsp;We are looking for a ballpark figure or a range as part of our market research to help prepare our cost estimate. &nbsp;Please note that the figure in USAID&rsquo;s Business Forecast is only a place-holder and not indicative of this work.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is an RFI and not a Request for Proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to issue any solicitation or to pay for any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of comments on this RFI. &nbsp;Please do not prepare a proposal in response to this RFI, especially with regards to answering question number 3, as we&rsquo;re only looking for a ballpark figure or range.</div>

<div>To expedite our review and be considerate of your time, please keep responses to no more than 5 pages in length if possible. &nbsp;Responses to the RFI must be written in English, and use 11pt font. &nbsp;Please number each page consecutively.</div>

The agenda for the Industry Day will likely include a General Session along with narrowly defined 1-on-1 sessions.  This is anticipated to be a 1-2 day event scheduled from 8:00am EST - 5:00pm EST each day.  

To assist VA in gauging industry's level of interest for such an event, it is requested that interested parties send an email to Peter Lewandowski, Contract Specialist, at Peter.Lewandowski@va.gov no later than 5:00pm EST on 02/05/2016 indicating the company name, contact information, anticipated number of attendees, and the company's business size, including applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s).  Interested parties should also indicate whether they would prefer an option to attend the conference virtually, if that option is offered.  

VA has attached brief slide deck about the Community Care Program.  Interested parties are encouraged to review the documentation and submit questions and comments in advance of the Industry Day.  VA will address questions and comments either at the Industry Day or in future updates to this announcement, as appropriate.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment.

Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<p><br /><strong>C. IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong></p>
<p>1. This purchase order is governed, insofar as applicable, by the procedures set forth in</p>
<p>FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items &amp; <br /><br />FAR 13.106-2(b) -- Evaluation of Quotations or Offers <br />(b) Evaluation procedures.<br />(1) The contracting officer has broad discretion in fashioning suitable evaluation procedures.<br />(3) If using price and other factors, ensure that quotations or offers can be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion. Formal evaluation plans and establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, and scoring quotations or offers are not required. Contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers.</p>
<p>Submission of a proposal in response to this RFP constitutes the offeror's express acknowledgment to that effect. All other procedures are at the sole discretion of the Government as set forth in this RFP.</p>
<p>2. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a purchase order without discussions. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms. Unclear proposals may not result in questions for clarifications. Proposals with an omission or unclear proposals may be judged to mean the contractor does not fully understand the requirements or understand what it takes to meet or exceed the requirements, regardless of the proposed cost/price. In that case, the offeror may be found unacceptable and ineligible for award. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government reserves the right to make award with or without discussions or exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>D. Additional Information</strong>:</p>
<p>Please email any questions you may have regarding this effort to bruce.e.hayes@usace.army.mil and the Contracting Officer will coordinate a response. All questions must be received no later than <strong>12 February 2016</strong> @ 2:00PM (1400) Eastern Standard Time.</p>
<p>Questions directly to the Contracting Officer's Representative are prohibited. If you have any procedural questions, please contact the Contract Specialist, Mr. Bruce Hayes at bruce.e.hayes@usace.army.mil.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>AWARD AND EVALUATION INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>A. BASIS FOR AWARD</strong></p>
<p>Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. The two evaluation factors that will be used in determining the most beneficial proposal to the government are: Cost/Price and Experience. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for the experience factor. Price will be the most significant factor in consideration of award. Tradeoffs are not permitted. Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but are not ranked using the non-cost/price factors.</p>
<p><strong>B. FACTORS TO BE EVALUATED</strong></p>
<p>1. COST/PRICE<br /><br />2. EXPERIENCE</p>
<p><br /><strong>C. EVALUATION APPROACH</strong></p>
<p>1. COST/PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH:<br />The Government will evaluate price by adding the total of all prices, including all options. Pricing shall be in accordance with the CLIN structure detailed in Section B "Supplies or Services and Pricing" of the RFP. Further breakdown of each line item may be requested during evaluations to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>2. EXPERIENCE EVALUATION APPROACH <br />Experience will be determined by the relevant narratives/returns the contractor provides describing the contractor's ability to repair large steel impellers within the past 5 years. If no Experience information is received from the offeror, the offeror will not be considered for this award and will be deemed as non-responsive.</p>
<p><br /><strong>D. DEFINITIONS</strong> <br /><br />Experience - The experience rating will be expressed as an adjectival assessment of acceptable or unacceptable.</p>
<p>a. Acceptable - Based on the offeror's provided experience narrative, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the requirement. If no information on the required experience is received from the offeror, they will receive an unacceptable rating. Due to the specialized nature of the work described in the SOW/PWS, it is necessary that the Offeror demonstrate satisfactory completion of repairs to large steel impellers. Rebuilding of the impellers is a specialized task that can cause potential loss to the Government should the impellers become warped or cracked due to improper repairs. Low to Moderate Performance Risk.</p>
<p>b. Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's experience narrative, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the requirement. Vendor has not met the experience levels described herein on similar jobs, on-site government personnel have had multiple negative experiences with the vendor's personnel, and customers the vendor provided as evidence of similar/like work were unsatisfied with overall vendor performance on similar jobs. - High Performance Risk.</p>
<p><br /><strong>E. AWARD</strong> <br /><br />Award will be made to the lowest priced offer that meets or exceeds the required experience as specified in this ITO.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting<br />`more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:</p>
<p>(i) warrants;</p>
<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>

All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>
<p>(b) Change Request Process will occur in the following order:</p>
<p>1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COR . <br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Change Request- CR and IGE are generated by the COR and entered in the Contract Workbook. COR will assign the Change request number.<br />4.

Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Change Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COR by the KO</p>
<p>Change Request must be submitted by the COR to the contractor within 24 hours after responding to the CFR. Contractor must submit proposal to the Contracting Officer within 72 hours receipt of the Change Request.</p>
<p>A modification will be issued to incorporate and implement all changes made by change orders.</p>
<p><br />9. CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong><br />Executive Director (Perspective Planning)<br />Room No 152-C, Rail Bhavan, Railway Board, Raisina Road<br />New Delhi India Pin-110001<br /><br />
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance that will assist the Grantee to develop new, and modify existing, leasing and public private partnership (PPP) frameworks to attract private sector funding for India's rail network.  The TA will assess the specific practices and the financial benefits that the Grantee could achieve by: 1) leasing its railway lines to licensed, private operators; 2) similarly leasing a greater number of its movable assets like locomotives and wagons; and 3) improving its current contract terms with concessionaires and lessors. The TA includes review of the Grantee's current five-year plan and analysis of a variety of methods the Grantee, Ministry of Railways of the Republic of India ("IR"), could employ private capital to improve its operations and rail infrastructure.  The TA will also recommend a training program for Grantee officials.</p>
<p>For India to maintain its needed economic growth it is critical that it invest heavily in infrastructure.  Currently the country's economy is not generating the investment funds required.  In the case of the Grantee this problem is made more difficult because as a government owned entity it is not only required to source funds for infrastructure, it has been required to source funds for locomotives, coaches, and wagons.  <br /> <br /> At a May 2, 2013 meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways it was suggested that the Grantee take concrete steps to ensure that PPP achievements do not lag behind targets. The report suggests that mobilization of private investment in the Grantee is likely to be roughly four percent, which is less when compared to the private capital share in other sectors like ports (80 percent), telecom (82 percent), electricity (44 percent), airports (64 percent) and roads (16 percent).  By comparison the North American railways are privately owned, almost all movable assets of any value are purchased by shippers and leasing companies.  Many terminals are owned or leased by private companies and not by the operating main line railways.</p>
<p>As a means of access to private funding, in 1986 the Grantee created a subsidiary corporation, Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC) that is authorized to annually borrow up to 9,000 Cr ($1.8 billion) from the private market.  IRFC is a dedicated financing arm of the Ministry of Railways. Its sole objective is to raise money from the market to part finance outlay of the Grantee's annual plan. The money so made available is used for acquisition of rolling stock assets and for meeting other developmental needs of the Grantee.  Since IRFC can offer a sovereign guarantee it can attract funds at lower interest rates.  This money is then lent in the form of leases of assets to the railway.  These funds are lent with a 0.5 percent interest rate premium to fund the Corporation.  For 15 to 20 years the Grantee has tried to attract private capital to fund supply of freight wagons by issuing schemes and rules under which private ownership would be permitted.  While these programs exist, the Grantee is interested to learn what modifications and international best practices could enhance the amount of private capital that the Grantee is able to attract to support its infrastructure investment requirements.   Portions of a background Definitional Mission are provided for reference in Annex 2.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $518,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</span></strong><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1500 hours IST, March 12, 2016</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

        (B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:  commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);
        (C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and
        (D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
          (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
            (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
            (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
          (2) Examples.
            (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
            (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
            (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
            (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
            (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
    (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
  THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.
  (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
  (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation.  However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility.  Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
  (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision.  The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
  (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.  If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.
(End of Provision)

D.3 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
"	Technical Capability will outweigh Past Performance, Price and experience
"	Past Performance will outweigh Price and Experience
"	Experience will outweigh Price
"	Price is the final consideration

     Technical and past performance, when combined, are of greater importance than price.
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Any data delivered under the resulting contract will be subject to the Rights in Data-General clause at 52.227-14 included in this contract. Under the latter clause, a Contractor may withhold from delivery data that qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software, and deliver form, fit, and function data instead. The latter clause also may be used with its Alternates II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted rights notices, as appropriate. In addition, use of Alternate V with this latter clause provides the Government the right to inspect such data at the Contractor's facility.
    (b) By completing the remainder of this paragraph, the offeror represents that it has reviewed the requirements for the delivery of technical data or computer software and states [offeror check appropriate block]-
    [  ] None of the data proposed for fulfilling the data delivery requirements qualifies as limited rights data or restricted computer software; or
    [  ] Data proposed for fulfilling the data delivery requirements qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software and are identified as follows:
____________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________
    (c) Any identification of limited rights data or restricted computer software in the offeror's response is not determinative of the status of the data should a contract be awarded to the offeror.

  (a) It is in the best interest of the Government to avoid situations which might create an organizational conflict of interest or where the offeror's performance of work under the contract may provide the contractor with an unfair competitive advantage. The term "organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the person has an unfair competitive advantage.

  (c) Based on this information and any other information solicited or obtained by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists which would warrant disqualifying the contractor for award of the contract unless the organizational conflict of interest can be mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction by negotiating terms and conditions of the contract to that effect. If the conflict of interest cannot be mitigated and if the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract, the contracting officer shall request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 and 48 CFR 809.503.
  (d) Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest at the time of the offer, or arising as a result of a modification to the contract, may result in the termination of the contract at no expense to the Government.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with relevant programming, to provide support and guidance for country program staff to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI program activities in the field.</p>
<p>OTI's success now and in the future depends in large part on its ability to achieve an overarching organizational goal: the effective transfer and ongoing analysis of knowledge and experience - comprised of values, management processes, lessons learned, best practices, standards, and innovations - in real time, with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include: OTI staff in the field and headquarters; OTI's implementing partners around the world; USAID Missions overseas; other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington; other U.S. Government agencies and branches; other donors; other transition, stabilization and reconstruction practitioners; host government and/or other local counterparts; and the U.S. public. All of the above increases OTI's level of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>The CVE Specialist supports OTI programs by supporting the knowledge, skills and abilities of OTI staff to apply best practices and lessons learned in CVE programming. The CVE Specialist does this by: identifying innovative solutions that are adapted and relevant to OTI's fast-paced global needs; contributing to learning and training events and products; providing support services ranging from procurement to linkages with private sector partners; and liaising with key interagency stakeholders to influence policy and represent OTI CVE programming. ABC supports learning and innovation through the application of technology - including OTI's knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools - to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance. ABC coordinates closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items apply to this acquisition</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>a. The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Price</p>
<p>Past Performance is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the Government is conducting a (best value) between price and past performance of quotes and past performance being signicantly more important than price. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price Evaluation. Initially, quoters shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price (TEP).</p>
<p>2. Past Performance.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of quoter's performance deemed recent and relevant to the requirements of this Request for Quote (RFQ). The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the acquisition.</p>
<p>1) All past performance will be assessed on recency. Recent past performance is defined as past performance on contracts within the last three (3) years from the closing date of this solicitation. Past performance not considered recent will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>2) Quoters will be evaluated on relevancy. Using questionnaires and information submitted under Addenda to FAR 52.212-1, Quote Preparation Instruction, Part II, Past Performance, the Contracting Officer (CO) shall seek relevant performance information on all quoters based on (1) the present/past references provided by the quoter and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources as well as past performance questionnaires. Relevant performance is determined as manufacturing bathrobes supporting at a minimum, 1,000 customers or more a year to include other type of outerwear (for example, flight suits, coveralls) involving similar or greater scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Relevancy Ratings<br />Rating Definition</p>
<p>RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>SOMEWHAT RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p><br />NOT RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>3) A quality rating will be given for each past performance reference identified by the Government. Quality ratings are based on the following definitions:</p>
<p>E VG S M U N/A<br />Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory Not Applicable <br />The contractor met and exceeded many of the requirements of the contract and consistently performed at a superior level. Performance was accomplished with very few minor problems, and the contractor took immediate and effective corrective actions for those problems that did occur.<br />The contractor met and exceeded some of the requirements of the contract and consistently performed very well. Performance was accomplished with some minor problems, and the contractor took timely and effective corrective action for those problems that did occur The contractor met the requirements of the contract and consistently performed at an acceptable level. Performance was accomplished with some problems, and the contractor took effective corrective action for those problems that did occur The contractor did not always meet some of the requirements of the contract and intervention was required to continue performance. There were instances where performance was at a less than acceptable level; performance was accomplished with some problems and some corrective actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented The contractor did not meet the requirements of the contract and performance was at an unacceptable level. There were a number of serious problems that required extensive oversight and involvement, and corrective actions were either ineffective or non-existent.<br />Unable to provide a rating. Contract did not include performance for this aspect, or information is not available. Do not know.</p>
<p><br />4) The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government has in the vendor's ability to provide services that meet the requirements outlined in this solicitation using the vendor's demonstrated record of performance. Recency, relevancy and quality ratings for the evaluated past performance citations will be integrated to determine an overall confidence assessment rating. This process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in the DoD Source Selection Procedures, Table 5, Performance Confidence Assessments. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal quoter. Quoters with no relevant past or present performance history or the vendor's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably (neutral).</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS<br />Rating Description<br />SUBSTANTIAL<br />CONFIDENCE Based on the quoter's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort.<br />SATISFACTORY<br />CONFIDENCE Based on the quoter's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort<br />LIMITED CONFIDENCE Based on the vendor's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort.<br />NO CONFIDENCE Based on the vendor's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the vendor will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE<br />(NEUTRAL) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the vendor's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>5) Vendors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quote preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Quoters may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past performance information to which the quoter has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources with a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the CO reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for Quote revision.</p>
<p>6) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating, that Quote represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>7) In the event that the government does not make an award pursuant to paragraph 6 above, the government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance assessment rating of "Substantial Confidence" or lower. In that event, the source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As this requirement will be an unrestricted, competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website.&nbsp; In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access.&nbsp; The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible.&nbsp; Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1.&nbsp;Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.&nbsp; For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk.&nbsp; Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2.&nbsp;Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in.&nbsp; Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system.&nbsp; For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3.&nbsp;After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">4.&nbsp;Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.&nbsp; The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.&nbsp; If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk.&nbsp; Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">a)&nbsp;The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br /> b)&nbsp;The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button.&nbsp; Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system.&nbsp; Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Pre-proposal Conference will be held at U.S. Army Garrison West Point on October 19, 2015. The Water and Wastewater utility systems Site Visits will be held from October 21-22, 2015.</strong></p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS<br /><br />Q1. Please verify the bonding requirement for this project
<p>a. Bid bond in the amount of ___% of bid</p>
<p>b. Payment and Performance bond in the amount of 100% of bid, per Section I 1.2 <br />(a).</p>
<p><em>a. See SF1442; Section 13.b. Offer guarantee is not required.<br />b. Alternate Payment Protections (FAR 52.228-13) are required as indicated in Section I.2 and M.3 BONDING REQUIREMENTS.</em></p>
<p>Q2. We are checking the expected duration of lead times for the fuel oil tank and accessories. If lead time directly impacts the 90-day completion requirement will the Government allow for an extension of project completion to accommodate the lead time?</p>
<p><em>A. The estimate of time was with a 6 week lead time in ordering the tank. If the tank takes more than 8 weeks lead time, then yes an increase in time may need to be negotiated and approved in writing by Contracting Officer.</em></p>
<p>Q3. Is the existing temporary tank sitting in the position of the new tank? If so can it be relocated for the new tank to be installed with minimal impact to the operation of the clinic or should we anticipate temporary relocation of temporary tank?</p>
<p><em>A. Yes, the small existing, rental tank is in the location for the new tank. It is anticipated that the Contractor will provide a means of temporary fuel tank and fuel so the clinic can remain operation during time of construction of the new tank. See specification section 01011 3.1. Coordination with the COR will be required in timing of removal of the small USCG rental tank and the contractor supplied temporary tank.</em></p>
<p>Q4. S-4045 sheet note 1 is indicating the USCG will be removing the existing fuel tank, prior to start of work. Should we be planning on coordinating this effort to minimize the boilers "off time" or is some other plan in effect?</p>
<p><em>A. Coordination between the Contractor, COR, and Base Ketchikan for the timing of the removal of Rental Tank is required to minimize any down time for the Base Clinic.</em></p>
<p>Q5. S-4045 sheet note 1 indicates "coordinate with USCG Ketchikan base for fill of oil tank at completion of work". Can we assume that the cost of filling of the fuel tank is the USCG responsibility?</p>
<p><em>A. Cost of filling the new fuel oil tank, at the end of the project will be the responsibility of USCG. Timing of the fill will need to be coordinated between the Contractor, the COR, and Base Ketchikan.</em></p>
<p>Q6. Has the abandoned underground fuel piping shown on S-4045 detail 2 noting required "capping" been actively used recently? Sheet notes imply that current (piping being used) is above ground and is to be removed and replaced with new. We are trying to establish if the underground piping could contain fuel and if we are responsible for removal of the fuel potentially contained within that piping.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>A.</em> <em>The piping has been abandoned for awhile, and fuel lines just crimped over, not properly capped. Intent is to provide a proper capping of the abandoned underground conduit and piping. There is not oil in the abandoned lines. The fuel line in operation is above ground fuel oil piping. </em></p>
<p>Q7. Will you please confirm whether or not there is any new concrete work intended in this solicitation. The drawings indicate all concrete is existing yet you have a spec section that would indicate we have new concrete work either for a dike or mounting slab.</p>
<p><em>A. Anchoring the tank to an existing pad. No new concrete work.</em></p>
<p>Q8. <br />a. Is this a follow-on requirement? <strong>NO</strong>&nbsp;If so, could you please provide the incumbent contract number for this opportunity?<br />b. If not, is this a new requirement? <strong>YES</strong></p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<p>Notice Type: <br />Modification/Amendment</p>
<p>Synopsis:<br />Reference is made to the December 22, 2015, announcement, reference number 2016-31001A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data for the CEPALCO Scaled Implementation of AMI Pilot Project.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries as to whether only U.S. citizens may be proposed for the project.  In response, USTDA would respectfully refer Offerors to USTDA's Nationality Requirements listed in Annex 3 of the RFP.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries regarding the number of users included in the pilot project.  In response, the Grantee's AMI pilot project will cover approximately 2,000 of its customers or users.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries as to the type of customers where the pilot will be applied.  In response, out of the 2,000 customers, 14 will be bulk power customers (those that are metered at 69 kV or 138 kV through voltage and current sensors), 297 industrial customers, 689 commercial customers, and 1,000 residential customers.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries regarding the areas in which the pilot will be applied.  In response, the customer mix mentioned above is dispersed throughout the franchise area of the Grantee. For residential customers, the intention is to test what communications system ("last mile" solution) is best suited for the Grantee in its entire franchise area, i.e., representative residential customers within the rural, sub-urban, and urban areas.</p>
<p>USTDA is making this information available for the benefit of all prospective bidders. The response date for this RFP remains 4:00 PM local (Philippines) time on February 15, 2016.</p>

<DESC>**CANCELLED**<br /><br />The US Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Directorate, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent Division (AFNWC/NIC) is contemplating a sole source award(s) to potentially all prospective prime contractors who anticipate submitting a formal proposal for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contract.
<p>AFNWC/NIC continues to engage with industry and has been conducting extensive market research since FY14. This research aids in understanding industry's capabilities and developing the GBSD acquisition strategy and key TMRR documents. The TMRR objective is to conclude with a preliminary design and functional baseline leading up to a competition for the development/production phase. AFNWC/NIC is now seeking to enter into sole source contracts with potential future GBSD prime TMRR contractors to accelerate maturation of documentation and methodologies for communication between potential Prime Contractors and the System Program Office. This will provide the program management team with the ability to manage budget expectations with contract scope and streamline the dissemination of information, specifically regarding the sharing of classified materials. The expected period of performance will be a three (3) month base period and approximately three (3) one-month options.</p>
<p>No agreements, promises or other commitments are made or implied by the Government. The Government is not responsible or liable for expenditures incurred as the result of this posting.</p>
<p>Please respond via email to the POC below with your intentions to submit a proposal for the GBSD TMRR request for proposal along with your interest in a short term contract to evaluate and analyze specific requirements documents NLT Thursday, 5 November 2015 at 1400 MST.</p>

<CONTACT>Vandendries, Christie
<DESC>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office requires a contractor to operate a government furnished Sutter 500 trail dozer for the construction of approximately 5,900 linear feet of full-bench cuts, at 5 separate locations along the Copper Lake Trail. The work will also include training approximately 2 permanent government employees on safe and effective operation of the Sutter 500 with the goal of the trainees being capable of safely and effectively operating the equipment in conditions that are typical in nature and non-complex (i.e. low slopes).  A government-owned mini-excavator will also be available for the contractor use as conditions warrant.  Work will begin after July 15, 2016, and will require at least 2 separate mobilizations to the site. All work must be completed by October 15, 2016. Given potential variations in seasonal weather patterns, it is possible that work may be stopped for periods of time to allow the soils to dry.  Contract work will be coordinated with government trail crews working on the same trail.

, SEATTLE , WA 98108-4002 US
<DESC><p>This actual contract award number is FA8625-16-C-6599. An "A" was included in the contract number in this notice due to technical difficulties.</p>
<p>The Boeing Company has been awarded a cost plus fixed fee contract for Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization Program Phase 1 Pre-Milestone B Activities. Contractor will conduct activities aimed at improving affordability and reducing program execution risk. These activities will include the definition of detailed requirements and design trade-offs required to support informed decisions. These will lead to a lower-risk engineering and manufacturing development program and lower life cycle costs.<br /><br />This contract is being awarded on a sole-source basis. As the designer and manufacturer of the commercial 747-8 aircraft, The Boeing Company has the unique capability to perform necessary tasks to provide a Presidential aircraft. Boeing is also uniquely capable of satisfying all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification requirements with the highest confidence to meet the established program operational need date. This unique capability is based on Boeing's exclusively private development of the aircraft and sole ownership of the 747-8 aircraft stress, loads, and aero design data. Boeing declined to sell or otherwise provide the United States Government or other contractors the license rights needed to conduct an adequate competition or to provide additional engineering services in lieu of data rights.</p>
<p>The nature of the effort needed to meet PAR Program requirements is such that a non-Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) attempting the extensive modifications required for a Boeing 747-8 aircraft to meet PAR Program requirements would face significant challenges in securing required FAA Supplemental Type Certificates (STC) without availability of OEM technical data and technical support. Without the OEM's technical data and technical support, a non-OEM would be responsible for generating and recreating basic aircraft technical design data. The FAA would require a significant amount of proof in terms of data development, compliance methodology, and reverse-engineering type design data needed to substantiate and certify the modifications required for the PAR Program. Non-OEM reverse engineering type design data introduces significant cost and schedule risk into this program, which would jeopardize having an initial operating capability by 2024.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
695-16-1-133-0644	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$7,900.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:


Annual Preventative Maintenance of Medtronic O-Arm Imagining System
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:


Medtronic USA, INC., is the manufacturer of the server and the only vendor authorized to service the O-Arm system.
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  

Medtronic USA, INC.is the only vendor that is authorized to service the O-Arm Imagining System located at the Madison VA Hospital.  

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Results of Market Research show there is no other source able to provide the service needed to meet the government's need. Previous procurement research found a similar service has been procured in NCO 12 as an open-market, sole-source contract awarded to Medtronic USA, INC. 

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
