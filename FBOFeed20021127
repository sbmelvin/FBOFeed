<ARCHDATE>03312003
<CONTACT>ERIC VOKT, 435-831-2107
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Contracting Agency  Dugway Proving Ground is soliciting for the privatization of utility systems (electric, water and wastewater) at U.S. Army, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.   Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsi bility for operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades and future utility system replacements. The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under 10 USC 2688. It imposes certain economic tests that must be met prior to  award of a contract(s). The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and any other incidental services for the comple te ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvements to these utility systems. The Contractor(s) will be required to manage, control and perform its operations, maintenance, repairs, replacements and incidentals of its utility system(s) to provide firm, reliable and dependable utility service to each Government or tenant connection within the service area 24 hours each and every day. The utility systems will be conveyed by way of a Bill of Sale upon award of contract(s) and real property interests will be conveyed in the form of Easements. The Contractor(s) proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon decision to award. The Government anticipates awarding a Fixed-Price with Prospective Price Redetermination Utility Services Co ntract(s) for a term of 50 years to the Best Value offeror(s). The ability to award individual systems to individual firms will exist. This requirement is unrestricted.  The solicitation is DABJ19-03-R-0004. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: Dugway Proving Ground currently purchases wholesale electric power at 46-kV from Utah Power & Light Company (UP&L) at a single primary delivery point near the English Village area. The DPG electric distribution system is curr ently Army owned and consists of: (1) Three 46-kV distribution substations, (2) Approximately 10 circuit-miles of 46-kV transmission line, (3) Approximately 73 circuit-miles of 12.5-kV overhead primary distribution line, and (4) Approximately 9 circuit-mil es of 12.5-kV underground primary distribution line. The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (wood pole, open wire) with pole-mounted transformer banks. There is a relatively small amount of underground primary. Cu rrent peak loads approximate 3.5 megawatts with a fairly consistent year-round and around the clock loading. The system appears to be in quite good condition and individual meters are currently located within most of the housing area. POTABLE WATER SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The water treatment and distribution system comprises mains, service lateral lines, main valves, fire and yard hydrants, back flow preventors, and steel elevated and ground storage tanks. The distribution system is primari ly cast iron piping. The water system consists of three independent subsystems. The first system serves English Village; the second system serves Ditto Technical Center, Avery Technical Center, Baker Lab Area, and Michael Army Airfield; the third system is  for the Carr Complex. Operation and maintenance has been provided for several years by a base O&M contract. Two separate non-potable water systems provide irrigation water for English Village area: one for the golf course south of Stark Road, the other fo r the main containment area north of Stark Road. WASTEWATER SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The wastewater collection and treatment systems at DPG consist of four independent systems. The first serves English Village; the second serves Ditto, Avery, and Michael Army Airfield; the third serves Baker Lab; and the four th serves the Carr complex. In all areas, the collection systems are a combination of gravity and force mains with lift or pumping stations. Sizes of the collection mains range from 6 to 15 inches. Generally, all systems were installed between 1942 and the early 1950 s, though some upgrades have been completed. There are approximately 82,000 lineal feet of wastewater collection mains and 196 manholes within the English Vill age/Fries Park Complex. The most common pipe size is 8 inches, comprising nearly half of the collection system. DPG completed a new headworks and lagoon system in 1996 to service the English Village and Fries Park area. The headworks consists of a weir, a 3 HP comminutor rated at 1 MGD, flow-measurement sensor, manual bar screen, and a 6-inch Partial flume. Three lagoon cells, each with a rating a 5 mil lion gallons, have a minimum detention of 12.5 days. Maximum sludge deposition is one foot, and water dep th is six feet with a freeboard of three feet. Each cell is equipped with floating mechanical aerators. Cell 1 and 4 aerators (2 @ 20 HP and 2 @ 15 HP) . Cell 2 has 4 aerators @ 5 HP each. Cell 3 has 2 aerators @ 5 HP each. The chlorine scrubber, cathodic test port, and propane tank for the emergency generator are all located near the control building. The concrete chlorine contact basin is approximately 23-feet wide by 36-feet long and 10-feet deep. Final effluent from the chlorine contact basin is dischar ged into a drainage culvert running parallel to a main access dirt road. It then crosses the road and flows into an open, evaporative holding area. A backup treatment process is also available in the form of an ultra-violet (UV) treatment facility. This sy stem is built in parallel and enables treatment of the waste stream as it bypasses the chlorine contact basin. Ditto and Every Technical Centers/Michael Army Airfield. The Ditto wastewater collection and treatment system also serves the Avery Technical Cen ter area and Michael Army Airfield.  In outlying areas, some buildings are serviced by a septic tank and drain field system (not included in the study).  The maps show a new 8 vitrified clay main lane as well as four new manholes serving the Avery Facility . (Date of the upgrade was not discernable from available data.) The old system was abandoned in place. The collection system incorporates a series of primarily 6- and 8-inch gravity lines flowing into a 10-inch vitrified clay main, which, in turns, flows to the lagoons. The system has approximately 16, 500 feet of wastewater collection mains and 64 manholes. A sewage lift station pumps effluent from Avery and Michael Army Airfield into the Ditto collection system via a 4-inch force main. A final lift stati on at the end of the main collection line pumps influent into the lagoon system. A new headworks and lagoon system was completed in 1992 to serve the Ditto wastewater systems. The new lagoon system is comprised of three cells with a holding capacity of one  million gallons per cell. Lagoons have five floating mechanical aerators (2 in cells 1 and 2, and one in Cell 3). Effluent flows to an open, evaporative holding area. Carr Complex. The Carr Complex, located approximately four miles southeast of Ditto, is an independent system. In the past, Carr was totally serviced by septic tank and drain field systems. In most instances, the septic tanks and drain fields were abandoned with new service lines into the collection system and new lagoon. Buildings that remai n on septic systems are not included in this privatization study. The system includes approximately 2,500 feet of 4- and 10- inch collection lines, 1 lift station, 10 manholes, and a sort length of 4-inch force main to the lagoon. A new, 2.28 million gallo n, single cell lagoon was constructed in 1990. It has no mechanical aeration. An emergency overflow channel drains into an open, evaporative area. Baker Complex. Wastewater from all building in Baker Complex is collected by gravity flow into 6-inch cast ir on mains. The system has 24 manholes. The lift station is fed y two 6-inch influent pipes. The prefabricated concrete manhole is approximately ten feet deep and  has two staged, float-activated pumps; each rated at 1.0 HP and 80 GPM. The lift station is equipped with an overflow sensor and alarm. An 8-inch PVC for the main moves the influent to the lagoon. The 1.5 million gallon, single-cell lagoon is not aerated. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered. To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). You may register via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov. Large businesses are requir ed to submit a subcontracting plan which meets the requirements of FAR 52.219-9.

<SOLNBR>DE-PS26-03NT41718-00
<RESPDATE>033103
<ARCHDATE>04302003
<CONTACT>Richard Rogus, Contracting Officer, All calls should be directed to the attention of Martin Byrnes at (412) 386-4486, rogus@netl.doe.gov;Martin Byrnes, Contract Specialist, 412-386-4486, byrnes@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The DOE/NETL is seeking applications to conduct long-term (minimum of two-to-four months at optimum process conditions) field testing of advanced mercury control technologies to (1) verify technology performance in terms of total (50-80%+ based on coal type, equipment, etc.) and speciated mercury removal relative to changes in load and coal-mercury concentration for all coal types (including blends) but emphasizing high-elemental, low rank coals, (2) determine realistic process/equipment costs for various levels of mercury removed for a variety of equipment configurations focusing on smaller surface collection area (SCA) electrostatic precipitators (SCA<300 ft2/thousand actual cubic feet of flue-gas) for bituminous coals , (3) determine mercury removal levels for  blends of different rank coals including subbituminous/high-sulfur bituminous; (4) quantify balance-of-plant (BOP) impacts such as Electro-Static Precipitator (ESP) performance, baghouse performance and bag life, byproduct contamination, corrosion, parasitic load, etc.; and (5) measure and assess potential multiple pollutant or co-control associated with mercury control technology. In addition, several semi-continuous emission monitors (S-CEMS) would be used to monitor variations in mercury content of flue gas and track technology performance while collecting high quality inlet/outlet mercury speciation data with Ontario Hydro measurements at the beginning, middle and end of each test campaign (plus additional measurements as needed to verify S-CEM results). Tests of by-products may be limited to characterization tests (foaming index, etc.) but collection of enough samples would be obtained for other programs to conduct more detailed or extensive tests, and measurement of mercury in all streams (including water) to seek closure on mercury balances. NETL held two workshops (in June and September 2002) with key stakeholders from the utility industry, government agencies, research organizations, and academia to obtain input on the content and structure of future mercury research and development. A summary of the workshop proceedings can be found at www.netl.doe.gov/coalpower/environment.  The workshop participants identified a number of different configurations and technologies that need further long-term testing. In response, DOE-NETL is issuing a solicitation focused on four major areas that are expected to be important in developing mercury control strategies for the coal-fired electric utility industry and help ensure the continued availability of low-cost electricity from coal while meeting growing air quality demands. Details concerning the solicitation are described below (with allowable scale of testing described in the attached Table 1 document. 1). Topic Area 1 would focus on sorbent injection technology, Topic Area 2 would cover technologies aimed at wet flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) enhancement, Topic Area 3 would seek proposals offering oxidation systems and Topic Area 4 would allow for any technologies ready for long-term field-testing. The solicitation supports the overall goal of the Department of Energy/Office of Fossil Energy's Innovations for Existing Plants (IEP) Program to develop advanced technology and knowledge products that enhance the environmental performance of the existing fleet of coal-fired power plants. The four Areas of Interest for this solicitation are: TOPIC 1: FIELD TESTING OF ACTIVATED CARBON/SORBENTS UPSTREAM/DOWNSTREAM OF EXISTING UTILITY PARTICULATE CONTROL DEVICES FOR BITUMINOUS AND LOW RANK COALS (POWDER RIVER BASIN AND LIGNITE) TOPIC 2: FIELD TESTING OF EFFECTIVE MERCURY CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES UPSTREAM OF AND ACROSS WET FLUE GAS DESULFURIZATION SYSTEMS TOPIC 3: FIELD TESTING OF NON-SORBENT BASED CONCEPTS FOR INCREASING THE OXIDATION OF ELEMENTAL MERCURY FOR REMOVAL IN DOWNSTREAM AIR POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT TOPIC 4: OTHER MERCURY CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES READY FOR LONG-TERM FIELD-TESTING Table 1. Topic Area Matrix (See attachment) Scale of Testing DOE anticipates allocating $1.5 million or less in cost sharing per test site. DOE recognizes that certain mercury control technologies proposed for full-scale testing may require significant outlays for capital equipment in order to be tested. Given that the funding available for this solicitation is limited and is to be used primarily for testing and evaluation of the performance of the proposed technology and not for the purchase of equipment, DOE is allowing for slip-stream testing of technologies under Topic Areas 3 and 4. However, if the offeror wants to test at full scale, then they would be required to cover the additional costs above DOE threshold of $1.5 million per test site (or 75% cost sharing, whichever is less). DOE anticipates that funds will be approximately allocated as 2/3 to full-scale testing and 1/3 to pilot-scale testing. It is anticipated that there will be 9-12 Financial Assistance (Cooperative Agreements) awards with performance periods ranging from 12- 42 months. The total estimated Award Value for all projects awarded under this solicitation is estimated at $19-$25 million with total federal funding anticipated between $15-$20 million with a required recipient cost sharing of 25% of total cost. Eligibility for participation in this Program Solicitation is considered to be full and open.  All interested parties may apply.  The solicitation will contain a complete description of the evaluation factors and the relative importance of each factor.   Applications submitted by or on behalf of 1) another Federal agency; 2) a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by another Federal agency; or 3) a Department of Energy (DOE) Management Operating (M&O) contractor will not be eligible for award under this solicitation.  However, an application that includes performance of a portion of the work by a DOE M&O contractor will be evaluated and may be considered for award subject to the provisions to be set forth in Program Solicitation DE-PS26-03NT41718. Once released, the solicitation will be available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page.  At this Internet site you will also be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit an application.

<DESC>TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, OR FAXED REQUESTS for this RFA (Request for Applications) WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  This RFA is SET ASIDE for transportation-related public agencies, including state or local departments of transportation, and state or local mass transit agencies.  The FHWA will NOT accept applications from private or commercial companies; and the FHWA will NOT accept applications from non-profit or not-for-profit agencies.  There is NO INCUMBENT contractor, and NO INCUMBENT recipient.  In this RFA, which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) currently estimates will be published on approximately March 20, 2002 in FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov, the FHWA will be seeking Applications for a new Cooperative Agreement to be entitled ?TMC Applications of Archived Data Operational Test?.  The Recipient of that Cooperative Agreement will execute an operational test to study how the operational practices and procedures of a Transportation Management Center (TMC) can benefit through the applied use of archived data from highway-based and/or transit-based Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) sources.  The project will include an examination of how specific TMC functions can be enhanced through performance measures and analytical techniques enabled through archived data.  The results of the operational test will be used to support the development of guidance for applying archived data to enhance TMC operations, practices and procedures.  In this operational test the archived data will be applied to effect transportation operations and management decisions.  The operational test will consider how currently employed methods that apply archived data can be refined and reproduced.  This project will focus on integrated archiving that combines ITS collected data from two or more ITS sources (or centers, as they are defined in the National ITS Architecture).  The ITS sources are likely to include archived weather events, speed, travel time, transit vehicle and/or traffic volume records corresponding to special events along with recurring congestion.  In addition, this operational test will supply a historical context on traffic and travel conditions that supply TMC services such as 511 traveler information service.  It is currently estimated that the resulting new cooperative agreement will be cost-reimbursable, with an estimated 18-month period of performance.  The FHWA does reserve the right to award more than one cooperative agreement from this RFA, but the making of more than one award is currently considered unlikely.  TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THIS RFA WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Instead, all prospective Applicants (i.e., offerors) are to obtain the RFA from FedBizOpps, at http://www.eps.gov. Any subsequent AMENDMENTS to the RFA will LIKEWISE be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address cited above, and the FHWA does NOT plan to mail out any HARD COPIES of any such Amendments.  Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each Applicant to closely and frequently MONITOR FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the RFA.  Monitoring FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFA will be absolutely ESSENTIAL for all prospective Applicants, since Amendments usually contain crucial information.  Please note that the due date shown above is merely an ESTIMATE of the date on which Applications will be due.  The ACTUAL due date for the FHWA?s receipt of Applications will be stated in the RFA.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  Navy Public Works Center Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia CA Study.  OMB Circular A-76 Cost Comparison Study to determine the most efficient method of providing maintenance, repair and minor construction services for buildings, structures, and transportation maintenance and operations services at the U.S. Naval Installations, organizations, and activities in Philadelphia, Mechanicsburg, Earle and other locations.  Other services provided at the Naval Weapons Station Earle site are railroad operations, ordnance handling and pier operations.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government.  The Study will determine whether these services should be performed under a contract with commercial sources or through the federal work force.  A government proposal to provide these services is being developed and a contract may or may not result.  The scope of the requirement is to provide supplies, supervision, labor and equipment to perform maintenance, repair and minor construction services for buildings, structures, railroad and pier operations, ordnance handling, as well as maintenance and operations for transportation.  Prospective respondents should take particular note of the prohibition on using non-U.S. citizens as workers in certain physical areas of the work.  This procurement is the result of a Commercial Activities OMB Circular A-76 Revised, August 4, 1983 and Circular No. A-76, Revised Supplemental Handbook, Performance of Commercial Activities, March 1996.  Furthermore, this solicitation is in conformance with the Navy?s Competitive Sourcing Support Office guidebook, ?Succeeding at Competition?, January 1997 and the Office of Chief of naval Operations (OPNAV) Instruction 4860.7C, ?Commercial Activities (CA) Program Manual?, June 7, 1999.  The proposed acquisition will be subject to Government in-house cost comparison to determine the economic feasibility of accomplishing services in-house or by contract in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.  Any resultant contract will be a Combination Firm Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity Type Contract for a base period of up to twelve months with four twelve month option periods to extend, total duration not to exceed sixty (60) months.  .  Best Value Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement. The proposals received in response to the solicitation will be fully evaluated by the Source Selection Team on the stated technical evaluation factors. Proposals may be evaluated on the following factors: 1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management Approach and Organization; 3) Technical Approach, Experience and Qualifications, 4) Phase in Plan Safety, 5) Commitment to Small Business and 6) Price.  The contract will be awarded to the best value contractor, if the contractor?s cost proposal is lower than the Government?s proposal, taking into consideration the minimum cost differential requirements.  The minimum differential is the lesser of 10 percent of the personnel costs in the performance period.  The purpose of the minimum cost differential is to avoid the disruption of converting performance of the commercial activity based on a minimal cost savings.  The North American Industry Classification Code for this requirement will be 561210 with the average annual receipts for the last three years being $20,000,000.00.  This procurement is being issued as UNRESTRICTED and is therefore subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hubzone Small Business Concerns.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>IF A RESPONSE WAS ALREADY SUBMITTED FOR THE ORIGINAL REQUEST, THEN A RESPONSE IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS REQUEST.

General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking expressions of interest from fee title owners, or their duly authorized representatives, willing to give GSA an assignable option to purchase a site, (or an assemblage of properties) or acquire the site subject to a ground lease in perpetuity for a future lease construction project.  This expression of interest is for the SITE only.

GSA intends to acquire an assignable site option and then solicit bids for a build-to-suit lease on behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The property owner must agree to convey title to the successful offeror of the lease/developer procurement via the assignable option, or grant the successful offeror of the lease/developer procurement a ground lease in perpetuity.  The current property owner may compete in the lease procurement.  All interested parties should address the following and forward their expressions of interest to the address listed below by October 11, 2002.

A minimum site area of seven and one-half (7 1/2) acres proximate to public transportation and an academic/research institution is required in the following delineated area:

WEST:  MD Route 650 (New Hampshire Avenue)
SOUTH:  Washington, DC City limits
EAST:  Bladensburg Road to MD Route 450 (Annapolis Road) to MD Route 564
NORTH:  Springfield Road west to Beaver Dam Road to south on Edmonston Road and west on Sunnyside Avenue to south on MD Route 1 (Baltimore Avenue) to west on Interstate 495

REQUIREMENT:  The site must be properly zoned for a commercial office facility of approximately 275,000 renatble square feet.  In support of GSA's Brownfield Initiative, we will consider abandined, idled, or underused commercial sites where redevelopment is complicated by real or pereceived environmental contamination.  The owner shall provide any existing environmental information available for the site.  In addition, teh owner shall advise if there are any known archaeological resources on or near the site.

<DESC>Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for Ship Disposal Solutions

Description: THIS MODIFICATION AMENDS THE BASIC PRDA BY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PERIOD, FROM January 27, 2003 THROUGH January 31, 2003.  All proposals must be RECEIVED by MARAD no later than 2 PM US EST on January 31, 2003 to be considered timely and responsive to this amendment.  Proposals received after that time will be considered late and not accepted or considered for award.

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA; Suisun Bay, CA; and Beaumont, TX.  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A to Modification #4 of this PRDA.  The list of ships (Attachment A) is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  MARAD anticipates that the obsolete vessels in the worst condition, many of which are located in the James River Reserve Fleet, will be disposed of using traditional competitive contracting practices, depending on the availability of funding.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) has been issued to solicit industry comments to that end.

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of the remaining obsolete vessels by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2006.  The use and/or development of Government facilities is not excluded.


Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A
?Y Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution


In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.   

Historically, the annual program level associated with MARAD ship disposal has been $10 million. The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered. 

Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:

1. Technical/engineering/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below,  shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
?Y Production throughput/capacity
?Y Environmental considerations
?Y Worker safety and health considerations
?Y Hazardous abatement considerations
?Y Requisite experience

2. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient enough detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel(s), including cost categories such as towing, remediation of hazardous materials, labor costs etc, as appropriate. Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach. 
Submission of pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.

Individual offeror?s may submit multiple proposals.  Proposals must be separable and each in accordance with the above criteria.

 Instructions for the Submission of Proposals:
Initial responses to this PRDA must be submitted not later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on November15, 2001 to:

	U.S. Department of Transportation
	Maritime Administration
	Office of Acquisition, MAR-380
	400 Seventh Street S.W., Room 7310
	Washington DC 20590
	Attn: Mr. MICHAEL DELANEY

Offerors must submit five (6) complete copies for each proposed approach, inclusive of  technical/engineering/production/management and funding/pricing proposals. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  

It is the intent of the Maritime Administration that this notice be valid until 1 year from the initial date of posting, unless otherwise canceled/amended. 


Submission address remains unchanged for subsequent proposals. 

Questions regarding this PRDA must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the following Internet addresses:

QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES:
1.Is there a prescribed format or guidelines to be followed in the preparation of the technical and cost proposals or a combination thereof?  RESPONSE: No;  but  do address all the areas outlined in the Statement of Work
2.Will the use of licensing sub-agents be permitted in the prospective contract?
RESPONSE: Such offers should be included in the proposal.
3.Are you able to supply a sample contract or ?boiler plate? of the prospective contract?
RESPONSE: The Contract will be performance base, based on the selected proposal. 
4. What is the desired format for licensing fees and costs under the cost proposal?  (for example, recovery of a percentage of licensing revenues, billing for costs plus load factors, or a combination thereof)?
RESPONSE: Do include this information in your proposal as indicated in the Statement of Work.
5.Will the cost of yearly events and cost audits be defrayed by the FS separately or if they to be recovered by the contractor as part of the licensing revenues?
RESPONSE:  Such costs should be considered in your proposal if they are to be recovered by the contractor as part of the licensing revenues.
6.What will be the terms of this contract with regard to time period, payment of residuals (particularly royalties earned after the contract termination date)?
RESPONSE: The time period is anticipated at five years.   No, royalties will be paid after the termination of the contract with the Licensing Contractor.
7.Are you the current licensing contract holder?
RESPONSE: The contract for the licensing contractor will be with the USDFA Forest Service (FS) and each license contract with individual vendors is also with the FS.
8.With 49 current licensing vendors, what are their tasks or how are their programs coordinated between them?
RESPONSE: There is no coordination between the individual licensee contractors by the FS except as it relates to standards for use of the Image.  All are independent business peoples marketing and selling their approved products.
9.What steps or information should be submitted in order to make a strong bid proposal for this opportunity?
RESPONSE:  The statement of work outlines FS expectations for a licensing based on our current and past experience.  FS is interested in new ideas, proposal, and direction.  The purpose of the request is for your company to tell the FS how you would manage the licensing program.
10.What is a royalty?
RESPONSE:  It varies and is negotiated by the licensing contractor usually about 6-8%.  In some cases where the licensee provides a service a flat rate is negotiated.
11.What are the items?
RESPONSE: Visit the Cambridge Consulting website which has a list of current products that are licensed.
12.Items whatever we want licensed?
RESPONSE: No, all products must be connected to Fire Prevention and the promotion of Fire Prevention.  It is not wide open.  All licensees and products must be approved by the FS
13.Are there designated stores to buy the merchandise?
RESPONSE:  No, however several vendors have web sites and catalogs.  Store sales are not prohibited.
14.Is there a guarantee?
RESPONSE:  No.   The FS is looking for a company to MANAGE the Smokey Bear Licensing program.
15.What is the current annual budget for this program?
RESPONSE:  FS does not have an annual budget for this program.  The revenues are generated from the licensees, then are placed in a special fund and used only for Fire Prevention.
16.What collaborative efforts have been most successful in the past?
RESPONSE:  Some licensees are charged an annual fee for those products that individual sales are not easily determined.  Collectively they have been good partners.  Licensees skills at marketing vary considerable.  Some are very small contributors but are located in key niche places.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
COMMANDER&#64979;IN&#64979;CHIEF U. S. PACIFIC FLEET
SOLUTION PROVIDER INITIATIVE (SPI)
(PHASE VI ? SOLUTION FACILITATOR INITIATIVE (SFI)


INTRODUCTION:

Commander, U. S. Pacific Fleet (CDRPACFLT) is embarked on an ongoing and ambitious project known as the Solution Provider Initiative (SPI), to continuously enhance efficiency and to restructure processes within its headquarters, type commanders (TYCOMs) staff, Regional Commands (Reg Coms), operational fleet (afloat initiatives) and field activities.  This project, SPI Phase VI ? Solution Facilitator Initiative (SFI) Ashore, will leverage the successes from the FY01 and FY02 SFI efforts, utilize industry best practices and business process reengineering techniques, and use the Navy?s investment in information technology (IT) to fundamentally change the way Pacific Fleet (PACFLT) headquarters (HQ) and Regional Commands conduct business.  The project will single up regional business processes, standardize procedures, and enhance knowledge management, information sharing, and collaboration across the PACFLT enterprise.  The FY03 SFI effort will extend FY02 SFI successes and embark on new initiatives with the intent of implementation across the PACFLT enterprise.  This statement of work describes this next phase.

BACKGROUND:

SPI was developed to leverage technology in creating a knowledge/network centric environment in which information and knowledge could be managed intelligently and efficiently.  In FY97, CINCPACFLT decided that leveraging technology could be achieved best by partnering with industry that had aggressively and successfully reengineered processes in recent years.

As the first step, SPI focused on conducting Business Process Reengineering (BPR) at CINCPACFLT HQ.  Processes were modified and numerous tools were created to improve decision-making and efficiencies.  SPI evolved to include the TYCOMs; COMNAVSUBPAC, COMNAVAIRPAC, and COMNAVSURFPAC, in which tools and processes improvements developed for CINCPACFLT HQ, were imported in conjunction with developing command-specific solutions.

The next challenging step was initiated when SPI teams deployed with the USS JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN-74) battle group and the USS BONHOMME RICHARD (LHD-6) amphibious ready group.  In addition, a SPI team was provided to the Network Centric Innovation Center (NCIC) in San Diego, which was established to provide an institutional framework for developing fleet Best Practices (BP) and documenting SPI actions afloat for use in future deployments.  SPI support for the operational fleet continued with a team deployed on the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN-72) battle group and a strengthening of the SPI team at NCIC.  At the same time, SPI support was provided to the CONUS regions under the name Solution Facilitator Initiative (SFI).

OBJECTIVE:

The specific objectives of the work are:
1.	To develop solutions to common problems that can be implemented across the PACFLT area of responsibility (AOR).
2.	To standardize and streamline processes and systems across PACFLT.
3.	To maximize return on investment.
4.	To improve decision-making capability.
5.	To complete initiatives selected by the SFI Review Board and implement across the PACFLT AOR.
6.	To ensure and coordinate PACFLT Program Managers? concurrence on selected initiatives.
7.	To ensure NMCI compliance where applicable.
8.		To continuously improve the program management, readiness, and administrative processes of the PACFLT enterprise.

SFI TEAMS

Each consultant team deployed to a region shall consist of at least one consultant SFI Team Lead.  There shall also be a consultant Project Manager staffed at CINCPACFLT to support enterprise solutions and provide overall coordination of SFI ashore initiatives and guidance to the Team Leads.  SFI Team Leads shall report to the SFI Project Manager staffed at CINCPACFLT who in turn shall report to the Government (CINCPACFLT N46) SFI Program Manager or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  The Regional Business Managers or designated representatives are expected to be the Government on site contractor managers and shall provide the appropriate guidance and direction to the deployed SFI teams and Team Leads.  The on site contractor manager shall provide feedback to the Government SFI Program Manager on overall project status and progress.

The SFI Program Manager, in concert with the SFI Review Board, reserves the right to modify the contract and the Statement of Work to change SFI team compositions and levels of effort.  It is understood such modifications may result in changes to the price of this contract.  For example, should CINCPACFLT decide to implement an enterprise-wide solution during the period of this contract, the SFI Program Manager reserves the right to reorganize deployed skill sets and levels of effort to accommodate such an implementation plan.

MAJOR TASKS:

A.  Financial Knowledge Management (FKM).  Lead region ? COMNAVFORJAPAN/ COMNAVMAR.

Regional Program Managers and Financial Managers/Comptrollers require documented financial processes and supporting tools to support effective program planning, budgeting, and execution and to obtain timely and accurate financial information/reports.  COMNAVMAR has completed a web-enabled financial portal that contains financial guidance, templates, policies, budgeting information, funds status reporting, data calls, and inter-service support agreement processes that link departmental and financial information in support of collaboration among activities requiring shared financial data.  COMNAVFORJAPAN has extended the concept to use the features of e-KM.  In addition, many regions are collecting activity-based costing information that can be used to support these financial processes.  The SFI team shall:

?	Configure a financial management solution based upon the FKM tools developed in COMNAVMAR and COMNAVFORJAPAN that incorporates access to activity-based costing information.
?	Implement the solution in participating regions.  The participating regions are COMNAVREGNW, COMNAVREGHI, COMNAVFORKOREA, and NAVREGCONTCEN SINGAPORE.  

B.  Performance Management.  Lead region - COMNAVREGSW.

Regional Commanders require a standardized methodology and database or system to be able to gauge the regions? core business lines? (IMAP Core Business Model 2003-https://ucso1.hq.navy.mil/imap/cbm.htm) status.  The SFI team shall:

?	Identify and standardize output performance metrics for all major regional business elements as shown on the IMAP Core Business Model 2003 across PACFLT's regions.
?	Validate performance metrics with all regions and CPF.
?	Evaluate viable systems taking into consideration regional and CPF requirements and associated cost.
?	Develop a recommendation for selecting and implementing a Performance Management measurement tool).
?	Develop cost to create and maintain a Performance Management tool.

<DESC>FOLATE and NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is planning to extend the period of performance of its contract with The Health Research Board (HRB) of Dublin,Ireland for a  clinical research study entitled, "Folate and Neural Tube Defects". The HRB received award N01-HD-2-3163 to participate in an NICHD study to demonstrate how folate supplements reduce the occurrence of neural tube defects in a
 high risk population. The HRB has developed a unique, geographically-based study of women who have had blood samples collected during pregnancies that produced infants with neural tube defects. The proposed extension will expand on previously conducted biochemical and genetic investigations and continue recruitment. Extensive biochemical analysis has been performed on study subjects. Continuity requires that the same laboratory perform biochemical testing for the future work. This is particularly important in the case of folate assays which have been shown by a CDC study to produce results that vary substantially from laboratory to laboratory. Any organization that has: 1. a  geographically-based sample of women who are not using vitamin supplements on whom blood has been collected during pregnancies resulting in neural tube defect offspring, 2. blood samples from subjects with neural tube defects and first degree relatives, 3. genetic data from a genetically homogeneous population relevant to neural tube defects for families with neural tube defect members, and 4. the capability of conducting other genetic investigations and is interested in performing these tasks, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirements to continue this project. The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work as described. This is not a request for proposals. Capability statements, not to exceed 20 pages, should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to: Mr. Charles W. Grewe, Contracting Officer, CMB, OAM, NICHD, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Room 7A07,MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 or via e-mail at cg59b@nih.gov.(See Numbered Note 22).

Factor 3, Guidelines
General case management guidelines may be available but the Nurse Case Manager will be responsible for gathering standards of care guidelines and generating modifications or new guidelines through knowledge gained via interdisciplinary meetings, training, and on the job experiences. The incumbent uses initiative to learn new regulations and to interpret developments in the field, and to recommend changes to improve case management services, correct deficiencies, and improve overall support for employees. Judgment is required to assess situations relevant to overall case management.

Factor 4, Complexity

The incumbent independently performs difficult and complex reviews and analysis of psychiatric illnesses and the effects they may have on security clearances. The work consists of using multiple sources of information to analyze and interpret that information in terms of the case review. This needs to be done in a systematic fashion in compliance with complex Federal regulations that are continuing to evolve through ongoing case review and appeals. The incumbent therefore must combine personnel, medical, legal and psycho-social expertise to provide effective case management.
Factor 5, Scope and Effect
The aim of the work is to provide a systematic approach to assembling medical information and the evaluation of medical and security clearance issues, resulting in DOS compliance with federal employment legislation and timely medical processing of employee case reviews. 
Factor 6, Personal Contacts
Personal contacts are with health care professionals who are experts in their field, attorneys, upper level managers and subjects. The Nurse Case Manager will also be expected to represent the Department of State at national meetings in the areas of case management.
Factor 7, Purpose of Contacts
Contacts are to influence the quality and timeliness of the Nurse Case Management Program within existing legislation and regulation.
Factor 8, Physical Demands
Work is performed primarily while sitting, however, some walking; bending, stooping, reaching or stretching is required. There is a physical requirement to do repetitive tasks that involve manual dexterity by operating work processing equipment (telephones, file cabinets, computers etc.) for extended periods of time.

Factor 9, Work Environment

The work is generally performed in an office setting. The work place is adequately lighted, heated, and ventilated.

<DESC>NA The US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, and the cost-sharing partner, Miami-Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management (DERM), are planning the development of a management-accessible, decision support tool to document curre nt conditions and predict changes in Biscayne Bay (Miami, Florida) water quality due to anticipated modifications to loadings and physical changes to delivery and receiving systems.  Located on the southeast coast of Florida, extending from Miami-Dade Coun ty south to Monroe County, Biscayne Bay is a shallow, clear water subtropical estuary-lagoon system that supports a wide variety of fish, wildlife, and benthic communities  (See figure).  The local environmental managers are requesting a tool that can, in general, track and predict the distribution and concentration of substances in the water (particulate and dissolved, and under chronic & acute exposure conditions, including nutrients, suspended sediments, sewage indicators, and selected metals and organic s).  The following list includes examples of basic objectives that local managers intend the tool to accomplish:  (1)  project concentrations or loads of nutrients and other contaminants that must be maintained at the boundaries to prevent degradation of w ater quality in receiving portions of Biscayne Bay,  (2)  track and predict concentration of contaminants (e.g.. sewage pollution indicators) introduced during acute exposure events; (3) predict and integrate light attenuation and related water quality par ameters with depth and salinity to project water quality conditions likely to affect distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation  (Submerged Aquatic Vegetation, or SAV) distribution; and (4)  be able to assess fate and transport of substances (e.g. toxins  such as metals and organics) in sediment.  The tool must be able to validate important cause-effect relationships and also be able to distinguish clearly between man-made and naturally induced variations. A two-dimensional, finite element hydrodynamic cir culation and salinity model (TABS-MDS) has been developed and validated for the Bay and is available but not required for use as the hydrodynamic forcing model.  Any alternative hydrodynamic model or any other means of providing hydrodynamic forcing condit ions for the water quality tool proposed by the responder will be welcomed and considered.  For further elaboration on the objectives, definition of terms, and a listing of parameters of interest, please see the following site:  https://ebs1.saj.usace.army .mil/ebs/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp.  This RFI is identified as DACW17-03-Z-0001.  After selecting this project, go to Download/View Solicitation Files.  There will be a file available for download containing the information shown above.  The purpose of  this RFI is to seek interested party input and information regarding the availability of existing tools or alternatives including the feasibility or plausibility of developing new tool(s) to meet the needs of the environmental managers.  Request such part ies submit a response of interest, including a statement of whether entity possesses or has experience developing relevant tools that meet the specifications, a brief synopsis of the anticipated approach that would be undertaken, and the type of tool (incl uding FDM, FEM, or other analytical approach or model) that would be recommended.  Information that may be submitted includes, but is not limited to, history of entity's experience with similar analysis tools, description of existing mathematical system or  computer simulation model that would likely fulfill one or more of the basic objectives listed above, an indication of which of these functions are addressed, and examples of proven successful applications, along with a POC/customer name and phone number.   For computer simulation models, supplementary information should be included such as code type, grid characteristics, typical time step, required hardware pla tform, and run time on typical hardware platform.  The Government may want to investigate and confirm applicability and acceptability of the tool to address the intended purposes.  An estimate or range of projected time and cost required in the development  and application of the tool, and if possible, any anticipated cost involved in a more rigorous assessment of the tools capability, are also desirable.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL DATA.  Please mail, fax or email your written r esponses to this RFI no later than January 6, 2003.  Mailing address:  P.O.

1.0 PURPOSE
The USDA Forest Service (USFS) is seeking a Contractor to independently review the agency?s Law Enforcement and Investigations (LEI) Program.  With the initiation of this review, the USFS seeks to gain information and recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the USFS LEI program. 
2.0 BACKGROUND: In the fiscal year 1994 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, the Forest Service was directed to establish a separate, independent chain of command for the criminal investigations staff to ensure investigative independence and compliance with the President?s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) standards. Prior to that time, LEI programs were integrated in Forest Service organizations at all levels and field officers and agents were supervised by local line officers (i.e. Regional Foresters, Forest Supervisors, and District Rangers).  Many of these supervisors did not have any law enforcement background and/or experience.  The establishment of a separate independent chain of command was a significant change for the Forest Service organization and culture.

The LEI program is charged with providing a safe environment for the public and employees on National Forest System (NFS) lands and protecting natural resources and other property under the agency?s jurisdiction. The LEI staff cooperates with Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and other Forest Service programs to carry out its mission.

Approximately 490 uniformed law enforcement officers patrol NFS lands that cover approximately 192 million acres.  These officers have the following responsibilities:

?	Conduct patrols on NFS lands to prevent and detect crime, make arrests, and execute search warrants;   

?	Provide timely and effective response to the public with regard to accidents, search and rescue, medical assistance, homeland security, hazardous materials spills and other first responder incidents;

?	Respond to and conduct preliminary investigations on criminal activity including domestic disputes in campgrounds, assaults, gang activity, resource damage, theft and depredation of government property, and violation of Alaska Subsistence laws and regulations.

?	Facilitate cooperative crime prevention efforts at the local community level with other Forest Service programs, communities, and other partners;  

?	Respond to spontaneous public events and other unauthorized gatherings including environmental protests and rave parties;

?	Issue violation or warning notices for the commission of misdemeanors offenses; 

?	Eradicate domestic Cannabis plants and locate and investigate the possession, sale and transportation of illegal drugs; 

?	Conduct preliminary investigations to adequately obtain information for appropriate adjudication, further investigation, and/or claims for or against the government;

?	Engage in cooperative law enforcement agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies for extraordinary expenses incurred while enforcing state law on NFS lands.  

?	Provide support to the Agency in preventing and responding to employee and facility safety and security and workplace violence.

LEI has six primary investigative priorities: (1) assaults and threats to Agency employees and facilities, (2) timber and other forest product theft, (3) wildland fire, (4) archeological resource theft and damage, (5) illegal drug production, distribution, and cross-border smuggling, and (6) eco-terrorism.  

There are approximately 125 criminal investigators that carry out the following responsibilities:  

?	Conduct criminal investigations on matters related to NFS lands, and agency interests, in compliance with applicable guidelines set forth in the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE), "Quality Standards for Investigations;"   

?	Conduct internal investigations concerning alleged criminal misconduct by Agency employees and government programs in accordance with a Memorandum of Agreement with the USDA Office of Inspector General; and

?	Develop, improve, and demonstrate new technologies, materials, methods, and strategies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of agency enforcement and investigative activities.
