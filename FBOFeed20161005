<p>The current DoD Human Exploration Payloads contract period will expire on 31 October 2016.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During planning, preparation, and execution of the follow-on acquisition, the Government musts sustain the current level of contract support to critical space missions and requires a minimum 12-month carry-over contract to bridge the gap for a follow-on contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Four three-month contract options are also planned to cover unexpected delays to the follow-on contract award.</p>
<p>A competitive acquisition for the follow-on acquisition is planned to be accomplished during the initial 12-months of this bridge effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>For this bridge, given the unique and highly skilled nature of the effort, the incumbent is the only contractor who can provide these services without an unacceptable delay to mission schedules. This sole source contract will allow the incumbent, MEI Technologies Inc., to provide the full-spectrum of services required to support the flight of Department of Defense and reimbursable payloads on the International Space Station, its resupply launch vehicles, and related research platforms including: STP-H5, STP-H6, Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA), and STPSat-4 until the follow-on contract is awarded. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This action will result in a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract, with an estimated contract value of $9.4M.</p>
<p>This <span style="COLOR: black">Pre-Solicitation</span> Notice is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice for this carry-over effort.</p>

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for Pyrotechnic guillotine cable cutters.
<p>NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Pacific Scientific Energetic Materials Company (PSEMC). PSEMC is the manufacturer of these guillotine types and the only distributor due to their proprietary nature. These guillotine cable cutters have been used for testing at NASA LaRC for many years.  These cutters are a part of the design of LaRC's full-scale crash testing release system.  Using another brand would require qualification testing and a modification or partial redesign of the release system. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide the required service and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on 10/12/2016. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

NAVAIR anticipates awarding multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts with the period of performance estimated at five (5) years. Tasks performed under this service contract will require contract operators to have a secret clearance and provide 24/7 ISR services, which require the contractor to conduct all planning, coordination, certification, installation, pre-deployment, deployment, logistics, maintenance, flying, and post-deployment efforts necessary to successfully conduct worldwide ship-based and/or land-based missions. These missions will be executed in combat zones supporting combat operations OCONUS, as well as non-combat operations CONUS. Offerors are expected to provide imagery services using non-developmental contractor-owned and contractor-operated unmanned aircraft systems. It is anticipated that the offeror would be able to support multiple simultaneous task orders within one procurement year with contractor personnel supporting DOD and Other Government Agencies (OGA) requirements. Following contract award, the contractor shall be expected to deploy to land and/or ship based missions within 90 days. This is a follow-on service effort that is currently satisfied by a competitively awarded multiple award contract (MAC), IDIQ.</p>

<p><br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The DoD Teleport System provides tactical users access to the Defense Information Switched Network (DISN) services in a seamless, interoperable, and economical manner anywhere in the world between latitudes 65 degrees North and South. The DoD Teleport System has been fielded in a series of generations with Generation One and Two being completed in 2010. Generation I Fiscal Year ((FY) 02-08) fielded capabilities for C, X, Ku, EHF, and UHF bands. Generation II (FY06-10) fielded Ka-bands and Intranet Protocol (IP) capability. Generations I and II require constant technical refresh/technical insertion to keep up with evolving technology. Teleport Generation 3, currently being fielded, provides for three satellite gateway enhancements funded by Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Objective Memorandum (POM) 2010 Issue Paper 3414-01. The issue paper advocated for support of critical satellite gateway enhancements which would enable the synchronized fielding of satellite terminals with their respective space segments. The critical gateway enhancements identified in the issue paper were:</p>
<p>&bull; Advanced Extremely High Frequency Extended Data Rate (AEHF XDR) terminals; <br />&bull; Wideband Global System enhanced X- and Ka-multiband (WGS X/Ka) terminals; <br />&bull; Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) <br />Systems Interoperability</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>

<DESC>The United States Government intends to evaluate the renewal of a lease, with the Lessor of 1600 Stewart Ave, Westbury, NY 11590 21,580 rentable square feet (RSF), yielding 17,184 ANSI-BOMA office area square feet (ABOASF), to extend the term for an additional five years effective May 1, 2017 through April 30, 2022. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to complete the lease requirement and pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency overtime.

All firms responding to this SSN are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only.  This is strictly market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.    <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code contemplated for this acquisition is 541330, Engineering Services.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541330 $38.5M. <br>  <br> The Close Combat Tactical Trainers (CCTT) Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) requirement was previously awarded as a competitive action under the provisions of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637) and in accordance with (IAW) FAR 19.8 -- Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program).  As a result of the Class Deviation, issued pursuant to the Dynalantic Corporation v. DOD Settlement Agreement dated January 30, 2014, the Government anticipates this effort will be removed from the 8(a) Business Development program.   <br>  <br> It is the Government's intention to solicit this requirement as a Small Business Set-Aside IAW FAR 19.5 - Set-Asides for Small Businesses; however the current capabilities of industry, to include large and small business, must be confirmed.  As such, all eligible large and small businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from respondents as a result of this SSN.   <br>  <br> The intent of this notice is to determine the availability of qualified sources technically capable of providing the requirements described in Attachment 1 - DRAFT PWS PEO-STRI-15-W098 PDSS 2017 and the Additional Program Requirements below: <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI has a requirement to provide PDSS for the fielded CCTT systems.  This effort will consist of PDSS primarily for the CCTT and Dismounted Soldier Training Systems (DSTS). <br>  <br> CCTT is a collective training device composed of three systems (CCTT, RVTT and DSTS).  CCTT collectively trains Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mechanized Infantry, and Armored Reconnaissance units from Squad through Battalion/Squadron level, to include their staffs in order to increase and sustain readiness.  The primary training audience operates from immersive full-crew simulators, mock-up command posts, and live battalion command posts to train in combined arms maneuver and wide area security tactical missions, conduct mission rehearsal, and enhance live training.  <br>  <br> PDSS for CCTT is responsible for providing all aspects of software support to CCTT and its projects/subsystems in order to maintain its main mission of providing a virtual collective training capability, as well as the obsolescence of CCTT and DSTS hardware. <br>  <br> The system contains a mix of current and legacy custom built, COTS and GOTS applications from multiple vendors including other Government agencies. It will require complex configuration management, including development and test of multiple software baselines in tandem. It will require software and hardware installation and support for more than 500 simulators at over 40 sites both CONUS and OCONUS. It will require the maintenance and operation of a development lab with no less than eight highly complex manned modules to support the overarching PDSS requirements.  <br>  <br> This effort will consist of PDSS Basic services including Program Management Office (PMO) oversight as well as engineering, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, logistics, and maintaining the various lab assets.  This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, supporting Interoperability between training systems, maintaining Cybersecurity and Authority to Operate (ATO) and fielding approved changes to CCTT hardware and software baseline accomplished through PDSS. <br>  <br> This effort includes the integration and support of Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) development and LVC-IA products as directed by the Government. This effort includes the integration and development of OneSAF products and the integration of SE Core databases and moving models.  <br>  <br> This effort includes various other efforts such as Subject Matter Expert (SME) consultation, Training Services, help desk support, and required contractor logistics support. <br>  <br> Contractors shall note that due to the nature of the data and software that is going to be dealt with for this effort, there will be distribution agreements addressing security/export compliance requirements that must be met, as such there will be an exclusion of Foreign Companies/Foreign Nationals.  All personnel must have a secret clearance to work on the CCTT PDSS contract and development will be required in a controlled environment. <br>  <br> Contractor will develop and support software using non-proprietary components.  All software is to be developed and modified to provide Government Purpose Rights.  Any contractor presenting a proposal using proprietary components/software will not be considered for this effort.  The software build environment must be self-contained, not dependent on any capital assets. <br>  <br> The information above does not preclude the use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software in your particular solution.  However, the intent behind requiring GPR is to allow the Government to pursue future upgrades/modifications and Life Cycle Support in a competitive environment.  Excessive use of COTS that contain restrictive rights or recurring licensing agreements does not support this intent and may be considered a weakness in contractor approaches should this effort progress to Request for Proposals. <br>  <br> Transition from the current PDSS contractor to the new contractor must not cause disruption to other ongoing efforts supported by PDSS. <br>  <br> The CCTT PDSS must be located in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area and effort must be performed in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area. This is required in order to have access to and connectivity with other PM ITE programs; and facilitate integration support with SE Core and LVC-IA. <br>  <br> The facility must be able to support classified and unclassified work. <br>  <br> The facility must provide high bay space, power, network access, etc. for the PDSS assets to include at least each configuration of manned modules that are fielded. <br>  <br> QUANTITIES: Core PDSS tasks and technical services include: <br>  <br> Program Management Office (PMO) <br> Hardware and Software Baseline Management <br> Fielding of new hardware and software baselines <br> Configuration Management of all software and the complete library of all design documentation, drawings, TDP, manuals, etc. <br> Cybersecurity design, implementation, patching, accreditation <br> Discrepancy Report management <br> User Support - help desk for site Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) crew both CONUS and OCONUS <br> Training Assistance Services for site CLS crews or local unit as requested by the Government <br> Support to LVC-IA integration and test <br> Support to SE Core integration and test <br> Support to OneSAF integration and test <br> Support to interoperability integration and test, with systems such as Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and Games for Training (GFT) <br> Obsolescence and technology insertion efforts <br> Operation and maintenance of PDSS assets <br>  <br> ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:   <br>  <br> The current CCTT PDSS Lab is approximately 21,850 square feet of which 9,966 square feet is allocated for lab space and 11,884 square feet is allocated for office space.  The contractor shall provide a CCTT PDSS Lab facility that is equal to or larger than the current square footage. <br>  <br> At the Government's request, the contractor shall procure field equipment to support CCTT tech refresh or concurrency upgrades under this effort.  <br>  <br> The Government anticipates future requirements may include the PDSS for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) database production capabilities and other PM ITE programs that require PDSS activities. <br>  <br> INDUSTRY DAY: <br>  <br> The Government anticipates holding an Industry Day event, details will be provided at a later date under this Opportunity Number, W900KK-15-R-0042. <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the CCTT PDSS effort. The Government anticipates that the requirements will be fulfilled via task orders under a single source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-Off basis.   <br>  <br> Task orders will be issued from the single award IDIQ contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost and/or Time and Materials (T&M) Contract Line Item Numbers for technical services.  The Period of Performance will be for a one-year base period with four one-year options.

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</strong></span></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST)<br />Starshade Acquisition Camera (SAC)</strong></span></p>
<p><br />NASA would like to survey the market for new or existing designs for a starshade acquisition camera (SAC) in order to incorporate this information into the WFIRST Spacecraft conceptual design and to obtain answers to several questions, listed below.</p>
<p>The WFIRST Project, which is managed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, is investigating vendors who can provide a camera to image a starshade spacecraft and a target star and provide their locations on the detector.  WFIRST is planning on subtracting the provided locations to provide a relative location of the starshade spacecraft to the target star.</p>
<p>Briefly, WFIRST is a NASA observatory designed to perform Wide Field imaging and surveys of the near infrared sky.  WFIRST is a 6.5 year mission (with a 10 year goal), currently targeted to launch in 2025 and will be in orbit at the Sun-Earth L2 point.</p>
<p>In addition, WFIRST was directed to be ready for a future/undefined starshade spacecraft mission that would nominally launch 3 years after WFIRST launches. The high level concept is that a starshade spacecraft will be positioned between a target star and WFIRST.  In order to achieve the positioning, WFIRST will need to provide information of the starshade location relative to the line of sight vector between WFIRST and the target star.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to survey vendor capabilities in designing and building a camera to meet the WFIRST mission requirements. This request is for information and planning purposes and feasibility of the requirements.</p>
<p>While our intent may be to team with an industry partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. This is not a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>To consolidate our planning, responses from industry are requested by December 5, 2016, in the form of written and illustrated concepts, estimates for development costs and schedule, assumptions used for cost and schedule estimates design assumptions, and descriptions of capabilities. Responses can be submitted via email. The email text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, and email address. The information is requested for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information for Planning Purposes."</p>
<p>It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>Technical or procurement questions should be directed to the contacts below.</p>
<p>Interested offeror's shall address the requirements of this RFI in written format as described in the previous paragraphs by electronic mail to the contacts below no later than December 5, 2016.</p>
<p>In addition, please let the contacts below no if you are interested in responding to this RFI prior to the deadline.  Notification of interest will allow us to provide updated/revised information to the requirements below.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Human Exploration and<br />Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) invites NASA Centers (including the Jet<br />Propulsion Laboratory, JPL), industry, academia, and international partners to submit a<br />response to this Request for Information (RFI) to assist NASA in planning for potential comanifested&nbsp;payloads (CPL) for Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2) with a planned launch on a&nbsp;circumlunar mission in 2021.<br /><br />The information obtained will be used by NASA to assess the availability of CPL for EM-2. &nbsp;Payload development must support delivery of the completed payload to the Kennedy&nbsp;Space Center (KSC) to begin launch vehicle integration no later than February 2021 in order&nbsp;to support an earliest possible launch date of August 2021. Focus will be on concepts that&nbsp;align with the agency's human exploration objectives, strategic knowledge gaps (SKG), or&nbsp;National Academies Decadal surveys.<br /><br />As NASA has previously solicited and selected proposals from U.S. industry through the&nbsp;NextSTEP Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Phase 2, this RFI excludes topics related to&nbsp;deep space habitation, habitation system capabilities, and logistics modules. Similarly,&nbsp;response to this RFI for NASA's Resource Prospector (RP) mission is not requested since&nbsp;consideration for RP as a CPL is currently in the trade space. Though this RFI is not&nbsp;requesting response for either habitation related or RP, both of these will be considered for&nbsp;CPL along with the concepts identified through this RFI.<br /><br />NASA will use the information obtained as a result of this RFI on a non-attribution basis. &nbsp;Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by NASA for that purpose&nbsp;would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. &nbsp;The&nbsp;information received will not be released in its submitted form, but may be used in&nbsp;developing the best approach for fulfilling these needs, and therefore may be recognizable&nbsp;to the interested party.<br /><br />Upon receiving and reviewing responses to this RFI, NASA may choose to post a<br />subsequent revision to this RFI to request further information to support NASA's acquisition&nbsp;planning for the contemplated procurement.<br /><br />This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the<br />Government pay for information solicited. The Government does not presently intend to<br />award a contract at this time. A determination by the Government to procure this<br />requirement based upon responses to this notice or other market research is solely within&nbsp;the discretion of the Government. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, Exchanges with Industry&nbsp;Before Receipt of Proposals, paragraph (e), and responses to this notice are not considered&nbsp;offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. &nbsp;This RFI is&nbsp;subject to FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information of Solicitation for Planning Purposes. &nbsp;Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of responses to this RFI. &nbsp;Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. &nbsp;Any responses to this&nbsp;RFI that are subject to export controlled items should be properly marked as such.<br /><br />NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this&nbsp;acquisition can be found at https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.<br /><br />An Interested Parties list will be compiled and posted to allow potential Offerors the<br />opportunity to network. Companies that are interested in being included on the list should&nbsp;send the following information to the Contracting Officer:<br /><br />Company Name:<br />Address:<br />Contact Name:<br />Phone:<br />E-mail:<br /><br />Responses to this RFI must be delivered in .pdf format to<br /> hq-em2-comanifest@mail.nasa.gov,&nbsp;no later than 4:00 p.m. EDT on<br /> November 7, 2016. Responses should not exceed 10 pages in length and must be typed in size 12, Times New Roman font.<br /><br />NASA will hold an informational teleconference for this RFI on October 14, 2016 at 1:00 p.m. &nbsp;EDT. Prospective respondents should call (844) 467-4685, passcode 115646 to be connected&nbsp;to this informational teleconference. Questions can be emailed to the following address hqem2-comanifest@mail.nasa.gov. All questions submitted will be discussed openly during this&nbsp;teleconference and posted with response under this RFI.<br /><br />The information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategy<br />development. NASA will use the information obtained as a result of this RFI on a non-attribution&nbsp;basis. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by NASA for that purpose&nbsp;would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. NASA&nbsp;does not plan to respond to the individual responses. This RFI is being used to obtain&nbsp;information for planning purposes only and the Government does not intend to award a contract&nbsp;at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers&nbsp;and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to&nbsp;FAR 52.215-3.

This effort is independent of TH-XX and is intended to support CNATRAâ€™s current TH-57B/C training requirements until TH-XX Ground Based Training System (GBTS) full operational capability.

There is increasing fleet demand for rotary wing aviators.
  In order to supply this demand, CNATRA needs to both increase its TH-57B/C GBTS event capacity and simulation fidelity.  The purpose of this RFI is to both provide industry information regarding the Governmentâ€™s efforts and also to gather industry feedback so that the Government can decide upon a course of action.

See attached document for more information.

<DESC>NAVFAC Far East is seeking eligible business firms capable of providing construction services associated with the project â€œREPAIRS TO CANTONMENT ELEVATED WATER TANK FACILITY # 1504â€.

The scope of work includes, but is not limited to labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary for all design, engineering and construction services to renovate water tank facility in Diego Garcia.  Project works include: replacement of braces, radial rods, erection rods; repair of fixed, column, and internal ladder; replacement of float level assembly, vents, roof hatch and manhole; refurbishment of electrical systems, including lighting control panel, wirings and conduits, obstruction lights and beacon light; refurbishment of cathodic protection system, including anodes, suspension cables and rectifiers; cleaning of interior and exterior tank surfaces; overall corrosion removal and tank structure repairs; and repainting.
 Failure of this tank will limit the islandâ€™s firefighting capability and also cause the island to lose redundancy in the water system by providing additional pressure to the system in the event of a main pump house malfunction. Delay of award of this project until FY18 will lead to continued degradation of the tank structure and pose unacceptable risk to Diego Garciaâ€™s emergency water supply. The Government is intending a Design-Build construction project, in accordance with the definition at FAR 36.102.

In accordance with advertisement requirements at FAR 36.204 for advanced notices, the magnitude of this construction project would be between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.

BUSINESS LICENSE REQUIREMENT:

International agreements between the United States of America (US) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) concerning US operations on the island of Diego Garcia require that any contract awarded for these requirements must be awarded to an offeror that is a Joint Venture exclusively consisting of US and UK firms, unless no qualified US/UK joint venture submits a reasonable offer.
  For any such Joint Ventures, participation by the US member(s) must be no less than 60% of the venture, participation of the UK member(s) must be no less than 20%, and management control of the entire venture must be vested in the US member(s). US firms that are not part of an eligible joint venture will be permitted to submit a proposal, but will only be eligible to be considered for award if no reasonable offer is received from any qualified joint venture. 

GENERAL INFORMATION:  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 

Firms interested in this effort must be able to demonstrate experience on RELEVANT PROJECTS as a Design Build Contractor.
 For the purpose of this Sources Sought, RELEVANT PROJECTS are defined as projects for construction or repair on the island of Diego Garcia, with construction cost of at least $1M and completed within the last five (5) years or at least 80% complete at the time of proposal submittal. Note: to qualify as a RELEVANT PROJECT, the project must meet all three elements of size, type, and complexity. Interested firms are requested to submit a minimum of one (1), or up to a maximum of three (3), RELEVANT PROJECTS in association with their responses.

Interested firms should submit information as to the capabilities on Attachment A, Contractor Information Form, by Thursday, 13 October 2016 at 0800 Diego Garcia Standard Time (KST).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for Solicitation<br />N64498-16-R-5068
<p><br />THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE is being issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia Division (NSWCPD). NSWCPD has a requirement for a new shaft vibration telemetry system for the Elecrtric Drive Test Facility (EDTF). This system will consist of one ring of 24 total sensor inputs. The telemetry system is comprised of three parts: (1) an inductively powered rotating collar possessing integral electronics required for power conditioning of sensors, on-board low and high frequency filters, appropriate data acquisition sampling rates for the frequency band of interest, etc., (2) a stationary antenna, and (3) a receiver that provides real-time output. Accumetrics, Inc. of Latham, NY is the exclusive provider of non-contacting shaft vibration telemetry systems for the modern Navy noise measurements involving ICP type accelerometers IAW FAR 6.302-1, as only Accumetrics, Inc. meets the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Accumetrics can supply a telemetry system that provides necessary low frequency rejection of the once-per-revolution DC signal due to the earth's gravitational field, and also possesses the required sampling rate for a broad range of frequency coverage over up to 24 accelerometers. Accumetrics is the only supplier that can provide the sensitivity, accuracy and frequency range required for this test facility. In addition, it is required to have a system that is fully compatible with an existing system that will be used by the shipbuilder on the same drive train for the Equipment Under Test (EUT), as it may be necessary to phase-match the sensors on the two rings. As Accumetrics is supplying the telemetry system for the EUT, this can only be performed with another Accumetrics telemetry ring. Therefore, the unique specialized features of the equipment which match requirements of the test measurements require selection of the Accumetrics product.</p>
<p>NSWCPD intends to issue a solicitation to the specified vendor to meet mission requirements. Prior to issuing an Accumetrics, Inc. solicitation, NSWCPD is requesting information in order to make an informed determination regarding procurement strategy. A copy of the DRAFT Purchase Specification is attached.</p>
<p><br />SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES: Responses shall include specific details regarding the ability to provide telemetry system to meet the needs of the Government. Responses shall discuss how your product will meet the requirements found in the SOW.</p>
<p>Responses are not to exceed 3 - 10 pages. Responses shall be in electronic format. A cover page for the response shall be included. The cover page shall include the company name, address, CAGE Code, Business Size Status for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of this RFI and points of contact (names, email, and telephone numbers) at a minimum. The cover page is not considered in the total page count.</p>
<p>NSWCPD will accept only electronic unclassified submission of responses. Responses shall be sent to Christopher Stack at christopher.stack@navy.mil with the subject line "RFI Telemetry System Procurement." All responses shall be unclassified and submitted by no later than 4:30 pm Eastern on October 19, 2016.</p>
<p>This RFI is for market research purposes only and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or as a commitment of any kind by the Government. The Government is NOT seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. This RFI Notice is issued solely for conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and gathering information for planning purposes.</p>
<p>Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI, and the Government will not compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the response to this RFI. The Government will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought:
<p>FY17 Mac Lock Embedded Gate Anchorage Replacement</p>
<p>The scope of the project includes, but is not limited to, the installation of new embedded gate anchorages behind the existing gate anchors and the connection to the lock gate leaf at the MacArthur Lock which is part of the Soo Locks Complex in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The Mac Lock is 80 feet wide by 800 feet long navigation lock which allows vessels to safely transit the 21 foot in drop in water elevation between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes. The scope includes installation of new primary and secondary embedded anchorages at Gates 2 and 5. The embedded gate anchorages distribute the top reaction of the leaf into the concrete lock wall. Each gate leaf is supported by two embedded anchorages, a primary and secondary embedded anchorage. The embedded anchorages are positioned adjacent to the top of the gate leaf, below the surface of the concrete lock wall.</p>
<p>Installation will require removal of concrete to install steel anchorage frames, drilling of concrete cores to accommodate concrete anchor rods, installation of steel anchorage frames and tensioned concrete anchor rods, and placement of new concrete. The contract will also include fabrication of steel embedded anchorage frames and anchor rods. Fabricated elements will consist of fracture critical members and applicable steel specifications. The top of the existing embedded anchorage will be removed to accommodate the connection of the new embedded anchorage to the existing gate leaf, the bottom portion of the existing embedded anchorage shall be abandoned in place. Contract award is expected in summer 2017. Steel fabrication shall begin in summer 2017. Concrete removal shall begin in summer/fall 2017, and placement of components of the new embedded anchorages will likely be allowed during the navigation season (15 April - 20 December). The final installation of the embedded anchorages and connection to the existing gate leaf shall be completed during the Soo Locks winter shutdown period of 21 December - 14 April. Weather conditions during the winter shut down at the Soo Locks are very harsh with low temperatures, heavy snow, and high winds.</p>
<p>The contract will have a 365 calendar day completion requirement. The contract is expected to be awarded in June 2017.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 million.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, which has a size standard of $36.5 Million in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>This is NOT an Invitation for Bid. This announcement is for planning purposes only. Qualified companies are encouraged to respond.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile Regional Directorate of Contracting is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential contractors to perform Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts for design-build and repair/construction of Department of Defense (DoD) healthcare and medical research laboratory facilities in support of the Medical Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) program. The Mobile Regional Directorate of Contracting proposes to utilize a diverse mix of contractors via Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs). A determination regarding the potential for small business set-asides/reserves will be based on the information and interest received as a result of this notice. Potential contracts are planned for a nation-wide scope (continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and US possessions). MEDCOM's area of responsibility includes the following Regional Health Commands (RHCs):
<p>&bull; RHC Atlantic - Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine <br />&bull; RHC Central - Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada <br />&bull; RHC Pacific - Washington, Oregon, California, Hawaii and Alaska</p>
<p>The primary support requirement of the MEDCOM program includes facilities such as health, dental and veterinary clinics, medical research laboratories, medical warehouses, administrative facilities supporting the medical mission, and similar support facilities. The work of scope will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge of the functional operation of Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and research laboratory facilities including equipment, facility support systems, and building structures.</p>
<p>These contracts are intended to provide quick response to MEDCOM's need for design-build, repair and minor construction related, but not limited, to the architectural, mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, security and safety areas of Army healthcare and other DoD medical and research laboratory facilities in a cost effective manner. Since the facilities will typically be in full operation, the contractor will be required to minimize interference with the daily operation of the facilities. In addition, the contractor will be required to implement infection control processes, and comply with Joint Commission requirements for construction work in occupied medical facilities and with requirements of a number of regulatory and accrediting bodies such as the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Work may range from reconfiguration of a single room or repair of a single utility system component to renovation of a hospital wing, which may include both repair of failed and failing systems and components, and minor construction of new systems and components, to exterior and site work. Key personnel, to include on-site supervisors, are required to hold an American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) construction certificate. Total capacity over the potential five year life of the contract (base year plus four one-year options) is $900,000,000.00.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information 
Security Labeling Service
TAC Number:  TAC-17-38415

This is a request for information (RFI) only.  Do not submit a TEP.  It is requested that all contractors interested in participating in this effort please note their interest and provide indication of their respective capabilities to perform the effort described in attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).   

This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bid, Request for Task Execution Plan, Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposal.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the VA in developing its acquisition strategy and PWS.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.

Be advised that set-aside decisions may be made based on the information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses should be as complete and informative as possible.

Background
Veterans Health Administration has a need for an HL7 conformant security labeling as a service to support its health care mission. The SLS would include the capability to automatically label health care information so as to distinguish those Veterans who have 38 USC 7332 protected conditions from those that do not. This service would facilitate information sharing by eliminating the need to require authorizations for the majority population who do not actually have 38 USC 7332 protected conditions prior to a disclosure.
  
The scope of work is principally described as an HL7 conformant security labeling service that accepts VA provided healthcare information as input, leverages contractor managed rule-based heuristics to apply all applicable VA identified Laws, Regulations and Policies including HL7 conformant labels to each information element and section up to and including overall high-water mark, and which then returns the final labeled information as output.  

In addition, the scope of work includes ongoing self-evaluation and quality reporting, manual review for indeterminate cases, and a continuing process of adaptation as information codes and classification rules evolve.

The scope of work is more fully described in the accompanying PWS.

Be advised that set-aside decisions may be made based on the information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses should be as complete and informative as possible.
It is requested that the T4NG prime contractors respond to the following questions:

a.	Provide a summary of your technical capability to meet the requirements.  
The page limit for responses is 15 pages.

Small businesses should also include information as to:

1)	the intent and ability to meet set-aside requirements for performance of this effort, if applicable
2)	information as to available personnel and financial resources
3)	Information as to proposed team members, the percentage of work each is to perform and which PWS requirements are planned to be subcontracted
4)	SDVOSBs must indicate whether at least 50% of the cost of labor is planned to be expended for prime employees or employees of other eligible SDVOSB firms. This should also include the prime planned percentage and if under 50%, the names of the potential team members that may be used to fulfill the 50% SDVOSB requirement. 

Technical Approach

1.	Provide a summary of your technical approach to meet the requirements set forth in the PWS including the solution architecture and integration into VA operations.
2.	Does your solution have varying levels of service (add on features) not covered in the PWS?  If so please elaborate.

Performance

3.	Please provide your expected minimum, maximum and average round trip time to label a document based on the volumes identified in the PWS. Please state any assumptions made (e.g. size and type of documents.)
4.	Do you currently measure these metrics? 
5.	Please provide your expectations for the rate of false positives and false negatives. Please describe your methods for measuring these rates. What are your minimum standards for false negative rates and false positive rates? 

Labeling Service

6.	Describe the service capabilities addressing the ability to redefine sensitivity rules, the ability to process and methods for identify, processing and disposing of documents that cannot be labeled.

7.	Does your solution fully support these document types?




Document Type	Currently Supported	Planned Support	Not Supported
C-CDA V1.1 Continuity of Care Document	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Consultation Notes	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Discharge Summary	?	?	?

8.	Describe how your solution identifies protected conditions in unstructured data fields (e.g., free text) include how it is superior to other approaches.

9.	Please provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the service described in the PWS. If available, please provide details for license fees, usage costs, and maintenance and support costs.

10.	Has the draft PWS provided sufficient detail to describe the technical and functional requirements that encompass the desired solution?
______ YES _______ NO (if No, answer 11)

11.	If "NO", please provide positive or negative feedback regarding the PWS, such as recommended changes, noted exceptions, and ambiguities on elements of the draft PWS  that may contribute to a more accurate proposal submission and efficient, cost effective solution.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), US Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, NE, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to Neogen-Geneseek located in Lincoln, NE that will use the NeoGen GGP HD Chip to assay approximately 75,000 markers in the pig genome for a group of pigs sampled in our NPB project.   We need to use the NeoGen GGP HD Chip to assay approximately 75,000 markers in the pig genome for a group of pigs sampled in our NPB project.  The NeoGen GGP HD Chip is an extension to the original Illumina Porcine SNP60 BeadChip that USMARC helped to develop and commercialize. The SNP markers included in this product were selected to be useful in most commercial swine populations, as well as includes key genetic markers for numerous production traits (many of which were developed at USMARC). As we currently have over 4,000 animals genotyped with these specific SNP, this product will allow us to continue to build on previous research efforts and assimilate a large data set for quantitative genetic analyses.  GeneSeek has created a reputation of producing the highest quality results and completes the effort in a very short time-frame.  The NeoGen GGP HD Chip contains SNP in calpastatin that are needed for association with tenderness.  This is needed to be fully compatible with existing results.<br /> <br />This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotations or proposals. No solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide this service are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a substantive statement with descriptive literature and any other supporting information to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of publication of this notice. All information received within 10 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government to determine if the alternative equipment meets the Government's requirements and is capable of performing the intended task(s). All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to the attention of Donita Furman, fax 402-762-4145, or email at donita.furman@ars.usda.gov. Questions concerning this acquisition must be directed to Donita Furman, email donita.furman@ars.usda.gov.<br />

<CONTACT>Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Email nepal@mcc.gov
<DESC>The Government of the United States, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), is developing a compact with the Government of Nepal (GON) involving Nepal's electrical power sector.
<p>In order to inform the preparation of the compact, MCC and its partner GON agency, the Office of the Millennium Challenge Nepal (OMCN), invite interested parties and organizations from around the world to submit information and brief project concepts regarding potential projects that would improve viability, sustainability and reliability of off-grid electrical power systems in Nepal.</p>
<p>MCC and OMCN will use the information to determine whether and how to design a compact project that could help fund such energy projects in Nepal. Such projects could potentially involve cost-sharing with proponents. Final project selection decisions would be determined at a later date through a separate, open solicitation and/or potentially through a separate, open and competitive grant process.</p>
<p>As determined appropriate, either the open solicitation or the competitive grant process may be launched following the signing of the proposed MCC compact with Nepal. Please note that compact signing is subject to successful compact negotiation by the GON and MCC, as well as MCC Board approval.<br /><br />Please note that this is a Call for Ideas, not a solicitation - no contract or grant will be awarded under this Notice.&nbsp; No specific place for contract performance can presently be designated.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Aspen Helicopters, Inc. upon the basis of the authority provided at FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p><br />ERDC-CRREL intends to procure ground support (in the form of installation services) and flight support for research mapping instrumentation. The primary aspect of this project is focused on capturing 3D topographic mapping data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors over United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) owned reservoirs across the western and southwestern United States (Oxnard, CA, Fresno, CA, and Phoenix, AZ) during the current low-storage state induced by drought. The contractor shall perform the following tasks and provide the necessary support:</p>
<p>a) Provide an Office of Aircraft Services (OAS)-certified Partenavia P-68C high-wing aircraft with the following: <br /><br />a. FAA approved camera port in the belly of the fuselage with mounting holes for attaching the custom RS/GIS CX Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) system to the aircraft.<br /><br />b. An external GPS antenna mounting location on the top of the fuselage in line with the wings for the installation of the ALS GPS antenna.<br /><br />c. Access to two 28VDC power supply connections from within the passenger/sensor compartment. Connections should be a mil-spec connector. Contractor to provide details of this connection to RS/GIS CX. The power supply connections should be checked prior to installation of the ALS system and be in good working order.<br /><br />d. Reconfiguration of aircraft seating to accommodate the ALS system and a maximum of two system operators.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Installation and removal of RS/GIS CX ALS system in aircraft, charged at a&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixed&nbsp;hourly rate, including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Custom modification to camera port mounting plate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Modification to GPS antenna mounting plate for fit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Configuration of power and communication cables inside the aircraft<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Setup of Flight Management System (FMS) hardware inside the aircraft<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) An OAS-certified pilot capable of following planned flight lines using the RS/GIS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CX Flight Management System's pilot's display.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Ensure the aircraft has scheduled maintenance (50-hrs and 100-hrs) completed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prior to the start of each data acquisition campaign.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide scheduled maintenance (50-hrs and 100-hrs) as needed during data<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acquisition campaigns.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Complete the collection of all listed focus areas in cooperation with RS/GIS CX<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personnel (ALS system operator and ground crew).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g) Fly data acquisition flight plans at specified above ground level (AGL) altitudes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and airspeeds, as required by RS/GIS CX.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h) Arrange for use of Fixed-base Operator (FBO) locations in desired locations, per<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flight plans specified by RS/GIS CX.</p>
<p>Aspen Helicopters, Inc was identified as the only vendor capable of offering services and equipment meeting the requisite specifications and interoperability requirements with CRREL's existing ALS system and uniquely-designed mounting equipment. This includes a refined sensor package crafted through previous research efforts between Aspen Helicopters, CRREL, and USGS. Full interoperability is required to allow the system to take accurate LiDAR measurements and function seamlessly while deployed. As such, installing CRREL's specialized equipment on another aircraft is not feasible and would result in loss of functionality.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541360, which has a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Any interested party that believes they can fulfill this requirement should submit a capability statement to be reviewed. All submissions will be considered, however there is no guarantee that submissions in response to this notice will in any way alter the Government's acquisition strategy.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source contract to Berger Cummins Joint Venture (BCJV) to provide a contractor furnished, leased power plant and O&amp;M of the associated 5 megawatt medium voltage and secondary distribution system, currently installed at Camp Dwyer. There will be additional consideration to expand the capacity 2 megawatts, from 5 megawatts to 7 megawatts, and to purchase all the necessary equipment for a 5 megawatt or 7 megawatt power plant and distribution systems from the current contractor.<br /><br />Camp Dwyer is a military camp located in Helmand Province, in southern Afghanistan. Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of the 5 megawatt (MW) electrical power plant installed at Camp Dwyer is currently provided by Berger Cummins Joint Venture. (BCJV) under the predecessor task order W912BU-11-D-0011-0006, issued on a competitive basis under the FOB, Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). <br /><br />The action is pursuant to FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract. The current task order, W912BU-11-D-0011-0006, expires on 15 November 2016. The purpose of this contract is to provide Camp Dwyer with power generation for an additional six (6) months with two (2), three (3) month options. The Government intends to award and issue notice to proceed (NTP) on this contract by 15 November 2016. Award to any source other than BCJV would result in unacceptable power outages that will occur if this award was achieved through competition. If power outages occur at Camp Dwyer, there is a risk of loss of life and risk of failure to achieve mission critical objectives.<br /><br />Under the authority authorized by FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed towards BCJV. This notice of intent is being issued for information purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available. <br /><br />All comments or concerns in regards to this notice of intent shall be directed to Justin Chung at justin.chung@usace.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this notice of intent.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source: Pacific Bioscience Sequel System
<SOLNBR>W81XWH-17-T-0010
<RESPDATE>102016
<CONTACT>Lisa M. Zarick, Phone 3016192336, Email lisa.m.zarick.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This notice announces the intent by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) to purchase a DNA sequencing system directly from the manufacturer, Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., 1380 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, as prescribed in FAR 13.501(a)(1)(i). Specifically, the Government will purchase&nbsp;one (1) Sequel System manufactured by Pacific Biosciences on a sole source basis. The purchase of this DNA sequencing System will also include on-site training, a consumable starter kit, and an extended warranty and preventative maintenance agreement for a 12-month a base period and four 12-month option periods.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This DNA sequencing system is critical to the function of the Center for Genome Sciences, Molecular Translational Sciences division at USAMRIID, which is currently using the Pacific Bioscience PacBio RSII. The Pacific Biosciences Sequel sequencer is complementary to the current RSII as it uses the same proprietary approach, based on sequencing single DNA molecule: Single Molecule Real Time, or SMRT sequencing, which allows for full length transcripts and allows for simultaneous detection of epigenetic modifications. The Sequel system is covered by numerous patents owned by or licensed to Pacific Biosciences and therefore includes unique features that are not available from other DNA sequencing systems. For example, two key patented innovations are:<br /><br />- Zero-mode waveguide (ZMW) technology enables the isolation and real time detection of fluorescently-labeled base incorporation at the single-molecule level.<br />- Phospholinked nucleotides produce a completely natural DNA strand through fast, accurate, and processive DNA synthesis.</p>
<p>Pacific Biosciences's instruments generate super long reads of the average length of 10000-15000 nucleotides with longest reads exceeding 50000 nucleotides. It allows for high quality assembly of genomes with the high consensus accuracy and uniform coverage. SMRT technology has no biases and is equally good for sequencing high GC content and low complexity regions, which are the major limitations of other next generation sequencing technologies. Sequencing through long repetitive regions results in fewer or no gaps in genome assembly. Thanks to that, SMRT sequencing technology has become a gold standard for bacterial genomics.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.203(a). This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the award will be issued on a sole source basis, directly to Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Ms. Lisa Zarick at lisa.m.zarick.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>The Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Acquisition Directorate (AD) on behalf of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA) intends to exercise FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services. Due to the option not being evaluated at the time of award, this option is being exercised under authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) - FAR 6.302-1- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to M.C. Dean, Inc. of Sterling, VA. Performance will continue under the current contract (HQ0034-12-D-0004) which was awarded on 01 April 2012. The requirement is for the Integrated Security Services Contract (ISSC). The ISSC is a total system approach for providing integrated electronic and physical security systems for the Pentagon Reservation, Mark Center, Defense Health Headquarters (DHHQ), DoD leased facilities, and Raven Rock Mountain Complex (RRMC) in Adams County, PA as defined in 32 CFR 234.1. <br /><br />This contract is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Performance of the current contract period concludes on 31 October 2016. The extension is necessary to avoid a gap in services as the re-compete is still in source selection (HQ0034-16-R-0192).<br /><br />The period of performance for the FAR 52.217-8 will be up to 6-months allowing the Government to extend the current contract from 01 November 2016 - 30 April 2017 should the full 6-months be necessary. <br /><br />The agency shall make publicly available the justification required by 6.303-1 as required by 10 U.S.C. 2304(1) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(f) within 14 days after award of the extension. <br /><br />The point of contact for this action is Lydia Richards who can be reached at lydia.l.richards.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. AG-64PP-S-17-0001 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-88. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 221114. For a small company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees or less. The Cropping Systems and Water Quality Research Unit (CSWQRU) in Columbia, Missouri require a stand-alone solar-photovoltaic power system for a remote research building. There is no anticipated need for additional systems at a later time. This system needs to run year around, including providing enough power during the winter to keep the building and the equipment inside from freezing. We have calculated this power requirement at 600 Kwh/month. <br />The system shall include a backup generator which must be able to be auto-started, if backup power is required. The entire system, including batteries, inverter, and control components will be housed outdoors, so weatherproof housings and wiring connections are required as part of the system. The exception is that the customer will provide the housing for the battery bank.<br />The customer will assemble and install the system onsite - installation services are not part of this request. To facilitate installation, components should be pre-assembled and pre-wired to the extent practical. This will assist with the speed of the installation and the quality of the installation. The system/parts must meet the following requirements:<br />Requirements for the off grid solar system: <br />1. Capable of providing 600Kwh/month year around <br />2. Solar panel array with a minimum rating of 6.7 kW.<br />a. This assumes a winter-time capacity factor of 12.5% for our location. <br />3. All required mounting frames, clips, hardware, and brackets to be provided. We will provide the posts for mounting above ground<br />4. Connecting cables, breakers, and other wiring and electrical components required to assemble the system (for panels, batteries, inverter, and breaker box)<br />5. Solar combiner boxes and breakers as required<br />a. Breakers need to be rated to break the full rated load at the rated voltage repeatedly, with NO DAMAGE<br />b. The breakers need to be rated for use within the solar industry<br />6. Battery system:<br />a. 16, 6 volt deep cycle batteries <br />i. Minimum of 370 amp-hour rated at the 20 hour rate<br />ii. Deep cycle flooded battery, as staff will be available to maintain the batteries<br />b. Charge Controllers as required<br />i. Operate at 150 V, Rated at 96 amps max current out<br />ii. Type 1 environmental rating<br />iii. DC - ground fault protection and battery temperature correction sensor<br />iv. Must work with the above battery bank system<br />c. Surge suppressor surge protection devices as required to provide protection to service panels and load centers<br />i. Needs to work on AC &amp; DC systems at 120 &amp; 240 VAC circuits<br />ii. Rated for up to 300 volts<br />7. Inverter:<br />a. Auto start feature for starting a generator <br />b. 120/240 VAC compatible<br />c. Solar-system rated sinewave inverter, 4000 watts minimum, 48 VDC rated at minimum <br />d. Needs to be housed in a weatherproof box<br />e. Needs to have as much wiring already completed as possible <br />8. Generator: <br />a. Needs to be auto started by inverter<br />b. Would be used during times of low power output by the batteries (as backup)<br />c. Large enough to power the system described<br />9. Wiring diagram, plus any components not mentioned that may be needed to make this system work<br />10. Minimum one year warranty on all components<br />11.

<p><br />The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p><br />When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>

<DESC>Description of the Requirement: The scope of this effort is to provide technical support for Hostile Forces Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL) Field Service Representatives (FSRs), Operational Planners and to provide HF-TTL lessons-learned and new equipment training support to United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) forces. Specifically, the FSR requirement is for specialized tactical surveillance equipment support to Special Operations Forces (SOF) military units, SOF Component Headquarters, and Theater Special Operations<br />Commands (TSOCs). This technical support also includes providing direct HF-TTL lessons-learned, operational training and technical support personnel to Continental United States (CONUS)-based operators and deploying units for the duration of their rotations, quick-reaction support, and general technical support to the USSOCOM HF-TTL Program Office.
<p>This is solicited and will be awarded on a Full and Open Competition basis.<br /><br />This is a formal Request for Proposal (RFP). USSOCOM is seeking proposals from sources that can provide FH-TTL services (NAICS Code 541990) in support of various units for USSOCOM.<br /><br />Attached to this Formal RFP are the HF-TTL solicitation attachments. The statements of work are classified documents and will not be posted to this site. <br /><br />To gain Restricted Access to the CLASSIFIED documents, Contractor Personnel must be approved by DSS (and confirmed by USSOCOM) to have Top Secret Facility Clearance and the ability to store CLASSIFIED material up to the SECRET Level. Requesters must provide their Cage Code for verification which can take up to 24 hours.&nbsp; Requesters shall also provide POC name, phone number, email address and classified email address as applicable.<br /><br />ALL interested Offerors shall have Top Secret Facility Clearance and Secret Storage in place before receiving all RFP Classified and Unclassified HF-TTL documents. Under no circumstance will interested Prime Contractor Offerors be able to utilize a potential Sub-Contractor's Classified Storage capability as proof of classified storage capability.<br />&nbsp;<br />USSOCOM will not provide any sponsorship for Security Clearances to enable access the CLASSIFIED portion of this requirement. A prerequisite to this requirement is that all interested vendors that wish to propose for the Prime Contractor role MUST demonstrate DSS approved CLASSIFIED Storage Capability and Individual Security Clearances. Failure to do so will cause the Proposal to be rejected, and will not be evaluated further, and therefore not eligible for award.<br />&nbsp;<br />Upon successful confirmation of clearances and storage capability, USSOCOM will mail all CLASSIFIED documents to the approved physical ship-to address location of the interested vendor. Please note, vendor's whose classified address includes a Post Office Box, receipt of Classified material can take up to 14 days after verification from USSOCOM.</p>
<p>**Questions regarding this RFP must be emailed (in writing) and submitted to the Contracting Officer (addresses below). Oral requests (e.g. phone call) for information will be re-directed to provide email correspondence, for documentation purposes.**<br />Only unclassified questions may be transmitted.

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers.

Eggert, Det 8 AFRL/RVKVB, Kirtland AFB, NM, Phone 505-846-7603, Email: Francis.Eggert@us.af.mil .</p>
<p>This CALL is specifically requesting potential Offeror(s) to provide proposals to the topic below.</p>
<p>I. Topic 3: Topic Area 3- Cold Atom Precision Timing and Inertial Navigation</p>
<p>From the BAA Full Text: Proposals are sought to improve The Cold Atom Precision Timing and Inertial Navigation area goal is atom interferometry, robust inertial sensors uniquely poised to dramatically shift the advantage of the future warfighter. Atom interferometers have previously demonstrated accuracies surpassing state of the art ring laser gyroscopes. Many future navigation systems will benefit greatly from unaided precision pointing and navigation. This objective also includes precision timing to include optical clocks, cold clocks, and other precise timing technologies</p>
<p>A development effort is being considered to develop and demonstrate robust precision radiation hardened laser sources for use in atomic systems such as atomic frequency standards for space-based and strategic systems.</p>
<p>Technical responses are expected to demonstrate a detailed understanding of continuous wave (CW), narrow line-width lasers intended for alkali and alkali-earth atomic systems, particularly Rubidium (Rb), Cesium (Cs), Strontium (Sr), and Calcium (Ca). The laser system desired shall output on the order of 500 mW of CW power, be initially space radiation hardened with a feasible path to hostile radiation hardening, and designed in such a way to survive launch and operate on-board a space payload in Middle-Earth Orbit (MEO) with a feasible path to strategic system applications. It is anticipated that the initial task for this development will be a trade study of potential laser system architectures at any or all of the following frequency standards listed below:</p>
<p>Element Wavelength(s) [nm]<br />Rubidium 778, 1556<br />Cesium 852<br />Strontium 461, 689, 922, 1378<br />Calcium 423, 657, 846, 1314<br /><br />** (See the PDF version in the Attachments for a full table)</p>
<p>The trade study will identify system architectures which can fundamentally meet or exceed performance requirements under radiation and space launch environments. Subsequent tasks include the design, construction and testing of a Brassboard laser system. The system will be tested for both survivability and performance under a variety of natural and man-made radiation events including prompt dose, extended exposure of proton, gamma ray and x-ray radiation. Relative launch environments levels (e.g., vibration, shock, g-loading, and thermal vacuum) will be provided by AFRL separately upon request. While the Brassboard units are not expected to be flight-qualified, demonstration of launch suitability is a primary objective.</p>
<p>Objective: Advance technology through design, development and demonstration of continuous wave (CW) lasers intended for high performance atomic systems.</p>

<DESC>The Government received a question from a prospective offeror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The question and answer was as follows:
<p>Ship name: YRR-11</p>
<p>Work item no. 512-11-001</p>
<p>Component name: Filter Standard 14AF</p>
<p>Drawing/tech manual: 501-1131922 Rev C</p>
<p>Applicable sheets/paragraphs: General Notes 1 &amp; 2</p>
<p><br />Background: The manufacturer is no longer available IAW the work spec and drawings and its sister company has submitted a no bid due to the manufacturer in Canada is also no longer available. Prospective offeror requests to see if the filter media is in the stock system or if it is&nbsp;permissible to&nbsp;use "Scott Foam Filter Media" as an alternate substitute. <br /><br /><br />Question: What is equivalent filter media? YRR-11 is a retired nuke valve barge so the filter media per drawing may not be required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer: Scott foam filter media is not permitted. Use of 0.011" diameter wire mesh filter media, made of CRES per ASTM A167 (similar to PC 2 of DWG 804-1170895 class 3) or equivalent is acceptable. Distribution of drawing no. 804-1170895 is available&nbsp;to authorized&nbsp;DoD contractors only, and will be made available upon request.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>(a) In accordance with Section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235), Government agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.
(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.
(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. <BR> <BR>Invoicing Procedures - Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (a)	Definitions.  As used in this clause-
(1)	Contract financing payment has the meaning given in FAR 32.001. (2)	Invoice payment has the meaning given in FAR 32.001. (3)	Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the contractor under this contract.
(b)	Electronic Payment Requests.  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, the contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form.  Purchases paid with a Government-wide commercial purchase card are considered to be an electronic transaction for purposes of this clause, and therefore no additional electronic invoice submission is required.
An original invoice shall be prepared and submitted to the Department of Labor (DOL) by email to:
DOL-BLS@quickpay.dol.gov
(c)	Data Transmission.  A contractor must ensure that the data transmission method and format comply with the following provisions:
(1)	The contractor shall: a.	Address the invoice to the appropriate e-mail address specified in the contract. b.	Submit the invoice via attachment in PDF or TIFF format. c.	Submit only one invoice per electronic submittal.  d.

Submit a copy of the email with the attached invoice to the contracting officer?s representative (COR) at the COR email address specified in the contract. f.	Before sending another e-mail with the same invoice attachment, confirm whether DOL has already responded and/or whether you have received a success or failure response to your submission.  
(2)	The contractor MUST NOT: a.	Submit an invoice that exceeds the size limit of 16 megabytes (approximately 400-500 pages).  However, if the invoice exceed this limit, a summary invoice attachment of less than 16 megabytes should be e-mailed to the payment e-mail address above; while the detailed invoice, including any supplemental information, shall be sent to the COR or other representative at the address. b.	Submit an invoice that is heavy in shading or color. 1.	An e-mailed PDF image cannot have any text that has a background with any color other than white.

c.	Submit more than one attachment, as subsequent attachments will not be recognized. d.	Submit more than one invoice in a single attachment. e.	Attempt to use the ?Recall or Resend? email message feature. <BR> <BR>(d)	General Information.

Inquiries regarding invoices should be e-mailed to BLSInvoiceInquiry@dol.gov.  The relevant invoice must be attached to the inquiry e-mail and the subject line of the e-mail must state ?INQUIRY,? followed by the information described in paragraph (1) d. above.

<DESC> <br>  <br> AMENDMENT 1 TO SOURCES SOUGHT OPPORTUNITY NUMBER W900KK-15-R-0042, August 13, 2015. <br>  <br> 1.	The Response Date has been changed from August 17, 2015 to August 24, 2015. <br>  <br> 2.	INDUSTRY DAY: <br>  <br> An Industry Day, for the CCTT PDSS effort, has been scheduled for Thursday, September 17, 2015, 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. in the Partnership III Building, Conference Room 321 located at 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826.  Due to limited parking in the Partnership III parking lot, all visitors are requested to park in large parking lot on the corner of Science Drive and Technology Parkway. <br>  <br> Attendees shall pre-register for the CCTT PDSS Industry Day by providing the company name, attendees name(s), main Point Of Contact (POC), phone number and email address to Carolyn Wardell, Contract Specialist, at carolyn.j.wardell.civ@mail.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on August 20, 2015.   <br>  <br>  <br> When pre-registering, please indicate your firm's desire to participate in a 20-minute one-on-one session which will be scheduled on September 17, 2015, between 12:00 noon and 5:00 p.m.  Your company's POC will be notified of your scheduled 20-minute one-on-one session with members of the Government's integrated project team. The one-on-one sessions will be held in person and/or via telecom. <br> _______END OF AMENDMENT 1 -------- <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. All firms responding to this SSN are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only.  This is strictly market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.     <br>    <br>  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code contemplated for this acquisition is 541330, Engineering Services.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541330 $38.5M.  <br>    <br>  The Close Combat Tactical Trainers (CCTT) Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) requirement was previously awarded as a competitive action under the provisions of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637) and in accordance with (IAW) FAR 19.8 -- Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program).  As a result of the Class Deviation, issued pursuant to the Dynalantic Corporation v. DOD Settlement Agreement dated January 30, 2014, the Government anticipates this effort will be removed from the 8(a) Business Development program.    <br>    <br>  It is the Government's intention to solicit this requirement as a Small Business Set-Aside IAW FAR 19.5 - Set-Asides for Small Businesses; however the current capabilities of industry, to include large and small business, must be confirmed.  As such, all eligible large and small businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from respondents as a result of this SSN.    <br>    <br>  The intent of this notice is to determine the availability of qualified sources technically capable of providing the requirements described in Attachment 1 - DRAFT PWS PEO-STRI-15-W098 PDSS 2017 and the Additional Program Requirements below:  <br>    <br>  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI has a requirement to provide PDSS for the fielded CCTT systems.  This effort will consist of PDSS primarily for the CCTT and Dismounted Soldier Training Systems (DSTS).  <br>    <br>  CCTT is a collective training device composed of three systems (CCTT, RVTT and DSTS).  CCTT collectively trains Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mechanized Infantry, and Armored Reconnaissance units from Squad through Battalion/Squadron level, to include their staffs in order to increase and sustain readiness.  The primary training audience operates from immersive full-crew simulators, mock-up command posts, and live battalion command posts to train in combined arms maneuver and wide area security tactical missions, conduct mission rehearsal, and enhance live training.   <br>    <br>  PDSS for CCTT is responsible for providing all aspects of software support to CCTT and its projects/subsystems in order to maintain its main mission of providing a virtual collective training capability, as well as the obsolescence of CCTT and DSTS hardware.  <br>    <br>  The system contains a mix of current and legacy custom built, COTS and GOTS applications from multiple vendors including other Government agencies. It will require complex configuration management, including development and test of multiple software baselines in tandem. It will require software and hardware installation and support for more than 500 simulators at over 40 sites both CONUS and OCONUS. It will require the maintenance and operation of a development lab with no less than eight highly complex manned modules to support the overarching PDSS requirements.   <br>    <br>  This effort will consist of PDSS Basic services including Program Management Office (PMO) oversight as well as engineering, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, logistics, and maintaining the various lab assets.  This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, supporting Interoperability between training systems, maintaining Cybersecurity and Authority to Operate (ATO) and fielding approved changes to CCTT hardware and software baseline accomplished through PDSS.  <br>    <br>  This effort includes the integration and support of Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) development and LVC-IA products as directed by the Government. This effort includes the integration and development of OneSAF products and the integration of SE Core databases and moving models.   <br>    <br>  This effort includes various other efforts such as Subject Matter Expert (SME) consultation, Training Services, help desk support, and required contractor logistics support.  <br>    <br>  Contractors shall note that due to the nature of the data and software that is going to be dealt with for this effort, there will be distribution agreements addressing security/export compliance requirements that must be met, as such there will be an exclusion of Foreign Companies/Foreign Nationals.  All personnel must have a secret clearance to work on the CCTT PDSS contract and development will be required in a controlled environment.  <br>    <br>  Contractor will develop and support software using non-proprietary components.  All software is to be developed and modified to provide Government Purpose Rights.  Any contractor presenting a proposal using proprietary components/software will not be considered for this effort.  The software build environment must be self-contained, not dependent on any capital assets.  <br>    <br>  The information above does not preclude the use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software in your particular solution.  However, the intent behind requiring GPR is to allow the Government to pursue future upgrades/modifications and Life Cycle Support in a competitive environment.  Excessive use of COTS that contain restrictive rights or recurring licensing agreements does not support this intent and may be considered a weakness in contractor approaches should this effort progress to Request for Proposals.  <br>    <br>  Transition from the current PDSS contractor to the new contractor must not cause disruption to other ongoing efforts supported by PDSS.  <br>    <br>  The CCTT PDSS must be located in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area and effort must be performed in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area. This is required in order to have access to and connectivity with other PM ITE programs; and facilitate integration support with SE Core and LVC-IA.  <br>    <br>  The facility must be able to support classified and unclassified work.  <br>    <br>  The facility must provide high bay space, power, network access, etc. for the PDSS assets to include at least each configuration of manned modules that are fielded.  <br>    <br>  QUANTITIES: Core PDSS tasks and technical services include:  <br>    <br>  Program Management Office (PMO)  <br>  Hardware and Software Baseline Management  <br>  Fielding of new hardware and software baselines  <br>  Configuration Management of all software and the complete library of all design documentation, drawings, TDP, manuals, etc.  <br>  Cybersecurity design, implementation, patching, accreditation  <br>  Discrepancy Report management  <br>  User Support - help desk for site Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) crew both CONUS and OCONUS  <br>  Training Assistance Services for site CLS crews or local unit as requested by the Government  <br>  Support to LVC-IA integration and test  <br>  Support to SE Core integration and test  <br>  Support to OneSAF integration and test  <br>  Support to interoperability integration and test, with systems such as Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and Games for Training (GFT)  <br>  Obsolescence and technology insertion efforts  <br>  Operation and maintenance of PDSS assets  <br>    <br>  ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:    <br>    <br>  The current CCTT PDSS Lab is approximately 21,850 square feet of which 9,966 square feet is allocated for lab space and 11,884 square feet is allocated for office space.  The contractor shall provide a CCTT PDSS Lab facility that is equal to or larger than the current square footage.  <br>    <br>  At the Government's request, the contractor shall procure field equipment to support CCTT tech refresh or concurrency upgrades under this effort.   <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates future requirements may include the PDSS for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) database production capabilities and other PM ITE programs that require PDSS activities.  <br>    <br>  INDUSTRY DAY:  <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates holding an Industry Day event, details will be provided at a later date under this Opportunity Number, W900KK-15-R-0042.  <br>    <br>  ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the CCTT PDSS effort. The Government anticipates that the requirements will be fulfilled via task orders under a single source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in accordance with FAR Part 15.

It does not constitute a Solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. All firms responding to this SSN are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only.  This is strictly market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.      <br>      <br>   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code contemplated for this acquisition is 541330, Engineering Services.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541330 $38.5M.   <br>      <br>   The Close Combat Tactical Trainers (CCTT) Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) requirement was previously awarded as a competitive action under the provisions of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637) and in accordance with (IAW) FAR 19.8 -- Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program).  As a result of the Class Deviation, issued pursuant to the Dynalantic Corporation v. DOD Settlement Agreement dated January 30, 2014, the Government anticipates this effort will be removed from the 8(a) Business Development program.     <br>      <br>   It is the Government's intention to solicit this requirement as a Small Business Set-Aside IAW FAR 19.5 - Set-Asides for Small Businesses; however the current capabilities of industry, to include large and small business, must be confirmed.  As such, all eligible large and small businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from respondents as a result of this SSN.     <br>      <br>   The intent of this notice is to determine the availability of qualified sources technically capable of providing the requirements described in Attachment 1 - DRAFT PWS PEO-STRI-15-W098 PDSS 2017 and the Additional Program Requirements below:   <br>      <br>   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI has a requirement to provide PDSS for the fielded CCTT systems.  This effort will consist of PDSS primarily for the CCTT and Dismounted Soldier Training Systems (DSTS).   <br>      <br>   CCTT is a collective training device composed of three systems (CCTT, RVTT and DSTS).  CCTT collectively trains Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mechanized Infantry, and Armored Reconnaissance units from Squad through Battalion/Squadron level, to include their staffs in order to increase and sustain readiness.  The primary training audience operates from immersive full-crew simulators, mock-up command posts, and live battalion command posts to train in combined arms maneuver and wide area security tactical missions, conduct mission rehearsal, and enhance live training.    <br>      <br>   PDSS for CCTT is responsible for providing all aspects of software support to CCTT and its projects/subsystems in order to maintain its main mission of providing a virtual collective training capability, as well as the obsolescence of CCTT and DSTS hardware.   <br>      <br>   The system contains a mix of current and legacy custom built, COTS and GOTS applications from multiple vendors including other Government agencies. It will require complex configuration management, including development and test of multiple software baselines in tandem. It will require software and hardware installation and support for more than 500 simulators at over 40 sites both CONUS and OCONUS. It will require the maintenance and operation of a development lab with no less than eight highly complex manned modules to support the overarching PDSS requirements.    <br>      <br>   This effort will consist of PDSS Basic services including Program Management Office (PMO) oversight as well as engineering, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, logistics, and maintaining the various lab assets.  This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, supporting Interoperability between training systems, maintaining Cybersecurity and Authority to Operate (ATO) and fielding approved changes to CCTT hardware and software baseline accomplished through PDSS.   <br>      <br>   This effort includes the integration and support of Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) development and LVC-IA products as directed by the Government. This effort includes the integration and development of OneSAF products and the integration of SE Core databases and moving models.    <br>      <br>   This effort includes various other efforts such as Subject Matter Expert (SME) consultation, Training Services, help desk support, and required contractor logistics support.   <br>      <br>   Contractors shall note that due to the nature of the data and software that is going to be dealt with for this effort, there will be distribution agreements addressing security/export compliance requirements that must be met, as such there will be an exclusion of Foreign Companies/Foreign Nationals.  All personnel must have a secret clearance to work on the CCTT PDSS contract and development will be required in a controlled environment.   <br>      <br>   Contractor will develop and support software using non-proprietary components.  All software is to be developed and modified to provide Government Purpose Rights.  Any contractor presenting a proposal using proprietary components/software will not be considered for this effort.  The software build environment must be self-contained, not dependent on any capital assets.   <br>      <br>   The information above does not preclude the use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software in your particular solution.  However, the intent behind requiring GPR is to allow the Government to pursue future upgrades/modifications and Life Cycle Support in a competitive environment.  Excessive use of COTS that contain restrictive rights or recurring licensing agreements does not support this intent and may be considered a weakness in contractor approaches should this effort progress to Request for Proposals.   <br>      <br>   Transition from the current PDSS contractor to the new contractor must not cause disruption to other ongoing efforts supported by PDSS.   <br>      <br>   The CCTT PDSS must be located in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area and effort must be performed in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area. This is required in order to have access to and connectivity with other PM ITE programs; and facilitate integration support with SE Core and LVC-IA.   <br>      <br>   The facility must be able to support classified and unclassified work.   <br>      <br>   The facility must provide high bay space, power, network access, etc. for the PDSS assets to include at least each configuration of manned modules that are fielded.   <br>      <br>   QUANTITIES: Core PDSS tasks and technical services include:   <br>      <br>   Program Management Office (PMO)   <br>   Hardware and Software Baseline Management   <br>   Fielding of new hardware and software baselines   <br>   Configuration Management of all software and the complete library of all design documentation, drawings, TDP, manuals, etc.   <br>   Cybersecurity design, implementation, patching, accreditation   <br>   Discrepancy Report management   <br>   User Support - help desk for site Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) crew both CONUS and OCONUS   <br>   Training Assistance Services for site CLS crews or local unit as requested by the Government   <br>   Support to LVC-IA integration and test   <br>   Support to SE Core integration and test   <br>   Support to OneSAF integration and test   <br>   Support to interoperability integration and test, with systems such as Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and Games for Training (GFT)   <br>   Obsolescence and technology insertion efforts   <br>   Operation and maintenance of PDSS assets   <br>      <br>   ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:     <br>      <br>   The current CCTT PDSS Lab is approximately 21,850 square feet of which 9,966 square feet is allocated for lab space and 11,884 square feet is allocated for office space.  The contractor shall provide a CCTT PDSS Lab facility that is equal to or larger than the current square footage.   <br>      <br>   At the Government's request, the contractor shall procure field equipment to support CCTT tech refresh or concurrency upgrades under this effort.    <br>      <br>   The Government anticipates future requirements may include the PDSS for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) database production capabilities and other PM ITE programs that require PDSS activities.   <br>      <br>   INDUSTRY DAY:   <br>      <br>   The Government anticipates holding an Industry Day event, details will be provided at a later date under this Opportunity Number, W900KK-15-R-0042.   <br>      <br>   ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the CCTT PDSS effort. The Government anticipates that the requirements will be fulfilled via task orders under a single source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-Off basis.     <br>      <br>   Task orders will be issued from the single award IDIQ contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost and/or Time and Materials (T&M) Contract Line Item Numbers for technical services.  The Period of Performance will be for a one-year base period with four one-year options. Issues to be considered in the acquisition strategy for this effort include the following:   <br>      <br>   The Government intends to include the following local and federal clauses in the Request for Proposal:     <br>      <br>   5152.209-5003 -- ORGANIZATION CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (SERVICES) (PEOSTRI) (SEP 2006).

It does not constitute a Solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. All firms responding to this SSN are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only.  This is strictly market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.       <br>        <br>    The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code contemplated for this acquisition is 541330, Engineering Services.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541330 $38.5M.    <br>        <br>    The Close Combat Tactical Trainers (CCTT) Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) requirement was previously awarded as a competitive action under the provisions of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637) and in accordance with (IAW) FAR 19.8 -- Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program).  As a result of the Class Deviation, issued pursuant to the Dynalantic Corporation v. DOD Settlement Agreement dated January 30, 2014, the Government anticipates this effort will be removed from the 8(a) Business Development program.      <br>        <br>    It is the Government's intention to solicit this requirement as a Small Business Set-Aside IAW FAR 19.5 - Set-Asides for Small Businesses; however the current capabilities of industry, to include large and small business, must be confirmed.  As such, all eligible large and small businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from respondents as a result of this SSN.      <br>        <br>    The intent of this notice is to determine the availability of qualified sources technically capable of providing the requirements described in Attachment 1 - DRAFT PWS PEO-STRI-15-W098 PDSS 2017 and the Additional Program Requirements below:    <br>        <br>    PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  PEO STRI has a requirement to provide PDSS for the fielded CCTT systems.  This effort will consist of PDSS primarily for the CCTT and Dismounted Soldier Training Systems (DSTS).    <br>        <br>    CCTT is a collective training device composed of three systems (CCTT, RVTT and DSTS).  CCTT collectively trains Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mechanized Infantry, and Armored Reconnaissance units from Squad through Battalion/Squadron level, to include their staffs in order to increase and sustain readiness.  The primary training audience operates from immersive full-crew simulators, mock-up command posts, and live battalion command posts to train in combined arms maneuver and wide area security tactical missions, conduct mission rehearsal, and enhance live training.     <br>        <br>    PDSS for CCTT is responsible for providing all aspects of software support to CCTT and its projects/subsystems in order to maintain its main mission of providing a virtual collective training capability, as well as the obsolescence of CCTT and DSTS hardware.    <br>        <br>    The system contains a mix of current and legacy custom built, COTS and GOTS applications from multiple vendors including other Government agencies. It will require complex configuration management, including development and test of multiple software baselines in tandem. It will require software and hardware installation and support for more than 500 simulators at over 40 sites both CONUS and OCONUS. It will require the maintenance and operation of a development lab with no less than eight highly complex manned modules to support the overarching PDSS requirements.     <br>        <br>    This effort will consist of PDSS Basic services including Program Management Office (PMO) oversight as well as engineering, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, logistics, and maintaining the various lab assets.  This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, supporting Interoperability between training systems, maintaining Cybersecurity and Authority to Operate (ATO) and fielding approved changes to CCTT hardware and software baseline accomplished through PDSS.    <br>        <br>    This effort includes the integration and support of Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) development and LVC-IA products as directed by the Government. This effort includes the integration and development of OneSAF products and the integration of SE Core databases and moving models.     <br>        <br>    This effort includes various other efforts such as Subject Matter Expert (SME) consultation, Training Services, help desk support, and required contractor logistics support.    <br>        <br>    Contractors shall note that due to the nature of the data and software that is going to be dealt with for this effort, there will be distribution agreements addressing security/export compliance requirements that must be met, as such there will be an exclusion of Foreign Companies/Foreign Nationals.  All personnel must have a secret clearance to work on the CCTT PDSS contract and development will be required in a controlled environment.    <br>        <br>    Contractor will develop and support software using non-proprietary components.  All software is to be developed and modified to provide Government Purpose Rights.  Any contractor presenting a proposal using proprietary components/software will not be considered for this effort.  The software build environment must be self-contained, not dependent on any capital assets.    <br>        <br>    The information above does not preclude the use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software in your particular solution.  However, the intent behind requiring GPR is to allow the Government to pursue future upgrades/modifications and Life Cycle Support in a competitive environment.  Excessive use of COTS that contain restrictive rights or recurring licensing agreements does not support this intent and may be considered a weakness in contractor approaches should this effort progress to Request for Proposals.    <br>        <br>    Transition from the current PDSS contractor to the new contractor must not cause disruption to other ongoing efforts supported by PDSS.    <br>        <br>    The CCTT PDSS must be located in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area and effort must be performed in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area. This is required in order to have access to and connectivity with other PM ITE programs; and facilitate integration support with SE Core and LVC-IA.    <br>        <br>    The facility must be able to support classified and unclassified work.    <br>        <br>    The facility must provide high bay space, power, network access, etc. for the PDSS assets to include at least each configuration of manned modules that are fielded.    <br>        <br>    QUANTITIES: Core PDSS tasks and technical services include:    <br>        <br>    Program Management Office (PMO)    <br>    Hardware and Software Baseline Management    <br>    Fielding of new hardware and software baselines    <br>    Configuration Management of all software and the complete library of all design documentation, drawings, TDP, manuals, etc.    <br>    Cybersecurity design, implementation, patching, accreditation    <br>    Discrepancy Report management    <br>    User Support - help desk for site Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) crew both CONUS and OCONUS    <br>    Training Assistance Services for site CLS crews or local unit as requested by the Government    <br>    Support to LVC-IA integration and test    <br>    Support to SE Core integration and test    <br>    Support to OneSAF integration and test    <br>    Support to interoperability integration and test, with systems such as Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and Games for Training (GFT)    <br>    Obsolescence and technology insertion efforts    <br>    Operation and maintenance of PDSS assets    <br>        <br>    ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:      <br>        <br>    The current CCTT PDSS Lab is approximately 21,850 square feet of which 9,966 square feet is allocated for lab space and 11,884 square feet is allocated for office space.  The contractor shall provide a CCTT PDSS Lab facility that is equal to or larger than the current square footage.    <br>        <br>    At the Government's request, the contractor shall procure field equipment to support CCTT tech refresh or concurrency upgrades under this effort.     <br>        <br>    The Government anticipates future requirements may include the PDSS for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) database production capabilities and other PM ITE programs that require PDSS activities.    <br>        <br>    INDUSTRY DAY:    <br>        <br>    The Government anticipates holding an Industry Day event, details will be provided at a later date under this Opportunity Number, W900KK-15-R-0042.    <br>        <br>    ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the CCTT PDSS effort.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 5 TO SOURCES SOUGHT OPPORTUNITY NUMBER W900KK-16-R-0047 PREVIOUSLY W900KK-15-R-0042 February 29, 2016
<p>1. The Sources Sought Notice (SSN)/Solicitation Number has changed. SSN/Solicitation Number W900KK-16-R-0047 supersedes SSN/Solicitation Number W900KK-15-R-0042 as of this posting. All future SSNs, amendments, correspondence and potential solicitation documents related to the Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) requirement shall reference W900KK-16-R-0047.<br /><br />2. On February 19, 2016, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) made a determination to decline the release of the PDSS CCTT requirement from the 8(a) Business Development (BD) program. In accordance with (IAW) 13 CFR 124.504 (d) "...where a procurement is awarded as an 8(a) contract, its follow-on or renewable acquisition must remain in the 8(a) BD program unless SBA agrees to release it for non-8(a) competition."</p>
<p>3. As a result of the SBA's determination, it is the Government's intention to solicit the CCTT PDSS requirement as a competitive action under the provisions of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637) and IAW FAR 19.8 -- Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program).</p>
<p>4. THE INTENT OF THIS NOTICE IS TO DETERMINE THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED 8(A) SOURCES TECHNICALLY CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE REVISED ATTACHMENT 1 - DRAFT-2 PWS PEO-STRI-15-W098 PDSS 2017-FEB2016 AND THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS BELOW:</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: PEO STRI has a requirement to provide PDSS for the fielded CCTT systems. This effort will consist of PDSS primarily for the CCTT and Dismounted Soldier Training Systems (DSTS).</p>
<p>CCTT is a collective training device composed of three systems (CCTT, RVTT and DSTS). CCTT collectively trains Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mechanized Infantry, and Armored Reconnaissance units from Squad through Battalion/Squadron level, to include their staffs in order to increase and sustain readiness. The primary training audience operates from immersive full-crew simulators, mock-up command posts, and live battalion command posts to train in combined arms maneuver and wide area security tactical missions, conduct mission rehearsal, and enhance live training.</p>
<p>PDSS FOR CCTT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING ALL ASPECTS OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE SUPPORT TO CCTT AND ITS PROJECTS/SUBSYSTEMS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS MAIN MISSION OF PROVIDING A VIRTUAL COLLECTIVE TRAINING CAPABILITY, AS WELL AS THE OBSOLESCENCE OF CCTT AND DSTS HARDWARE.</p>
<p>The system contains a mix of current and legacy custom built, COTS and GOTS applications from multiple vendors including other Government agencies. It will require complex configuration management, including development and test of multiple software baselines in tandem. It will require software and hardware installation and support for more than 500 simulators at over 40 sites both CONUS and OCONUS. It will require the maintenance and operation of a development lab with no less than eight highly complex manned modules to support the overarching PDSS requirements.</p>
<p>This effort will consist of PDSS Basic services including Program Management Office (PMO) oversight as well as engineering, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, logistics, and maintaining the various lab assets. This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, supporting Interoperability between training systems, maintaining Cybersecurity and Authority to Operate (ATO) and fielding approved changes to CCTT hardware and software baseline accomplished through PDSS.</p>
<p>This effort includes the integration and support of Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) development and LVC-IA products as directed by the Government. This effort includes the integration and development of OneSAF products and the integration of SE Core databases and moving models.</p>
<p>This effort includes various other efforts such as Subject Matter Expert (SME) consultation, Training Services, help desk support, and required contractor logistics support.</p>
<p>Contractors shall note that due to the nature of the data and software that is going to be dealt with for this effort, there will be distribution agreements addressing security/export compliance requirements that must be met, as such there will be an exclusion of Foreign Companies/Foreign Nationals. All personnel must have a secret clearance to work on the CCTT PDSS contract and development will be required in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>Contractor will develop and support software using non-proprietary components. All software is to be developed and modified to provide Government Purpose Rights. Any contractor presenting a proposal using proprietary components/software will not be considered for this effort. The software build environment must be self-contained, not dependent on any capital assets.</p>
<p>The information above does not preclude the use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software in your particular solution. However, the intent behind requiring GPR is to allow the Government to pursue future upgrades/modifications and Life Cycle Support in a competitive environment. Excessive use of COTS that contain restrictive rights or recurring licensing agreements does not support this intent and may be considered a weakness in contractor approaches should this effort progress to Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>Transition from the current PDSS contractor to the new contractor must not cause disruption to other ongoing efforts supported by PDSS.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO PROVIDE AN ASSUMABLE LEASE FOR THE CONTRACTOR'S FACILITY REQUIREMENTS AS DEFINED IN THE REVISED ATTACHMENT 1 - DRAFT-2 PWS PEO-STRI-15-W098 PDSS 2017 FEB2016.</p>

<p>1. The Sources Sought Notice (SSN)/Solicitation Number has changed. SSN/Solicitation Number W900KK-16-R-0047 supersedes SSN/Solicitation Number W900KK-15-R-0042 as of this posting. All future SSNs, amendments, correspondence and potential solicitation documents related to the Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) requirement shall reference W900KK-16-R-0047.<br /><br />2. On February 19, 2016, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) made a determination to decline the release of the PDSS CCTT requirement from the 8(a) Business Development (BD) program. In accordance with (IAW) 13 CFR 124.504 (d) "...where a procurement is awarded as an 8(a) contract, its follow-on or renewable acquisition must remain in the 8(a) BD program unless SBA agrees to release it for non-8(a) competition."</p>
<p>3. As a result of the SBA's determination, it is the Government's intention to solicit the CCTT PDSS requirement as a competitive action under the provisions of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637) and IAW FAR 19.8 -- Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program).</p>
<p>4. THE INTENT OF THIS NOTICE IS TO DETERMINE THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED 8(A) SOURCES TECHNICALLY CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE REVISED ATTACHMENT 1 - DRAFT-2 PWS PEO-STRI-15-W098 PDSS 2017-FEB2016 AND THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS BELOW:</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: PEO STRI has a requirement to provide PDSS for the fielded CCTT systems. This effort will consist of PDSS primarily for the CCTT and Dismounted Soldier Training Systems (DSTS).</p>
<p>CCTT is a collective training device composed of three systems (CCTT, RVTT and DSTS). CCTT collectively trains Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mechanized Infantry, and Armored Reconnaissance units from Squad through Battalion/Squadron level, to include their staffs in order to increase and sustain readiness. The primary training audience operates from immersive full-crew simulators, mock-up command posts, and live battalion command posts to train in combined arms maneuver and wide area security tactical missions, conduct mission rehearsal, and enhance live training.</p>
<p>PDSS FOR CCTT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING ALL ASPECTS OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE SUPPORT TO CCTT AND ITS PROJECTS/SUBSYSTEMS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS MAIN MISSION OF PROVIDING A VIRTUAL COLLECTIVE TRAINING CAPABILITY, AS WELL AS THE OBSOLESCENCE OF CCTT AND DSTS HARDWARE.</p>
<p>The system contains a mix of current and legacy custom built, COTS and GOTS applications from multiple vendors including other Government agencies. It will require complex configuration management, including development and test of multiple software baselines in tandem. It will require software and hardware installation and support for more than 500 simulators at over 40 sites both CONUS and OCONUS. It will require the maintenance and operation of a development lab with no less than eight highly complex manned modules to support the overarching PDSS requirements.</p>
<p>This effort will consist of PDSS Basic services including Program Management Office (PMO) oversight as well as engineering, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, logistics, and maintaining the various lab assets. This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, supporting Interoperability between training systems, maintaining Cybersecurity and Authority to Operate (ATO) and fielding approved changes to CCTT hardware and software baseline accomplished through PDSS.</p>
<p>This effort includes the integration and support of Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) development and LVC-IA products as directed by the Government. This effort includes the integration and development of OneSAF products and the integration of SE Core databases and moving models.</p>
<p>This effort includes various other efforts such as Subject Matter Expert (SME) consultation, Training Services, help desk support, and required contractor logistics support.</p>
<p>Contractors shall note that due to the nature of the data and software that is going to be dealt with for this effort, there will be distribution agreements addressing security/export compliance requirements that must be met, as such there will be an exclusion of Foreign Companies/Foreign Nationals. All personnel must have a secret clearance to work on the CCTT PDSS contract and development will be required in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>Contractor will develop and support software using non-proprietary components. All software is to be developed and modified to provide Government Purpose Rights. Any contractor presenting a proposal using proprietary components/software will not be considered for this effort. The software build environment must be self-contained, not dependent on any capital assets.</p>
<p>The information above does not preclude the use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software in your particular solution. However, the intent behind requiring GPR is to allow the Government to pursue future upgrades/modifications and Life Cycle Support in a competitive environment. Excessive use of COTS that contain restrictive rights or recurring licensing agreements does not support this intent and may be considered a weakness in contractor approaches should this effort progress to Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>Transition from the current PDSS contractor to the new contractor must not cause disruption to other ongoing efforts supported by PDSS.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO PROVIDE AN ASSUMABLE LEASE FOR THE CONTRACTOR'S FACILITY REQUIREMENTS AS DEFINED IN THE REVISED ATTACHMENT 1 - DRAFT-2 PWS PEO-STRI-15-W098 PDSS 2017 FEB2016.</p>
<p>At the Government's request, the contractor shall procure field equipment to support CCTT tech refresh or concurrency upgrades under this effort.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates future requirements may include the PDSS for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) database production capabilities and other PM ITE programs that require PDSS activities.</p>

This effort will consist of PDSS primarily for the CCTT and Dismounted Soldier Training Systems (DSTS). <br /><br />CCTT is a collective training device composed of three systems (CCTT, RVTT and DSTS). CCTT collectively trains Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mechanized Infantry, and Armored Reconnaissance units from Squad through Battalion/Squadron level, to include their staffs in order to increase and sustain readiness. The primary training audience operates from immersive full-crew simulators, mock-up command posts, and live battalion command posts to train in combined arms maneuver and wide area security tactical missions, conduct mission rehearsal, and enhance live training. <br /><br />PDSS for CCTT is responsible for providing all aspects of software support to CCTT and its projects/subsystems in order to maintain its main mission of providing a virtual collective training capability, as well as the obsolescence of CCTT and DSTS hardware. <br /><br />The system contains a mix of current and legacy custom built, COTS and GOTS applications from multiple vendors including other Government agencies. It will require complex configuration management, including development and test of multiple software baselines in tandem. It will require software and hardware installation and support for more than 500 simulators at over 40 sites both CONUS and OCONUS. It will require the maintenance and operation of a development lab with no less than eight highly complex manned modules to support the overarching PDSS requirements. <br /><br />This effort will consist of PDSS Basic services including Program Management Office (PMO) oversight as well as engineering, communication, technical assessment, studies, analyses, documentation, and programmatic support associated with concurrency, upgrades, enhancements, logistics, and maintaining the various lab assets. This effort also includes the activities associated with designing, testing, documenting, supporting Interoperability between training systems, maintaining Cybersecurity and Authority to Operate (ATO) and fielding approved changes to CCTT hardware and software baseline accomplished through PDSS. <br /><br />This effort includes the integration and support of Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) development and LVC-IA products as directed by the Government. This effort includes the integration and development of OneSAF products and the integration of SE Core databases and moving models. <br /><br />This effort includes various other efforts such as Subject Matter Expert (SME) consultation, Training Services, help desk support, and required contractor logistics support. <br /><br />Contractors shall note that due to the nature of the data and software that is going to be dealt with for this effort, there will be distribution agreements addressing security/export compliance requirements that must be met, as such there will be an exclusion of Foreign Companies/Foreign Nationals. All personnel must have a secret clearance to work on the CCTT PDSS contract and development will be required in a controlled environment. <br /><br />Contractor will develop and support software using non-proprietary components. All software is to be developed and modified to provide Government Purpose Rights. Any contractor presenting a proposal using proprietary components/software will not be considered for this effort. The software build environment must be self-contained, not dependent on any capital assets. <br /><br />The information above does not preclude the use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software in your particular solution. However, the intent behind requiring GPR is to allow the Government to pursue future upgrades/modifications and Life Cycle Support in a competitive environment. Excessive use of COTS that contain restrictive rights or recurring licensing agreements does not support this intent and may be considered a weakness in contractor approaches should this effort progress to Request for Proposals. <br /><br />Transition from the current PDSS contractor to the new contractor must not cause disruption to other ongoing efforts supported by PDSS. <br /><br />The CCTT PDSS must be located in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area and effort must be performed in the PEO STRI Orlando Research Park Area. This is required in order to have access to and connectivity with other PM ITE programs; and facilitate integration support with SE Core and LVC-IA. <br /><br />The facility must be able to support classified and unclassified work. <br /><br />The facility must provide high bay space, power, network access, etc. for the PDSS assets to include at least each configuration of manned modules that are fielded. <br /><br />QUANTITIES: Core PDSS tasks and technical services include: <br /><br />Program Management Office (PMO) <br />Hardware and Software Baseline Management <br />Fielding of new hardware and software baselines <br />Configuration Management of all software and the complete library of all design documentation, drawings, TDP, manuals, etc. <br />Cybersecurity design, implementation, patching, accreditation <br />Discrepancy Report management <br />User Support - help desk for site Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) crew both CONUS and OCONUS <br />Training Assistance Services for site CLS crews or local unit as requested by the Government <br />Support to LVC-IA integration and test <br />Support to SE Core integration and test <br />Support to OneSAF integration and test <br />Support to interoperability integration and test, with systems such as Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and Games for Training (GFT) <br />Obsolescence and technology insertion efforts <br />Operation and maintenance of PDSS assets <br /><br />ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS: <br /><br />The current CCTT PDSS Lab is approximately 21,850 square feet of which 9,966 square feet is allocated for lab space and 11,884 square feet is allocated for office space. The contractor shall provide a CCTT PDSS Lab facility that is equal to or larger than the current square footage. <br /><br />At the Government's request, the contractor shall procure field equipment to support CCTT tech refresh or concurrency upgrades under this effort. <br /><br />The Government anticipates future requirements may include the PDSS for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) database production capabilities and other PM ITE programs that require PDSS activities. <br /><br />INDUSTRY DAY: <br /><br />The Government anticipates holding an Industry Day event, details will be provided at a later date under this Opportunity Number, W900KK-15-R-0042. <br /><br />ACQUISITION APPROACH: The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the CCTT PDSS effort. The Government anticipates that the requirements will be fulfilled via task orders under a single source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-Off basis. <br /><br />Task orders will be issued from the single award IDIQ contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost and/or Time and Materials (T&amp;M) Contract Line Item Numbers for technical services. The Period of Performance will be for a one-year base period with four one-year options.

<DESC>1.  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Policy Â§ 3.2.1.2.1.  Interested parties are advised that: 
- This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals;
- The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals;
- The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses; and
- Any costs associated with your response are solely at the interested partiesâ€™ expense.   

2.  Description of the Required Services
Navigation Technical Assistance Contract
The Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of modernizing the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet the needs of the 21st Century.  Inherent in this mission is the requirement to provide a safe, cost-effective, navigation and timing service. Currently, navigation requirements are largely met with legacy, ground-based navigation, and lighting systems.  FAA has committed to evolving the NAS to Performance Based Navigation (PBN).  During this lengthy transition, FAA has a requirement to support both legacy and modernized navigation systems.  

Through the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), FAA is addressing the impact of air traffic growth by increasing capacity and efficiency while improving safety, reducing environmental impacts, and increasing user access to the National Airspace System (NAS).  PBN is an essential element of the NextGen plan to modernize the NAS.  To achieve NextGen goals, FAA is implementing new PBN routes and procedures that leverage emerging space-based technologies and enhanced aircraft navigation capabilities.  

The NAVTAC II support Contractor will assist the Navigation Programs Group and Performance Based Navigation Offices in their joint mission to provide safe, cost-effective position, navigation, and timing services to meet the operational needs of current and future aviation customers that operate in the NAS.   The FAA Navigation Programs Group and the PBN Office have a need for professional services covering areas such as engineering support, logistics, software integration and maintenance, training, operations research and analysis, requirements development and analysis, and business and material management. Examples include technical support services to assist in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, sustainment, and decommissioning of various navigation, landing, and lighting systems, as well as support for the PBN Instrument Flight Procedure (IFP) process. 

3.  The FAA intends to use FAA and contractor support staff in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement and will ensure that the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to any review.

4.  The Questions and Answers Part 2 in response to the second DRAFT SIR document have been uploaded for review.

5.  All SIR Sections below are currently in draft status and subject to revisions and final approval.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS ONLY

SOLICITATION NUMBER: N40085-16-R-3035

This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to make notice of a proposed contract action for a design-bid-build project to renovate the Main Exchange Building at Naval Station Newport, RI.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

This project will renovate the existing 2-story 66,800+/- SF Main Exchange Building at Naval Station Newport, RI. Project includes selective demolition, repair and renovation of the existing commercial retail and administrative areas; and a 1,600 SF addition which will expand and renovate a portion of the store in order to create a Package Store within the building footprint.
 The facility shall remain operational during the renovation. Phasing will be required.

Construction will provide a new monumental stair, walk-in beer cave, new check-outs and
Customer Service Area, audio visual display area, and add a new H/C accessible exterior entry ramp. Improvements will renovate the existing Retail sales areas, Barber Shop, and Food Court seating area and will relocate the existing Electronics Department, Conference Room, Employee Lounge, and Cash Office.

The â€œExpansionâ€ portion of this project will relocate the existing NEX Package Store and incorporate it into the footprint of the existing NEX Garden Shop. The Package Store will be a department within the main Exchange and not a standalone operation.
 One contiguous retail space for a new package store will be created by converting the partially covered outside areas of the Garden Shop and portion of an enclosed but unconditioned Garden Shop space into NEX interior space and removing existing exterior partitions separating the interior and exterior Garden Shop space. A new walk-in beverage cooler will also be installed at existing interior NEX space that is currently occupied by a smaller reach-in cooler and by NEX Sales floor space. A new automatic sliding entrance door and interior vestibule will be created as well. Existing exterior walls around the Garden Center will need to be demolished and rebuilt to comply with current UFC building envelope standards, and the existing building structure will be modified in order to allow the building addition to be structurally isolated from the reminder of the existing NEX building, to comply with ATFP Standard 7.

This solicitation is being advertised as an Unrestricted, Full and Open procurement.
  This is a source selection procurement requiring both non-price (technical) and price proposals.  In accordance with DFARS 236.204, the magnitude of construction for this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The appropriate Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 226220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the Small Business Size Standard is $36,500,000.

In accordance with DoD Instruction 4105.67 Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Procurement Policy and Procedure, Section 631 et seq. of Title 15, U.S.C., also known as â€œthe Small Business Actâ€, is not applicable to NAF procurements.  

The drawings and specifications for this project will be posted with the solicitation and are not available at this time.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 19 Oct 2016.
  ALL DOCUMENTS will be in the Adobe Acrobat PDF file format and downloadable from the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website.  The official address to the solicitation will be https://www.neco.navy.mil or www.fbo.gov.  A free Acrobat Reader, required to view the PDF files, can be downloaded from the Adobe website. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: All prospective offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (www.sam.gov) and the Online Representations ad Certifications Application (ORCA) database (https://orca.bpn.gov).  Contractors will be searched against the Excluded Parties List (EPL) to ensure they are eligible for Federal contract awards. 

Questions regarding this notice should be directed to Deanna Ward at deanna.ward@navy.mil.

<DESC>**5 October 2016 - Extended Pre-Solicitation Notice response due date to 11 Oct 2016.  ***********************************************************************  **29 September 2016 - Revised Pre-Solicitation Notice Questions and Answers posted to the SPAWAR E-Commerce website.  ***********************************************************************  **21 September 2016  Pre-Solicitation Notice Questions and Answers posted to the SPAWAR E-Commerce website.  ***********************************************************************  **16 September 2016 - Original Posting  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic, Charleston, SC is issuing this pre-solicitation notice to inform industry about an upcoming solicitation (N65236-16-R-0001) and to encourage interested parties to participate in the Advisory Multi-Step Process (FAR 15.202).  See below for details for responding to the Advisory Multi-Step requirement.  The proposed acquisition will be for the procurement of an Advanced Analytics Technical Solution (AATS).   The contractor shall deliver advanced analytics software to assist with the processing, exploitation, analysis, interpretation and presentation of all-source intelligence data and will include a robust, open application programming interface (API) that provides extensive support for integration of Government-developed and commercially-developed application plugins and integration to AATS data storage.  The software will minimize total ownership costs and will accommodate the characteristics of the user population that will operate, maintain, and support the software without on-site contractor support.  The contractor shall also provide support for implementation planning, software installation, software engineering, ontology installation, cybersecurity/information assurance, testing, training, and fielding of the AATS software product.  The Program Sponsor is Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM). To meet this AATS requirement, the Government is seeking a commercial item (CI) or non-developmental item (NDI) only.  There are no development funds planned or available for this effort including funding for the mitigation of future obsolescence issues. Classified work shall be performed under this contract and subsequent task orders, as required.  Certain PWS tasks require access to classified information up to the level of TOP SECRET with Sensitive Compartment Information (SCI).  No safeguarding of classified information at contractor facilities is required.  On 16 December 2015, SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic issued a sources sought notice (SSC- Atlantic_MKTSVY_112D4A) via the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) web site. Interested parties were encouraged to reply to the sources sought notice and were notified that the Government reserved the right to consider potential set- asides for small businesses.  Based on market research results, this procurement will be conducted using full and open competitive procedures. The Small Business Administration Procurement Center Representative has concurred with this decision.  The Government anticipates a single award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) supply and services contract with a five-year ordering period.  Delivery/task orders issued under this contract will be either Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) or Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF).  The applicable NAICS code is 511210 with a size standard of $38.5 Million. The requirement contains approximately 90% supplies and 10% services.  The primary place of performance will be Government facilities at SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic in Charleston, SC with required travel.  SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic is providing the anticipated contract line item number (CLIN) structure (solicitation section B) and the draft performance work statement (solicitation section C) along with this synopsis on the SPAWAR e-Commerce website for industry review and comment.  SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic is utilizing the Advisory Multi-Step Process (See FAR 15.202) in order to advise prospective offerors about their potential to be viable competitors and permit potential offerors to make informed decisions about whether to participate in this acquisition.  This pre-solicitation notice provides a general description of the scope of the acquisition.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to provide responses to this pre- solicitation notice, explaining their capabilities in the subject areas outlined below.  Please note that this is not a request for proposals.  Responses to this pre-solicitation synopsis are not offers and do not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions and Answers:</span></p>
<p>1. Why does the required instrument need a dual anode target? To maximize sensitivity for specific elements and concentrations and in which specific sample matrices? Utilizing various secondary targets will provide similar performance. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span> SSC will provide sensitivity specifications and not a method of achieving in the solicitation.</p>
<p>2. The MDL for Fe in oil states it must be 0.50 ppm. Is that for light oil (mineral oil) matrix or other? What kinds of oils will the system be needed to analyze? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span> SSC requires measuring the Iron levels in both Hydraulic Oil and Turbofan Engine Oil at levels of 1.00 PPM and below.</p>
<p>3. Why is a bandpass filter being required for analysis of elements K to Mn? To maximize sensitivity at what concentration levels and which specific sample matrices are you needing to analyze in normal every day application work? Once again, secondary targets will allow you to maximize sensitivity in various elemental ranges. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span> SSC will provide sensitivity specifications and not a method of achieving in the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>SBA 8(a) Approval #0885/16/607217/01:<br /><br />LOST TRAIL STREAM AND WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECT<br />The Lost Trail National Wildlife Refuge is located in the West Central portion of Flathead<br />County, Montana. Encompassing 9,225 acres, the Refuge was established as the 519th Refuge in the National Wildlife Refuge System managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).<br />Prior to establishment of the Refuge, lands were used primarily for cropland, livestock grazing, and agriculture. The historical land use practices significantly altered wetland and aquatic resources within the Refuge. Wetlands have been impacted by water impoundments, irrigation diversions, wetland drains, and infrastructure including the Great Northern Railroad and Pleasant Valley Road. Pleasant Valley Creek was straightened and channelized, lowering the groundwater table and resulting in loss of wetlands hydrology.<br />Construction work associated with this STREAM AND WETLAND RESTORATION<br />PROJECT will follow the plan drawings and specifications developed by River Design Group and approved by the NRCS and USFWS. The design is based on the USFWS Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) which presented the following recommendations: 1) restoration of native vegetation, 2) restoration of the natural wetland hydrology surrounding Dahl Lake and Pleasant Valley Creek, and 3) control of invasive plants.<br />Channel sinuosity and riffle/pool/run/glide sequences will be restored in a 5.7-mile reach of Pleasant Valley Creek. Historical floodplan surfaces will be re-connected to the stream by reducing the channel grade. Rock and woody structures will be incorporated into the channel to enhance channel stability and wildlife habitat. Approximately 47,000 lineal feet of drainage ditches, irrigation ditches, roadside ditches and abandoned stream channel will be earth-filled and seeded. These actions will result in a net increase of 222 acres of wetland habitat on the Refuge, mostly consisting of emergent and scrub-shrub wetland types. To support this project, approximately 3.0 miles of existing county road has been relocated under a separate Federal Highway Administration contract.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBPS) awarded a contract to Virtra Systems Inc. for maintenance and repair of VirTra 300 systems.<br /><br />The statutory authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is 41 U.S.C. 1901 as implemented by FAR 13.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items. CBP has previously procured 28 each model 300 training systems produced by Virtra Systems Inc. These systems allow participants to simulate the actions required in a deadly force encounter during training, in as realistic a way as possible, while still maintaining a safe environment. These systems included a one year warranty. These warranties are now, however, in the process of expiring. In order to keep these systems operational, preventative service and ongoing maintenance is required. Technical support is also a major requirement to ensure that users have direct troubleshooting issues that may arise during daily use. This contract vehicle will include cleaning and service of hardware and accessories, as well as maintenance and updates of VirTra's proprietary software. See attached J&amp;A for further information.<br /><br />A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. This notice is for information only. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals/quotations and no formal solicitation package is available. No award will be made on the basis of any proposal/quotation or other information received in response to this notice and this is a notification of intent to acquire supplies/services and not a request for proposals. <br />

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBPS) awarded a contract to Virtra Systems Inc. for supply of VirTra 300 systems.<br /><br />The statutory authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. CBP has previously procured model 300 training systems produced by Virtra Systems Inc. This action has filled an emergent need to provide improved and cost efficient use of force training for CBP law enforcement personnel with the immediate ability to create and reenact scenarios, and train responses to field level use of force reviews. The use of these systems has furthered CBP's mission. CBP desires to expand the use of the systems to new areas of operation. It is vital, however, that any new systems, and their related components/accessories be compatible with all aspects of the current VirTra systems. Specifically, this includes the VirTra Operating System (VOS), scenario development/display, and tetherless components/accessories. See attached J&amp;A for further information.

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
Medical Surgical Prime Vendor - Next Generation (MSPV-NG)
Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for Medical Equipment and Supplies
1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
				Office of Acquisition Operations
				Strategic Acquisition Center
				10300 Spotsylvania Avenue, Suite 400
				Fredericksburg, VA  22408

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for medical equipment and supplies, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6, "Limited Sources." The required items are supplied by Olympus America Inc., a Large Business, located at 3500 Corporate Parkway, Center Valley, PA 18034-0610.  These items will be procured via the VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-2065D to populate the MSPV-NG formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV-NG formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.  This LSJ will supply the MSPV-NG formulary with medical equipment and supplies distributed by Olympus America Inc. on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, they will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV-NG formulary in compliance with the FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements".

3.  Acquisition History:  VHA manages the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.  In 2013, the system consisted of 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks with approximately 150 medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, and various other facilities to include Community Living Centers, Veteran Centers and Domiciliaries.  Together, these health care facilities, and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them, provide comprehensive care to about 9.3 million enrolled Veterans.  The MSPV Program is the primary means to obtain medical and surgical supply support for the VA healthcare system through contract support.  VHA, in cooperation with VA's National Acquisition Center (NAC), initiated contract support for the MSPV program in 2005.  The result was the first generation of seven prime vendor distributor contracts that not only support VHA, but also support the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of State, Indian Health Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV-NG contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts' expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, the SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC's lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV-NG formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV-NG formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV-NG Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA's salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV-NG contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA's Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.  Supply-line categories were found to be the most favored by industry.  In an effort to validate this, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued to industry in February 2016.  The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV-NG distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin on October 20, 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor's e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA's strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date of April 20, 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV-NG formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV-NG formulary and estimated to be ready for use by October 20, 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified by VHA to be procured under this LSJ.  This group includes various types of medical equipment and supplies distributed by Olympus America Inc.   Examples of items covered under this category include various types of scopes, medical with accessories and replacement parts, includes but is not limited to duodenoscopes, endoscopes and surgical microscopes and equipment maintenance and repair.   Laboratory microscopes are excluded.  The full list of items covered under this LSJ is as follows:

The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV-NG contracts on a temporary basis, and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV-NG formulary items.  

The proposed types of medical equipment and supplies will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV-NG program.  VHA analyzed the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Medical Products Data Bank, focusing on the top high-volume purchases and identified types of critical medical equipment and supplies distributed by Olympus America Inc.  Until the MSPV-NG formulary is completed, VHA's ordering officers will be allowed to place orders for the required medical equipment and supplies.  The anticipated total value of the proposed BPA over the life of the agreement is $4,453,728.21.  The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), an urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)". Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in fewer errors when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those inefficient methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there is approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 formal contracting actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders via MSPV, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times to procure these items through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days; emergency orders require action within three days.  All orders would become emergencies to ensure timely delivery of healthcare to Veterans.  C canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would possibly become the norm, and thus, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to provide immediate care will be jeopardized, and will directly impact the safety and lives of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters, and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA or US Dept. of Health & Human Services for response to and recovery from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potential disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation. This would directly impact healthcare delivery to our nation's Veterans.

Other alternatives were considered, including using both the legacy bridge contracts, and the MSPV-NG contract concurrently until all of the required items can be competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable, as field staff will face the uncertainty of which contracts to use and when.   A well-coordinated supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ, and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable or timely alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation, and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule, and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system, and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans. Items procured under the authority of this LSJ will be included in the MSPV supply chain for a maximum period of twelve months until the item can be competitively awarded.  At such time the item will be removed from the supply chain and replaced with the competitively awarded functional equivalent.

This action is vital to support VA's nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV-NG program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV-NG would have catastrophic effects on the field's ability to support medical centers.  Each item would have to be purchased individually either via purchase card, or through local VHA Contracting Offices, with lead times of up to 45 days.  VHA Logistics and Contracting do not have the capacity to meet the constant throughput of high cost/high volume daily individual orders required to meet clinical care needs.  Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV-NG program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

a.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV-NG formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
b.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
c.	The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
d.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV-NG distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin on October 20, 2016.  The MSPV-NG distributors require VA's formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA's critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV-NG formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV-NG formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV-NG requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by October 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV-NG formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV-NG's period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV-NG distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders on approximately October 20, 2016, for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV-NG formulary.  SAC will work with VHA's program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV-NG BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable.
