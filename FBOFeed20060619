<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09. This solicitation is a total small business set-aside, NAICS 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, with a small business size standard of $6.5 million. The National Park Service encourages the participation of small, disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses. The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer represents the best value for the Government, price and other factors considered.  Prices must include all costs for all work as shown.  Statement of Work:  Title:  GATEWAY NATIONAL RECREATION AREA CATALOGING PROJECT  I. Project Summary of Work Work of this contract consists of arrangement, processing, re-housing, describing and cataloging into the Automated National Catalog System Plus (ANCS+) approximately 3,000 items of architectural drawings and maps related to Gateway National Recreation Area. This project will gain intellectual and physical control over three unprocessed collections that include architectural drawings and maps related to Gateway NRA.  Though this project has no active intervention (conservation) component, information gathered during the course of the project will be applied to future planning for digitizing, copying and preservation. Arrangement, re-housing, and description of these records will improve access and long-term preservation of these documentary resources of permanent value that are critical to daily management of park sites and programs.  Work shall be performed to National Park Service standards, professional archival standards, and Gateway NRA standards. The work will be divided into two phases: Phase I - Processing, Re-housing and Phase II - Cataloging.  II. Background History Gateway National Recreation Area was created in 1972.  Gateway was the first National Recreation Area in the country.  It was created in order to bring a national park closer to an urban area in order to serve a population that may not have been able to travel to more remote national parks.  Gateway NRA was created on primarily surplus military sites.  These areas have a long history of occupation.  While some of our maps predate military occupation, many of the park's architectural drawings and maps related to the structures and infrastructure the military created at these sites.  Gateway NRA has a large backlog of un-cataloged objects and a small staff that will not be able to catalog all the objects in this backlog.  In 1998 a PMIS project, # 20884 was written in order to process and catalog park architectural drawings and maps according to NPS standards. III. Location Archival materials in this project are currently housed in building 210 at Fort Wadsworth located in Staten Island.   The work will be conducted either on site or off-site at the contractor's secure facility. IV. Statement of Work   The work of this project will entail full processing, re-housing and cataloging to National Park Service standards as stated in Museum Handbook, Part II: Museum Records http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mushbkII.html), NPS ANCS+ Manual (http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/ancs.html), NPS Conserve-O-Grams (http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/cons_toc.html) and will consist of the following Phases: Phase I - Processing, Re-housing  The contractor will verify the number (approximately 3,000) of the identified collections.  The Contractor will then develop a Processing Plan in coordination with the Government.  Provide an acid-free copy of the survey in the accession and/or catalog folders.  Include a copy of the survey in the Project Completion Report generated in Phase II. Processing:  The Contractor will implement the physical arrangement of each collection according to unit, site, building, utility, etc within GATE.   Re-housing the collection:  In general, the Contractor will re-house the collection into acid-free folders.  If drawings are too large to fit into folders they will be carefully rolled around an acid free tube and covered with mylar or rolled into an acid free box designed to hold rolled paper.  1. Document conservation needs:  Evidence of infestation, mold, or mildew and all documents with apparent conservation needs will be documented in a "Conservation Needs" list which will be provided to the park as an appendix to the project's completion report. 2. Remove fasteners:  Staples, pins, paper clips, twin, rubber bands and other fasteners will be removed without causing damage to the materials (if possible).  When necessary to maintain connections between items found attached to each other by a paper clip or other such fastener, those items will be placed in a folder insert inside of the main folder.  Fasteners that cannot be removed without damaging documents will be noted in the "Conservation Needs" list. 3. Unfold folded documents:  All folded documents will be carefully unfolded.  Folded items that are too brittle will be left folded.  These items will be listed in the "Conservation Needs" list described above. 4. Re-house fragile items:  As instructed by NMSC and park staff, fragile items will be re-housed appropriately, such as encasing in Mylar, interleaving with acid-free paper or placing inside folder inserts.  5. Buffer highly acidic items:  Items of high acidic composition will be removed from close contact with other items by interleaving with acid-free paper.  Temporary acid-free paper markers will be added to folders found to contain acidic materials.  A list of folders containing highly acidic items will be created and included in the "Conservation Needs" list described above. 6. Remove objects:  Objects will be removed to separate storage. 7. Re-house oversize items:  Any oversize item removed from its original location will be replaced with an acid-free Archival Separation Sheet documenting a description of the item, the date of removal, the name of the person removing the item, and the new location of the item.  A copy of the separation sheet will be placed with the item in order to cross-reference the original location.  Footnotes in the Collection Listing section of the finding aid will cross-reference removed items. 8. Generate folder labels:  All folders will be labeled in a neat, consistent manner and following conventions already established at the park.  Folders will be labeled in pencil.  Folder labels will include the following data:  the catalog numbers of the items cataloged individually, the folder topic with inclusive dates of the materials in the file, the map case and drawer number. Phase II - Cataloging.  The Contractor will develop under this Phase II the catalog records in the Collection Management module of the Automated National Catalog System Plus (ANCS+).   Provide Accountability:  Provide accountability and automated access by creating a catalog record in the Collection Management module of ANCS+ for each object.  In addition, a list of artifacts needing conservation work will be provided. V. Government Responsibilities.  A. The Government will designate the groups of records to be processed. B.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA will host an Industry Day conference on 23 June 2006 at BAE Systems, Stafford Commerce Center One, 25 Center Street, Stafford, VA. to provide an overview of the Total Force Manpower Models Reengineering (TFMMR) Program.  The objective of this conference is to provide background information and to address preliminary comments and/or questions regarding the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Program anticipates releasing a Final RFP in 4thQ FY06 for Concept Refinement/Technology Development activities. Background: Currently, the legacy manpower applications, MCModels (developed in the 1970s), are considered mission essential and support multiple HQMC agencies.  MCModels is a collection of models that support divisions of the Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA) Department, Headquarters U. S. Marine Corps, in the core manpower planning processes.  TFMMR will replace/upgrade/integrate thirteen legacy manpower applications (models) and deliver models where none currently exist, which will integrate and streamline all aspects of the Active and Reserve component manpower processes and improve efficiencies.  TFMMR will leverage emerging technologies and support the Total Force Manpower processes by redesigning/developing appropriate information management, simulation, analysis, and forecasting tools to capture and process manpower information, making data visible to the appropriate Marine Corps decision makers.  The following models will be replaced/upgraded/integrated: •	Recruit Distribution Model (RDM) •	Enlisted Assignment Model (EAM) •	Enlisted Staffing Goal Model (ESGM) •	Officer Planning and Utility System (OPUS) •	Officer Staffing Goal Model (OSGM) •	Target Force Planning Model (TFPM) •	Marine Equity Model (MEM) •	Officer Mobilization Model (OMM) •	Reserve Staffing Model (RSM) •	Reserve Enlisted Planning System (REPS) •	End Strength Projection Model (ESPM) •	Enlisted Promotion System (EPS) •	Officer Assignment Model (OAM) The improved Program will incorporate high-level systems architecture that should maximize the use of COTS/GOTS hardware and software and already owned Marine Corps enterprise software licenses (e.g., Oracle, ReportNet) that will be designed to provide reliable, timely, and consistent data for the appropriate decision makers.  This improved configuration will yield immeasurable cost avoidances and bring current systems into an enterprise environment.   Conference: Attendance to this Industry Day is recommended for all vendors interested in the TFMMR Program.  Please refer to the MARCORSYSCOM vendor web page: http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/Vendor/News/TFITSIndustry.asp for additional information and updates on the TFMMR Industry Day and Program, including the Draft RFP, Draft Statement of Work (SOW), and other supporting documentation.

<DESC>TITLE:  ANALYSES OF THE NIOSH QUALITY OF WORK LIFE SURVEY

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DART, Cincinnati, Ohio has a requirement for data management, updated occupation/industry coding, data analysis, and preparation of dissemination materials from 2002 General Social Survey.  NIOSH intends to update the 2002 General Social Survey dataset by adding SOC 2000 occupation codes and 2002 NAICS industry codes and conduct statistical analyses of scores on quality of work life (QWL) survey questions according to the new occupation and industry codes. The vendor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined below.  The vendor may require travel or communications with CDC/NIOSH to obtain materials needed to complete one or more of the tasks.

TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:

The General Social Survey (GSS) dataset contains responses from 1,777 workers who answered questions about their occupation and industry and questions in the QWL module.  Because the 2000 SOC contains more occupation codes than the 1980 census occupation system, and because the 2002 NAICS system is very different than the 1980 census industry code system, it is necessary for the bidder to review each of the 1,777 GSS respondent records and assign the correct occupation and industry code as a supplement to the existing 1980 occupation and industry codes.  Once the new occupation and industry codes have been assigned, the bidder shall group each set of codes into two-digit groups/categories and conduct statistical analyses of the QWL survey items according to occupation and industry groupings.

The vendor shall perform the following tasks:

A.  Using supplemental information to be supplied by NIOSH, perform a record by record analysis and assign a detailed SOC 2000 occupation code for each of the 1,777 respondents in the dataset. The 2000 SOC codes can be obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/soc/).   Identify any discrepancies between the existing 1980 Census occupation code and the 2000 SOC codes (i.e., cases where the old and new occupation codes differed significantly) and devise procedures for resolving discrepancies.  Cross check each code for accuracy and provide a listing of all translated codes.  Submit plan for resolving discrepancies to Project Officer for approval. 

B. Using supplemental information to be supplied by NIOSH, perform a record by record analysis and assign a detailed NAICS 2002 industry for each of the 1,777 respondents.  NAICS codes can be obtained from the Bureau of Census (http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html).  Identify any discrepancies between the existing 1980 Census industry code and new NAICS codes (i.e., cases where the old and new industry codes differ significantly) and devise procedures for resolving discrepancies.  Cross check each code for accuracy and provide a listing of all translated codes.  Submit plan for resolving discrepancies to Project Officer for approval. 

C.  Add the converted and verified 2000 SOC and 2002 NAICS codes to the 2002 GSS dataset.  The 2002 GSS dataset can be obtained from the National Opinion Research Center (http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/).  The new occupation and industry codes should be added to each observation in the dataset and new variables names for 2000 SOC and 2002 NAICS codes should be assigned.  The final dataset should include the original Census occupation and industry codes as well as the new SOC and NAICS codes.

D.  Merge the 2002 QWL dataset with the older 1969, 1972 and 1977 QES datasets and create common variable names for each of the 38 QES items which were also contained in the QWL dataset (to be supplied by NIOSH Project Officer).  Although occupation and industry were coded differently in the QES surveys, the bidder shall aggregate occupation and industry codes to form categories/groups that resemble the two-digit groupings in the 2000 SOC and 2002 NAICS, respectively.  The bidder shall create groupings/categories of occupation and industry codes for each of the QES datasets which roughly match those of the SOC and NAICS groupings (see http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_stru.htm#00-0000#00-0000 for two-digit occupation groupings and http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nora/sector.html for two-digit industry groupings).  Provide details on how well the two sets of groupings agree and advice on the extent to which the groupings could be used to compare survey scores among the QES and QWL surveys.  The 2000 SOC contains twenty-two (22) two-digit occupational groups and the 2002 NAICS has twenty (20) two-digit industry groupings.

E. Analyze the merged dataset and compute simple frequencies and average (mean) scores for all QWL survey items grouped by two-digit occupation code (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_stru.htm#00-0000#00-0000).  Compute cross-tabulation frequencies of the two-digit occupation codes for the following eleven (11) QWL survey items: Self-rated health, Days of poor physical health in the past 30 days, days of poor mental health in the past 30 days, Summation of days of poor mental health and days of poor physical health in the past 30 days, Days of activity limitation in the past 30 days, Felt used up, Back pain, Pain in the arms, Number of injuries on the job, Job satisfaction, and Job stress.  Compute adjusted mean scores on all QWL survey items, adjusting for each of the demographic variables separately (i.e., age, race, gender, education) and adjusting for all demographic variables together according to the two-digit grouped 2000 SOC occupation codes (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_stru.htm#00-0000#00-0000).  Each of the analyses described above should be done twice for each survey item; once using the sampling weights and once using unweighted raw scores. 

F.  Analyze the merged dataset and compute simple frequencies and average (mean) scores for each two-digit sector industry group (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nora/sector.html) for all 76 QWL survey items.  Compute cross-tabulation frequencies for two-digit sector industry groups for the following eleven (11) QWL survey items: Self-rated health, Days of poor physical health in the past 30 days, days of poor mental health in the past 30 days, Summation of days of poor mental health and days of poor physical health in the past 30 days, Days of activity limitation in the past 30 days, Felt used up, Back pain, Pain in the arms, Number of injuries on the job, Job satisfaction, and Job stress.  Compute adjusted mean scores on all QWL survey items, adjusting for each of the demographic variables separately (i.e., age, race, gender, education) and adjusting all demographic variables together according to 2-digit grouped 2002 NAICS sector codes (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nora/sector.html). Each of the analyses described above should be done twice for each survey item; once using the sampling weights and once using unweighted raw scores.

G.  Prepare tables and charts in Excel format, suitable for display on the NIOSH website, showing occupation and industry grouping scores on each of the 11 QWL items listed above.

H.  Submit final report containing the revised GSS 2002 dataset to NIOSH, the output of data analyses and tables in Excel format within 180 days of the date of this award.  The report should include a detailed description of the procedures used in assigning updated occupation and industry codes and the criteria used for resolving any coding discrepancies.  The final report also should 1) describe occupation and industry differences in worker health status and worker perceptions of job conditions based on scores on QWL items, 2) compare the 2002 QWL results with those from the prior QES surveys done in 1969, 1972, and 1977 and offer narrative text explaining significant differences in occupation and industry scores across the four (4) survey datasets.  Explanations of occupation and industry differences should acknowledge at minimum the changes that have taken place in both workforce demographics since 1969 and the changing nature of work itself (e.g., moving from a manufacturing to a service economy).

<SUBJECT>10--Performanced Based Logistics for support of US Navy Heavyweight and Lightweight Torpedeos
<SOLNBR>N0010406QL002
<CONTACT>Eric W. Kreider 717 605-2864
<DESC>This synopsis describes the proposed five-year acquisition of a full Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Program for the support of Heavyweight (HWT) and Lightweight (LWT) Torpedoes found in the U.S. Navy arsenal and other Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers with or without Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Agreements (CLSSA).   Additionally the PBL may cover support for the MK48 Mod 7 CBASS Heavyweight Torpedoes found in the Royal Australian Navy inventory.  The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) in Mechanicsburg PA is the contracting agency for the proposed contract.  NAVICP intends to use an Alpha negotiation process to streamline the acquisition process for the contract. The PBL will cover approximately 2,457 depot level repairable (DLR) and consumable items used to maintain the torpedoes. No option periods apply.  It is anticipated that this requirement will be placed on the NAVICP corporate contract with Raytheon.  The PBL will be awarded via contract mod!  ification or delivery order under the corporate contract citing the unique, essential requirements applicable to the torpedo weapon systems.  Under the PBL, Raytheon will function as the Navy’s Commercial Stock Point for the covered items including the performance of inventory management functions including, but not limited to, forecasting, procuring, receiving, shipping, tracking, warehousing, reporting and scheduling. Raytheon will be responsible for supplying material and DLR repair for various Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMA) to support the IMA’s mission of providing ready for use exercise and warshot HWT and LWT torpedoes to the fleet users.    Raytheon’s final proposal will be determined fair and reasonable by the contracting officer and must demonstrate a savings compared to Navy support costs as determined by an independent cost benefit analysis.  The NAVICP will issue an RFQ (N00104-06-Q-L002) for this requirement once the Government’s requirements are fin!  alized and all pre-solicitation requirements are satisfied.  Note 22 a pplies to this acquisition.

<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison (301)227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Code 74 currently operates three fixed location radar cross-section (RCS) measurement systems in which the Orbit AL-4015-SYS Antenna Positioner Systems are integrated subcomponents. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to ORBIT COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INCORPORATED (OCSI) for the purchase of an additional Orbit AL-4015-SYS to be used for maintenance and repair of existing units. OCSI is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and distributor. The Orbit AL-4015-SYS Antenna Positioner Systems are integrated subcomponents to these RCS measurement systems, which were designed with mechanical and electrical interfaces specific to the Orbit AL-4015-SYS and use of other than exact replacement units would require costly redesign of the RCS measurement systems, and would additionally create incompatibility problems between the three RCS systems in service. Award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost and efforts to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 7/04/2006.

Each project contract will be a firm fixed price A-E Contract.  The Government will determine the task order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract term will be a base year and four one-year option years.  The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional four years.  The annual fee for any year may not exceed $250,000.00 and per project limitation is $100,000.00.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $1,250,000.00.

Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper. For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE RFI.     THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES TO THIS RFI. The USAF Electronic Systems Center 642nd Electronic Systems Squadron (642d ELSS, formerly the Force Protection System Squadron) at Hanscom Air Force Base is supporting the Security Equipment Integration Working Group (SEIWG), which is a standing subcommittee of the Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG).  The PSEAG is the central manager for Physical Security Equipment (PSE) Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding within DOD.  SEIWG membership includes the US Air Force (USAF), US Army (USARMY), US Navy (USNAVY), and the US Marine Corps (USMC). Its mission is to coordinate and influence system architecture, technical design, and systems integration of all PSE to be used within the Department of Defense.  One of SEIWG's efforts is the development of a common Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) Technical Standard Forecast (TV-2) to be used by the four services for information related to future acquisition of PSE. This is an integral part of the process of developing a joint PSE technical architecture for application to all DOD PSE design and acquisition efforts. The USAF through the 642nd Electronic Systems Squadron (642d ELSS) is serving SEIWG as the Lead DoD organization in standardizing device interfaces for the SEIWG. To ensure that the industry is aware of our efforts in developing a common list of emerging standards to be used for future acquisition of physical security equipment, and to ensure that the maximum number of vendor's equipment can be accommodated in our security solutions, we are soliciting comments on this draft of the technical standards forecast.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 813312   This is a sources sought notice for written information only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. In preparation for an upcoming procurement under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) is conducting market research for a guide outlining local and city  best practices in reducing air emissions, including ozone and particle pollution.  The best practices guide will describe projects that reduce ozone and particle pollution emissions and protect human health and the environment. EPA will finalize the PM2.5 (particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers  or smaller in size) implementation rule later in 2006.  The state implementation plans (SIP plans), where states show how non-attainment areas will meet the PM2.5 standards by 2010, will then be due by April 2008.  Additionally, many counties in the country are designated in non-attainment for  ozone.  The timing of the debut of the best practices guide will assist designated counties to improve air quality issues, as well as serve as successful models for counties that are on the border of non-attainment. The best practices guide will be a comprehensive list of existing, successful  actions that non-attainment areas can draw upon in order to meet these standards.  Under the proposed purchase order, the Contractor will compile and design a guide that will provide information on measures local entities and governments can take to successfully reduce their ground-level ozone  (smog) and particle pollution concentrations. The Contractor will also provide a written outreach and marketing plan for the best practices guide, which will be used in disseminating the guide to the appropriate market audiences. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for  this procurement is 813312, with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $6.5 million. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.

<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice replaces the notice posted on April 4, 2006, for PLACE.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a five (5) year, $300 million, multiple award, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC). There will be approximately three (3) unrestricted and two (2) small business set-aside awards. However the number of awards will be based upon the best value determination of the Contracting Officer. The anticipated small business subcontracting percentage will be 40% of the contract ceiling. Of that percentage, a 15% requirement will be allocated to Small Disadvantaged Business participation. Perspective offerors are encouraged to use the following Small Business Administration (SBA) website to identify potential small businesses in support of the requirements set forth above: http://web.sba.gov/subnet/ The Prosperity, Livelihoods and Conserving Ecosystems (PLACE) IQC will support the Natural Resources Management Office’s (EGAT/NRM) Strategic Objective (SO) “Increased social, economic and environmental benefits through healthy ecosystems and sustainable resource management”. The Intermediate Results (IRs) associated with this SO include: IR1: Improving management and conservation across diverse landscapes through science, interdisciplinary approaches and the adoption of best practices; IR2: Promoting equitable natural resources governance and management of natural resource conflicts; IR3: Increasing economic opportunities through sustainable production, marketing and trade of natural resource-based products and services; and IR4: Strengthening USAID operating units and partners through field support, technical leadership and knowledge management. The awardee(s) will be expected to respond rapidly to requests from USAID Missions and Bureaus for technical assistance in carrying out integrated approaches to managing the biophysical, social, governance and economic components of natural resources management and biodiversity conservation. Activities may include interventions at multiple spatial scales from the household to issues of global dimension. The awardee(s) shall furnish personnel having substantial experience and expertise, both practical and conceptual, to perform the range of activities described by this Statement of Work, and as further delineated in subsequent Task Orders. Awardee(s) will be expected to respond in a comprehensive and technically sound manner to Performance-Based Task Orders from all USAID clients. This form of Task Order describes and quantifies the results expected and provides target levels or standards of performance, but is not prescriptive in detailing the means to reach desired outcomes. The technical assistance provided by the awardee(s) will address a wide range of topics relating to varied aspects of natural resources management. USAID anticipates that some commodity procurement, equipment installation, and/or the making of small grants to host-country organizations will be called for under various Task Orders. The awardee(s) will be expected to work primarily with host country government institutions (national, provincial, and local) charged with management and decision-making responsibilities in biodiversity conservation and natural resources management and/or local NGOs, private sector entities, academic/research institutions and community/civil society organizations that are stakeholders in sound resource management and conservation. This mechanism will replace and build on the BIOFOR IQC in providing USAID Missions/Offices and their partners with a broad range of technical assistance components in order to address complex development needs across multi-use landscapes. These components can be divided into three categories: 1) overarching themes; 2) Primary Natural Resource Management Categories; and 3) Cross-Cutting Resource Management Approaches. Overarching Themes 1. Integrated Landscape/Seascape Management 2. Scaling-up & Sustaining Impact 3. Supporting Fragile and Transformational States Primary Natural Resource Management Categories 1. Biodiversity Conservation (terrestrial, fresh-water and marine) 2. Sustainable Forestry 3. Sustainable Tourism 4. Sustainable Agriculture 5. Provision of Ecosystem Services Cross-cutting Natural Resource Management Approaches 1. Governance and Policy Reform 2. Property & Resource Rights 3. Institutional Strengthening & Capacity Building 4. Enterprise Development 5. Sustainable Finance 6. Conflict Mitigation & Management 7. Gender and strengthening the role of women and disadvantaged groups 8. Small Grants Management

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Richard Wheelwright, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3941
<DESC>The Government intends to award a contract to Radical Systems, Inc. on a sole source basis for the following: Current military operations in Iraq have drastically increased the Armyâ€™s  effort to support and repair weapons system elements returning from the Unit of  Action. The workloads at depot repair facilities has grown exponentially, and  requires depot personnel to repair, reset, calibrate and verify a greater  number of line replaceable units (LRUâ€™s) in a shorter period of time. Anniston  Army Depot has the primary mission for repairing Main Battle Tank (M1/M1A1)  LRUâ€™s (specifically the Gunners Primary Site Azimuth Drive) and refielding them  within a newly compressed schedule.  Current support equipment used in this activity and located at Anniston is not  sufficient to meet this new Army need for rapid repair. The equipment was  developed more than twenty years ago, uses antiquated and unsupported  technologies and has serious obsolescence issues. Replacement parts are  difficult to find if available and any system down time at this point would  severely impact the Anniston mission.  In order to support these expanded support requirements, the current test stand  must be upgraded and modified to take advantage of state-of-the-art  technologies and tools while preserving current system functionally and  procedures. The system must also conform to the Anniston test environment  requirements, be seamlessly integrated in their current support structure,  interface with there data acquisition software and hardware and have local  support available. The Government has determined that there is only one contractor who can meet  all the requirements of this effort in a timely and cost effective manner.    Numbered note:  22, 26 apply.  P.O.C.

<DESC>THE NATURE OF THIS CONTRACTUAL ACTION WILL BE A NEW INDEFINITE-DELIVERY, REQUIREMENTS TYPE CONTRACT.  THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSED ACTION IS TO AWARD A NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT WITH A COST PLUS FIXED FEE PRICING ARRANGEMENT.

THESE SERVICES ARE TO BE ACQUIRED FROM CAS, INCORPORATED.  THE ATIRCM/CMWS IS THE CORE SYSTEM OF THE ARMY?S MODULAR SUITE OF INTEGRATED INFRARED COUNTERMEASURES (SIIRCM) DEVELOPMENTS AND CONTAINS TH!  E FUNCTIONS OF MISSILE DETECTION AND WARNING, INFRARED JAMMING, AND COUNTERMEASURE MUNITIONS DISPENSING.  THE CMWS WILL UTILIZE A SUBSET OF THE ATIRCM PROCESSOR MODULES/COMPONENTS.  ATIRCM/CMWS IS CURRENTLY THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY ELECTRONIC WARFARE PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) AND REQUIRES CONTINUOUS SUPPORT OF A WIDE RANGE OF CAPABILITIES AND SKILLS TO PRODUCE AN EFFECTIVE, SUPPORTABLE SYSTEM WITHIN THE REQUIRED MILESTONES AND CHALLENGING SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES.  IT IS REQUIRED THAT ALL SUPPORT SERVICES BE PROVIDED ON AN UNINTERRUPTED BASIS.  ANY INTERRUPTION WOULD SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZE THE TIME FRAMES FOR MEETING PROGRAM MILESTONES, WHICH WOULD CAUSE A DELAY IN DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINMENT CYCLE.  THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE THREE (3) YEARS WITH TWO (2) OPTIONAL ONE (1) YEAR ORDERING PERIODS.  CAS, INC. IS THE ONLY CONTRACTOR THAT HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATIRCM/CMWS SYSTEM AND IS THE ONLY CONTRACTOR WITH THE EXPER!  TISE AND KNOWLEDGE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPORT SERVIC ES WITHIN THE PROGRAM MILESTONE TIME FRAME WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.  CAS, INC.

HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, MAINTENANCE, AND OPERATION OF THE PRIMARY INFRARED COUNTERMEASURE (IRCM) ANALYSIS TOOL, THE E2E SIMULATION.  THE E2E CONTAINS OVER 2.5 MILLION LINES OF CODE, OF WHICH CAS, INC. HAS DEVELOPED OVER 60%.  FOR THE PAST TWELVE (12) YEARS CAS, INC. HAS PROVIDED PROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT FOR THE ATIRCM/CMWS PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE TRANSITION OF THE MISSILE WARNING AND DECOY PORTIONS OF ADVANCED INTEGRATED INFRARED COUNTERMEASURES MUNITIONS (AIRCMM) INTO THE PROGRAM.  THE PROCESSES AND EXPERIENCE GAINED IN DEVELOPING THE EXISTING PROGRAM DOCUMENTS AND DATABASES ARE INVALUABLE AS CMWS TRANSITIONS TO AN LOW RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION (LRIP) DECISION.  TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW SUCCESS ORIENTED PROGRAM!   MILESTONE SCHEDULE, CAS, INC. MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE UNINTERRUPTED SUPPORT OF THE SIMULATIONS AND ANALYSIS NEEDS OF ATIRCM/CMWS AND CONTINUE ESSENTIAL INTERFACES WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES MAY SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH SHALL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY.

The Contractor shall provide all items necessary to perform the services described herein, which shall include but are not limited to: office facilities, supplies, equipment, hardware, software, and professional expertise, travel expenses, etc.

The period of performance will be October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007.  The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government.  This acquisition is not set-aside for small business.

<DESC>The General Services Administration has identified a requirement for experienced consulting firms or teams to provide professional real estate support and relocation and acquisition services within the geographic area of the New England region.  The period of performance will be a base year with four, one-year option periods.  This procurement is identified as a small business set-aside. It is anticipated that three to five separate contracts may be awarded from this solicitation.  Successful firms will be awarded a firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ).   

The major requirement for this contract is to secure and expand approximately twenty-six (26) Northern Border Crossing Stations which are to be upgraded to accommodate current U.S. Security Requirements. It is anticipated that at each port of entry, 3-10 privately owned properties will need to be acquired for National Security purposes. It is estimated that each fiscal year, five border crossings will be impacted; therefore, the work load could range from 6 to 50 parcels annually for the next five years.

Joint venture arrangements will be considered and evaluated for demonstrated ability to provide a quality relocation and acquisition effort.  Respondents must demonstrate capability and a planned approach to perform all real estate contract services within the designated geographical area of consideration.  Supplemental information, such as representative examples of prior relevant projects is encouraged.  The minimum guarantee for each contract is $500.00. The total cumulative fee is a maximum of $100,000.00 for each one year period.  A separate fee will be negotiated for each separate task order. The fee will be based on the overhead, profit, and employee wage rates established in the contract. 
Services as prescribed for each separate project will be firm fixed price. Successful firms will be selected using a best value approach with technical criteria being approximately equal in importance to cost/price. Selection will be based on the following evaluation criteria in relative order of importance: (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (2) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.

This will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source selection procedures are identified in FAR Part 15.3, and will incorporate the tradeoff process identified in FAR 15.101-1. This method will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, including the past performance of their subcontractors, qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals. All proposals are required to address each of the qualifications. Omission of any of the criteria may render the proposal nonresponsive, preventing the opportunity to submit a price proposal and gain further consideration for award.  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors will be considered equal to cost. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are as follows: 1) Past Performance and Experience on Similar Projects.  Identification of projects, size, location, references, previous client assessment of offeror's performance, address project completion time and budget history. Offerors should provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.  Regarding past performance, offerors with no relevant performance history shall provide information, which helps to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the requirement. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. 
2) Proposed Project Team, Key Subcontractors, and Key Personnel.

Complete information on personnel including project supervisor’s resume(s) for day-to-day operations (installation) and for maintenance oversight are required. 3) Proposed Project Scheduling and Phasing of Construction. Offeror shall review the phasing plan identified in the solicitation. Phasing has been identified in four phases to minimize impact on building operations and is time critical to completion period identified.  4) Subcontracting Plan: Public Law 95-507 requires large businesses to provide a subcontracting plan setting forth percentage goals for utilizing small business concerns including, separately identified goals for disadvantaged small business and women-owned small business.  In addition, the prime contractor must describe the efforts it will take to assure that such firms have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts.  Offeror shall address how it will comply with the requirements of FAR 19.704.

<DESC>ABSTRACT: Office Equipment Screening Information Request (SIR) Strategic Sourcing Initiative for the procurement of Office Equipment (Nationwide, Alaska, Hawaii & Territories).  Office Equipment under this procurement will primarily consist of Multifunction Devices, Printers, accessories, and maintenance and lease agreements.  The FAA intends to contract with a commercial office equipment company that is on the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 36 for multifunctional devices (MFDs) and GSA Schedule 70 for printers. Offerors may submit a proposal for either equipment category (MFDs and Printers) or a combined proposal for both.   Requirements for both Office Equipment segments will include shipping and delivery to over 850 facilities located in the 48 contiguous states (includes the strict of Columbia), Alaska, Hawaii, and various U.S. territories in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Pacific (Guam, American Samoa, and Wake Island). The FAA anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm-fixed pricing per line item for the base year and four (4) one-year options.  Currently the estimated annual total of purchases for both Multifunction devices and printers is approximately $8M. This source selection is conducted in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is judged to represent the best value to the Government. The FAA reserves the right to award one contract, multiple contracts, or one contract for MFDs and one contract for printers, whichever is in the best interest of the FAA.  The Government reserves the right not to award a contract, depending on the quality of the proposals submitted and the availability of funds.  All interested sources should first download the Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Proposal (RFP) from this site.  All responses to this SIR/request for offer should be submitted electronically per the instructions in the SIR Section L.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.   The DOD’s DMSMS Knowledge Sharing Portal (DKSP) is soliciting expressions of interest from U.S. industry regarding the availability of a web-based predictive tool to be used in the process of obsolescence management by the DOD community consisting of organic / industrial service providers, Program Offices, and Program Executive Offices.  The tool will be accessed via a secure connection to the DKSP web site, www.dmsms.org and may be required to resident at the DKSP host site.  Further information about the DKSP’s structure, services, and operations may be obtained at the DKSP web site.  The DKSP is chartered to implement best practices for monitoring, tracking, resolving, and performing analytical logistic and engineering analysis related to obsolescence impacts.  The tool must monitor active electronic components, both commercial and military quality levels, used collectively in analog and digital circuit designs.  Interested parties that have or are developing capability f!  or monitoring passive and/or mechanical devices are encouraged to provide information on those capabilities including a timeline for introduction  (if not already available).  The DKSP endeavors to provide the DMSMS community with a tool offering the broadest set of recognized part numbers.  The users will load the tool with Bills of Materials (BOMs) in a manner that provides the greatest ease, flexibility, and utility to the user, while ensuring data security and integrity.  BOMs may be indentured or flat files and require linkage to identify commonality.  DKSP is interested in providing maximum forecasting accuracy and using the latest techniques in data mining or partnering to achieve such status.  Please address how you pursue continuous improvement in your forecasting abilities.  Tool providers should discuss the underlying modeling and assumptions of the tool in sufficient detail to validate the tools results.  Additionally, tool providers should describe what interfa!  ce screen customization capability is available at the user level; rep orting capability and customization; how discontinuance and product change notice alerts are provided; part cross referencing functionality; form, fit, function replacement part recommendations;  call out for errant part numbers and mitigation; device specific life cycle projection; the degree of granularity in part quality ratings that are provided; number of years historical part data is available; aftermarket source identification, forecasting, and update intervals;  how the tool identifies/quantifies obsolescence risk status; and how RoHS compliance is indicated.   Also please describe any hardware requirements, technical support provided, user requested part research capability, and demonstration capability.  Rough order of magnitude pricing of the basic and optional services is desired with your submittal but not required with this request for information.

<CONTACT>James Kelley (215) 897-7241
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY U.S. NAVY FLOW METER The US Navy is currently conducting a market survey in order to identify possible sources for the retrofit/replacement of a flow meter.  The flow meter measures HVAC chilled water flow in piping onboard most US Navy vessels.  The replacement flow meter must be capable of conforming to MIL-S-901 (shock requirements), MIL-STD-167 (vibration requirements), and MIL-STD-461 (EMI requirements).  The ideal flow meter should be able to operate on 28 volt DC power and must have an output of 4-20 mA, proportional to applicable flow ranges including the following approximations: 0 to 1000 gallons per minute for 5 inch diameter (NPS) pipe, 0 to 1800 gallons per minute for 6 inch diameter (NPS) pipe, 0 to 3250 gallons per minute for 8 inch diameter (NPS) pipe, and 0 to 4000 gallons per minute for 12 inch diameter (NPS) pipe.  Although standardization is preferred, the Navy will consider using a different type of flow meter for certain applications if necessary.  The accuracy of the flow !  meter must be + or – 5% of full range or better as installed.  The flow meter accuracy should not be significantly degraded by lack of long lengths of straight pipe before and after the meter.  The flow meter must be able to operate in a variety of mounting positions. Ease of installation, calibration, maintenance, and repair are factors that will be considered in the selection process.  If needed a more detailed description of the requirements of the Navy can be provided.  US and foreign firms interested in being considered should submit, in writing, a description of their product and technical specifications which fulfill the Navy’s requirements, or how it can be easily modified to meet these requirements, along with an estimated price and availability.  This announcement is a request for information only and is not a request for proposal or announcement of solicitation.  Firms which fail to respond may not be placed on the bidding list for possible future solicitation.  !  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to t his synopsis nor return any of the data provided.  All responding firms will be contacted and may be requested to exchange information with Navy personnel.  Replies should be sent to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, 5001 S.

Length/Width/Height requirements are approximately 9” by 12” by 6”, to allow it to be temporarily attached on top of an existing control panel.  The datalogger unit must be capable of recording information and operating with no battery changes for approximately six months.  The device should be easily adaptable to connect to a personal computer in order to retrieve the stored information and present it in a spreadsheet format.  The data logger must be capable of attaching to the existing control panel’s EIA-STD-485 port connection.  The datalogger unit must be able to be located 20” from the existing EIA-STD-485 port.  The device will need to be tail!  ored to the control panel’s unique data format (interface document available).

<DESC>NOTICE:  This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION(RFI).  It is not a solicitation, not an announcement of a solicitation, and not a notice of intent to later issue a solicitation.  Do not attempt to request or register to receive a solicitation at this time as that is not the purpose of this announcement.  No vendor(s) will be selected for a contract award based on their response to this RFI, it is for market research and procurement planning purposes only.

DESCRIPTION:  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Infrastructure Protection (OIP), Risk Management Division (RMD) provides the following information for the purpose of conducting market research regarding sources capable of developing and implementing an automated analytic tool to evaluate Gross Consequences of Attack (GCOA) on single or multiple sites of interest.  The information contained herein as well as the anticipated industry responses are for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

Over the course of conducting the GCOA analysis for the National Asset Database (NADB), the current tool developer, using feedback from DHS, identified specific issues that would enhance the GCOA results to more specifically meet DHS emergency management, policy, and operational decision-making objectives for these analyses.  Responses to this announcement are sought to identify industry sources that have the capability to provide analytical methods to access and manipulate data from the population software package.  The tool set requires adaptability to solve problems found through trend analysis and historical findings.  It must employ an open architecture in order to be capable of incorporating changing Information Technology (IT).  It must also be flexible enough to evolve in response to changes in DHS analytic methodologies and requirements.  A draft Statement of Work for the requirement is attached.

DHS is considering fulfilling this requirement by competing a task order under Federal Supply Schedule 871, Professional Engineering Services, using the procedures prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.4, but may change this acquisition strategy based upon the results of market research.

Potential sources are requested to submit the following information:

1. A description of their capabilities and experience relative to fulfillment of the requirement.  The description shall demonstrate the potential source’s ability both to develop the GCOA tool and to employ its analytic capabilities.
2. A description of their ability to support classified (SECRET) operations to include secure computing; secure voice facsimile communications; SECRET storage, maintenance of a SIPRNET terminal, and other classified systems as necessary.
3. Identification of any Federal Supply Schedule contracts held by the potential source, including Federal Supply Schedule 871.
4. A list of relevant contracts, either on-going or completed not more than 5 years ago, that demonstrate past performance relevant to the requirement.  Include period of performance, dollar amount, and issuing organization.

Responses shall be limited to 15 pages and shall be submitted by e-mail to christopher.wallis@dhs.gov by July 7, 2006.  Graphical content should be minimized to avoid exceeding bandwidth limitations.

There will be Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) restrictions associated with any resulting procurement to assure that the contractor’s scientific objectivity and judgment are not biased.

Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

<DESC>Market Survey Subject:  Market Survey for additional System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) software and hardware efforts for the Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) / Blue Force Tracking (BFT) system. Description of Requirement: The Program Manager (PM) FBCB2/BFT is conducting a market survey for sources for additional System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) efforts. The FBCB2/BFT system is specifically oriented to provide individual tactical vehicles  and platforms with Situational Awareness and Command and Control (C2).  The Government plans to support this effort by executing a ceiling increase to the current SE&I Contract (W15P7T-04-D-G205) with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS), to be accompl ished within the existing period of contract performance ending September 2009. This additional effort will be a continuation of current efforts being performed by NGMS.  NGMS has total system responsibility as integrator, engineer, and architect of the FB CB2 program. This increased effort builds on the ongoing FBCB2 software development performed under Contract W15P7T-04-D-G205.    The estimated value of this additional SE&I effort under Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract W15P7T-04-D-G 205 is $260M.       The contractor assumes Total System Responsibility (TSR), to ensure that software and hardware are integrated and supported through the life of the program.  Prototype hardware as required may be developed under this effort.  The government requires the SE&I contractor to be responsible for software development,  development and testing of  computer prototype hardware, and all integration tasks required to field this system.  FBCB2 software and hardware, communicating via the Tactical Internet, create s a system that provides a seamless, holistic Battle Command capability and increased battlefield operational capabilities through the implementation of information age technology.  FBCB2/BFT software is designed and developed utilizing a Product Line appr oach and practices as defined by Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute. Core assets are developed and shared across multiple products (i.e. Vehicle, Network Operation Center, Tactical Service Gateway, etc).       The proposed contract ceiling increase is anticipated to be awarded by January 2007 as a modification to Contract W15P7T-04-D-G205.  The required system engineering work will define and implement the Battle Command Product Line (BCPL) and the develop ment of FBCB2  BFT to become the FBCB2 Joint Capabilities Release (JCR). This increased  effort will require the contractor to perform the following major tasks: System Engineering and Integration; Program Management;  Software Maintenance;  System Softwa re Development;  Hardware Development necessary to achieve the objective capabilities specified in the FBCB2 Operational Requirements Document (ORD), User Functional Description (UFD) and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC);  Tactical Internet design engineering;  hardware and software integration into various Army platforms at numerous Army locations;   testing beyond the programs Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) requirements;  technical assistance and support services to the Di gitized Army; engineering, integration and associated upgrades to the Tactical Internet;  enhancement of the Tactical Internet Design to increase performance; development of  the strategic technical vision for the future FBCB2  in a network centric battlef ield, including  use of sensors, robotics and emerging technologies;  generation of  all documentation necessary to accredit the FBCB2 system through the DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program process.         The initial software delivery is required not later than the fourth quarter of FY2007 with subsequent software updates forecasted at least on an annual basis.  The objective FBCB2 system software shal l satisfy all ORD, UFD and JROCM objective requirements. Respondents shall identify their software development business practices to include implementation of the 29 Product Line business practices defined by Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute.   The required additional effort includes development of the Battle Command Product Line (BCPL) in accordance with Software Architecture Design Description (SWADD) document; simplification of the FBCB2 database, Tactical Internet architecture redesign and development including integration with the Joint Network Node (JNN) and Warfighter Information Network (Terrestrial) (WIN T) architecture; improved system configuration and automated management of terrestrial communications networks; enable multi-level int erfaces and multi-level security within FBCB2 software; improve BFT satellite communication network; enable a Type 1 Communications Security (COMSEC) capability for the FBCB2 /BFT commercial mobile satellite communications network; integration and engineer ing with weapon platforms and ABCS systems, and software and hardware design and development in support of the FBCB2 program..  	 Respondents are requested to provide, in writing by the closing date of this market survey, their capability and approach to satisfy all of the above listed requirements to assume Total System Responsibility.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for 2 Camera Systems for Acquiring Lifetime-Based Pressure Sensitive Paint Images.  The cameras are digital CCD cameras that have the capability of acquiring an image with very short exposure times (a few microseconds).  Additionally, the cameras have the capability of accumulating photons on chip increase signal-to-noise ratio (this is required so that lifetime-based imaging of Pressure Sensitive Paints can be accomplished).

Combined enrolled population is apprximately 47,000.

The contract period will be 1 April 2007 through 30 March 2008 with one six month option period.  Requirements include provision of facilities, staffing with healthcare professional and administrative support, provision of equipment, provision of supplies including pharmacy, maintenance,  and furnishing of the facilities, dedicated solely to providing healthcare to DoD ben eficiaries.  This action is being initiated due to existance of adequate facilities, staffing, and support and the short term of this contract.  Changes in established location, staffing, and processes would disrupt the continuity of care for the enrolled population, take excessive amount of time to transition and startup and be cost prohibitive for the short term nature of this requirement.

<DESC>Question - We are a company with lots of personal experience with previous companies doing this type of work; however, as a company we not have the experience.  (The people here have worked together for many years and decided to form this company.)  Would you accept our experience with the companies prior to this?

Answer - Past performance refers to the company's experience.  In the case of no company experience past performance would be rated neutral as stated in the SIR.  However, if during evaluation the resumes of individual staff are found to have exceptional relevant experience it will be considered a strength under the Management and Staffing Approach factor.

We have researched and inquired in the last 2 years for an Aircraft Tubing, bending and flaring kit that will meet the required needs to local manufacture Aircraft tubing to meet real world mission requirements. We have asked for quotes for Parker Hannifin manufactured tubing kits from other companies and they were unable to get access to the product. Only Parker Hannifin authorized suppliers are able to obtain the product.

A.  that has not been determined. 7. Q.  Will the contract make provisions for the addition of CPI increases annually?  A.  we could.  You can state that requirement in your proposal. 8. Q.  When do you anticipate making the solicitation award?  A.  By September 2006.   9.  Q.  The solicitation specifies examinations and remediation.  Is there an expectation that both will be preformed on the same day, or is it contemplated to perform exams on first day and remediation on second under a full schedule?  A.  It depends on the number of individuals being seen per day but it will occur during the same event whether 1 day or 3 day.  End of questions and answers.
