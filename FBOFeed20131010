This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.

Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in it's solicitation for this item.

Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. Surplus material will not be considered.

The required delivery is 330 days. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction.

The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is that technical factors are equal to each other and when combined are equal importance to the performance confidence assessment (past performance). The combined non-cost/price factors are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>The seed project will be made available to offers who proceed to Phase II of the Evaluation Process. The Request for Proposals (RFP) for Phase I will be issued during December 2013. Individual task orders competed among the Successful Awardees will be done using price only factors or price and technical factors. Past performance will be a consideration throughout to determine which awardees will receive further consideration for subsequent task orders.</p>
<p>The evaluation criteria are detailed below. All technical factors are of equal importance. Technical sub factors within technical factors are of equal importance. Technical is approximately equal to price. The Basis of Award for this procurement shall be price and technical factors, which together, constitute a best value to the Government; however, not necessarily the lowest price. The objective is selection of contractors whose overall proposal demonstrates the best value to the Government based on the specified criteria. The government anticipates awarding a maximum of six (6) contracts under this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised as a set-aside for Small Business (FAR 52.219-6) concerns. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered. This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and repair, primarily by design-build or secondarily by design-bid-build, of general building construction at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility (AOR) including but not limited to California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: administration buildings, school buildings, hospitals, auditoriums, fire stations, gymnasiums, office buildings, hangars, laboratories, and parking structures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $33.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $99,000,000. Task orders will range between $8,000,000 and $15,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, and Factor 3 - Past Performance; Phase Two: Factor 4 - Safety; Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 - Energy and Sustainable Design, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no formal pre-proposal conference will be conducted. THE SOLICITATION AND PRE-PROPOSAL PRESENTATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP and pre-proposal presentation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov on or about October 25, 2013.

All personnel supporting the Contract will be required to meet FPS training, certification, suitability standards and the security services to be provided will include:<br /><br /><strong>Basic Services</strong> - Basic Services are the permanent ongoing recurring services at Federal Locations.<br /><br /><strong>Temporary Additional Services (TAS)</strong>&nbsp;- During the term of the Contract, the Government will have requirements for Temporary Additional Services (TAS) beyond the Basic Services requirements. TAS are short term, non-recurring needs for service such as an increase in hours to an existing post or added posts to include the weekend where a public demonstration is taking place over the weekend, addition of posts to provide for increased security for special events or high profile visitor to the building, extension of existing post hours in a building to cover seasonal fluctuations (such as at an IRS building during tax season), etc. Due to the nature of TAS the Contractor may be required to perform these services with little advance notice.<br /><br /><strong>Emergency Security Services</strong> <strong>(ESS)</strong> - The Contractor shall furnish fully qualified PSOs, management, supervision, equipment, supplies and any other cost for sustained emergency surge security force services. Deployments may be to large and small-scale events such as natural disasters, civil disturbances, or other unanticipated events on an as-needed basis.

There will be no "phase-in" period for these requirements. The Contractor shall have sufficient, fully qualified staff to meet all requirements ordered under the ESS CLIN at any time.<br /><br />The training requirements to be provided by the Contractor for all PSOs working under this effort can be broken down into four categories:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One Time Only:<br /></span></strong>40 hour Basic Training<br />Initial Weapons Training<br />Orientation Training<br />Supervisor Training<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Annual:<br /></span></strong>AED<br />CPR<br />Less-Than-Lethal Weapons (i.e. Baton/OC Spray)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Semi-Annual: <br /></strong></span>Weapons<br />Every Three Years:<br />First-Aid<br />Refresher Training<br /><br />This acquisition is for approximately 380,000 hours of Basic Service, 20,000 hours of Temporary Additional Services and 3,500 hours of Emergency Security Services per year. Currently, there are an estimated 205 guards protecting approximately 95 posts at over 55 buildings. The estimated value of this Contract is between $75M and $80M.<br /><br />For purposes of the Sources Sought, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561612 and the small business size standard is $18.5 million. If you believe your firm is capable of providing the requirements described in this Sources Sought, please provide capability information using the attached Sources Sought Questionnaire in excel format via email to Margie Cox Marvel, margaretmary.coxmarvel@hq.dhs.gov by October 17, 2013 at 1400 EST.

Because a misclassified Contract action fails to notify the firms most likely to respond and therefore may violate the Competition in Contracting Act, the Contracting Officer is held responsible for correctly classifying a FedBizOpps notice. A misclassified Contract action must be corrected and re-synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Detailed classification codes are available on the FedBizOpps website at: http://www.FedBizOpps.gov/. <br />

SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICE/COSTS
 
 This is a basic ordering agreement for the period of one year from the date of award with four (4) one (1) year options, in accordance with FAR 16.7.    A contract is formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, when VA agrees to place a patient in the nursing home and the nursing home agrees to accept the patient.  Upon acceptance by the contractor of beneficiaries of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), all terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply during such time as a VA patient remains in that nursing home at the expense of VA.
 
 Upon acceptance of a VA patient by the nursing home, if and when requested by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the contractor shall furnish all supplies and services herein described, at the per diem rates for the levels of care specified below.  VA levels of care are defined in Section D of this agreement.  VA is obligated only to the extent authorized placements of patients are made under this agreement.
 
 B.2 RATE DETERMINATION
 
 The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing homes plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the cost of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local state Medicaid agency (SMA).  Rates established after the effective date of this agreement will require a modification to the agreement.  

 VA shall use Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.
 
 For all levels of nursing care a percentage is added for routine ancillary services/supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen (occasional use), x-ray, laboratory, physician visits, and rental equipment.
 
 Special equipment, e.g. clinitron bed, is/are not considered routine ancillary services (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Rehabilitation therapies shall be provided as a distinct level of care.  Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate.  VA or other payers shall be used for Hospice and Dialysis, as determined by the veteran with VA approval.
 
 B.3 ORAL MEDICATIONS
 
 Oral medications, which comprise more than 8.5% of the per diem rate on a monthly basis, are excluded from that rate.  High drug costs shall be determined or priced using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of the drugs plus a transaction fee of 3% per month.  All calculations shall be made on a monthly basis.  When a high cost drug patient is identified, VA staff must be advised promptly to establish an appropriate course of action, which shall include the provision of the medications by VA.
 
B.4 	ANCILLARY COSTS
Ancillary cost are pre-approved costs for supplies or services not identified as included in the all-inclusive rate or any other pre-authorized rate or schedule or payment for items or services provided under this agreement.  Ancillary costs such as medications, special equipment, rehabilitation therapies, shall not be added to any invoice without written permission of the VA medical center placing the veteran.  If permission is received, the nursing home must also submit the physician's order for the medication/supply, the dispensing log, the supplier and the cost charged by the supplier to the nursing home, and what the nursing home is charging the VA.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK
 
   B.1. This Basic Ordering Agreement shall be conducted under the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care shall be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psycho-social needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, X ray, and other special services for VA patients shall be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided shall include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) established in this BOA shall include the cost of medical care, drugs, laboratory, x ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted.
 
   B.2. Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living, to the maximum extent possible.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
 
   B.3. Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and shall be obtained within 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
   B.4. If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility shall arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days shall be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but shall not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility shall include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
 
   B.5. the VA facility shall approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions shall be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
 
   B.6. Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
  
 B.7.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this BOA dies, the nursing home shall within 48 hours notify the VA office  authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects pending further guidance by VA.
 
   B.8. It is agreed that VA shall have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
 
   B.9. The nursing home shall accept referral of and shall provide all services specified in this BOA for any person determined eligible by the VA Under Secretary for Health or his/her designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting shall not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
 
   B.10. It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA shall provide follow up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back to the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
 
   B.11. All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home shall be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records shall be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records shall be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient that includes at least the following:
 
     B.11.1. Admission identification record.
 
     B.11.2. VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care, or State-approved referral form.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Specimen Containers. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Specimen Containers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Specimen Containers. The QSL for Specimen Containers will be established approximately December 2013 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately January 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Specimen Containers. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Specimen Containers.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Specimen Containers. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $748,395.82. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Twenty product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the twenty product groups, four represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Of those twenty, four items are considered the minimum requirement for Standardization and account for 88.65% ($663,477.96) of the total volume in sales ($748,395.82). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in being added to the QSL will provide a response to the FBO Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses will include detailed information requested in the requirements listed in the FBO Sources Sought notification and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendor must complete and submit the FBO Package Worksheet</strong>. A vendor who cannot open the FBO Package Worksheet may contact the POC as noted in the FBO Sources Sought notification and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email, or hard copy). Upon submission of the requested information, vendor will be provided ship to addresses and requested to provide required products for evaluation as indicated in Evaluation paragraph below. <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for subsequent participation in the Standardization Action. Submissions received after the date listed for closing will be reviewed periodically and vendors will be notified of whether they met or did not meet the QSL requirements within approximately 240 days.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative.

<p>Contractors should be aware that this is a Military Installation and that all access to this installation is granted by the 106 Rescue Wing Security Forces. Prior to making deliveries please contact (631) 723-7478 and follow instructions provided by the Security Forces for access to the 106th Rescue Wing, Gabreski Airport, NY. If a gate pass is not granted to a contractor allowing the delivery of goods, execution of warranty support, or performance of services please contact the contracting officer.<br />A contractor's badge will be issued once the contractor enters the main gate at F.S. Gabreski Airport. Be sure that all of your employees have the proper ID (drivers license, state ID, immigration card, U.S. Passport, etc.). If they do not have the proper ID, they will be turned away.</p>
<p>A list of all prospective contractors (full name, date of birth, social security number, and home address) will be provided to Security Forces by the vendor no less than 21 business days from the date work is expected to start, for the purposes of a criminal history check. Note: All additions, deletions and/or changes to the contractor list provided to security forces will require the 21 work day lead time, unless otherwise agreed upon between Security Forces, Environmental, and Base Contracting, for the purposes of a criminal history check. The following is a guide to who will be allowed access to the installation.</p>
<p>1. All prospective contractors MUST be U.S. citizens or MUST have established and maintain legal residence in the U.S., and be authorized by the US government to work in the United States (i.e. Green card, worker authorization, etc.). All prospective contractors MUST have at least one form of U.S. government issued photo identification (driver's license, U.S. passport, U.S. work visa, etc.) for entry to the installation. Security Forces will review any questionable identification documents for determination as to whether or not said identification is authorized for access to the installation.</p>
<p>2. All prospective contractors, once it has been established that they maintain the appropriate credential as described in paragraph 1 above, are subject to a Criminal History Check. If a prospective contractor is found to have been "arrested" (conviction not required) within the last ten (10) years for any of the following offenses as defined in The New York State Penal Laws: any felony assault; draft evasion; any felony drug charges; Indecent acts or liberties with a child under 16; molestation to include child pornography and sex abuse; kidnapping; manslaughter; murder; rape and related sex offences; robbery; arson; felony criminal mischief; fire arms offences; any grand larceny; burglary and felony larceny charges; any charges related to terrorism; any active warrants from any jurisdiction; and any other offense deemed to be in the best interest of the government to refuse entry to having persons committed them, the prospective contractor will not be allowed legal access to the installation for the purpose of employment, unless otherwise agreed upon by Security Forces, Civil Engineering, Base Contracting, and authorized by the Base Commander.</p>
<p>Note: For the purposes of Contracting services at the 106 RQW, it is implied that, by the contracting agreement, that any and all parties agree to a Criminal History Background Check once entering into any contract with the 106 RQW. Any documents that are provided and found fraudulent to include, but not be limited to driver's licenses, contracting licenses, etc., will result in an arrest and potential termination for default of the contract. All contractors are subject to search in order to obtain entry onto the installation and while working on the installation. Any refusal to submit to a search of their person or vehicle will be deemed as a violent act of aggression against the installation and will be cause for dismissal from the installation and revocation of future privileges and installation access.</p>
<p>A contractor's badge will be issued once the contractor enters the main gate at F.S. Gabreski Airport. Be sure that all of your employees have the proper ID (drivers license, state ID, immigration card, U.S. Passport, etc.). If they do not have the proper ID, they will be turned away.

<DESC>The requirement is to establish a business application-mapping tool that provides the capability to discover and provide visualization of business service interactions and dependencies for both stand-alone hardware operating environments (hosts) and virtual operating environments (VOE) (hosts) in both mid-tier and mainframe environments.  The environments the solution must discover to build business application maps includes Windows and Linux (and VMware Windows and Linux VOEs), Solaris (and Logical Domains (LDOMs), containers and zones), Hewlett Packard Unix (HP-UX) (and Integrity Virtual Machines (IVMs)), IBM Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) (and Logical Partitions (LPARs)), IBM System z operating system (z/OS) (and LPARs, Virtual Machines (VMs), and Linux VMs) as well as communications and storage dependencies.  The solution will provide the capability for DISA to visualize interactions and dependencies of components, in the tool and in an extract, for all business services on both the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) production environment, the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) production environment and on DISA's out of band network.  This visualization will allow DISA to ensure outages or service issues are addressed quickly and effectively.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Specimen Containers. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong></p>
<p>These Specimen Containers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Specimen Containers. The QSL for Specimen Containers will be established approximately February 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Specimen Containers. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Specimen Containers.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Specimen Containers. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual volume in sales of $482,024.53. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Twenty product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the twenty product groups, four represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Of those twenty, four items are considered the requirement for addition to the QSL and account for 85.58% ($412,538.68) of the total volume in sales ($482,024.53). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.</strong> <br />The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived.

<DESC>Reference is made to the September 23, 2013, announcement, solicitation number 2013-11015A, inviting submission of qualifications and a proposal to develop a feasibility study that will evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, and other critical aspects of installing 3 megawatts (MW) of rooftop solar photovoltaics on Cape Town central business district provincial buildings in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.
<p><br />USTDA has received requests to provide the suggested budget for this feasibility study, which is attached to this solicitation.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries as to whether the utility rate information will be provided for the cost/benefit analysis of various solar options and whether time-of-use rates or net metering rates will be offered by the utility. In response to these inquiries, Green Cape Sector Development Agency hereby provides the following clarification:</p>
<p>"Utility rates are generally available and should not be difficult to obtain for the area(s) under consideration. Generally, time-of-use tariffs are only used by large corporates and industries but the contractor will be required to establish the applicable tariffs and time-of-use (if applicable) rates but most importantly apply these in the analysis. The grantee will provide assistance such as the metering data and the applicable account information. The NERSA (the energy regulator) approved tariff increases are widely available but reasonable assumptions would need to be made for medium and long dated forecasts."</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries as to whether the Grantee is contemplating additional non-rooftop sites as part of this project. In response to these inquiries, Green Cape Sector Development Agency hereby provides the following clarification:</p>
<p>"This feasibility study is limited to rooftops and specifically Cape Town central business district provincial buildings. Any eventual project to implement PV solar by the WCG may not necessarily be limited to rooftops and will certainly include areas outside the CBD of Cape Town, including non-administrative type buildings such as hospitals and schools."</p>
<p>USTDA has also received inquiries asking for expectations for the level of detail of the analysis to be conducted as part of the environmental assessment. In response to these inquiries, Green Cape Sector Development Agency hereby provides the following clarification:</p>
<p>"The feasibility study must put the Grantee in a position to fully assess the roll out of full scale implementation of the envisaged projects. The level of detail required must be assessed relative to the complexity of the issue following investigation and must necessarily place the Grantee in a position to make decisions. Where an aspect has more complexity, a greater level of detail will be required."</p>
<p>USTDA is making this information available for the benefit of all prospective bidders. The response date for this RFP remains 10:00 AM local (South Africa) time on November 19, 2013.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS), is conducting a market survey to identify qualified sources for Engineering Services to support the 155mm Excalibur Projectile.  This effort will result in a single award Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Fixed Fee Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) task order contract for FY15-FY19 requirements.  The purpose of this effort is to address various Excalibur Engineering Support requirements to include but not limited to; cost reduction initiatives, producibility efforts, reliability improvement efforts, material obsolescence, software support, component refurbishment within the Excalibur system, and potential development/qualification efforts related to international interoperability.  These requirements at this time are planned to be restricted to Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ who is the current producer of Excalibur Projectiles.   <br>    <br>  The Excalibur Program is for a Precision-Guided, Extended-Range family of 155mm   <br>  projectiles to deliver precise, lethal, cost effective and to fire at ranges of up to 35 km and greater.  The 155mm Excalibur projectile enables the maneuver commander to precisely defeat critical targets while minimizing collateral damage and unexploded ordnance.  This program supports the requirements of the US Army, Swedish Army, and other Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Cases.  It uses an incremental development approach with time-phased improvements in performance capabilities and is currently in production.  <br>    <br>  To be considered as a capable source for this effort, all interested parties must submit the requested information as follows:   <br>    <br>  (a) Provide a detailed description that displays knowledge of the Excalibur Technical Data Package (TDP), which contains data that is proprietary to the current systems contractor (Raytheon Missile Systems) and their subcontractors.  <br>    <br>  (b) Provide evidence of managing cost reduction / producibility efforts on precision munitions.   <br>    <br>  (c) Provide evidence of managing engineering support for reliability improvement efforts on precision munitions.  <br>    <br>  (d) Provide evidence of managing development/qualification efforts related to international interoperability in support of precision munitions.  <br>    <br>  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey.  All submissions are requested to be made within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this publication at no cost to the Government.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.

<DESC>Amendment 05: The purpose of Amendment 05 is to revise the "Response Date" stipulated on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website/page for Broad Agency Announcement No. DARPA-BAA-13-37 to match the closing date currently listed in the BAA (21 October 2014).  The extension of the FBO "Response Date" is primarily to allow the BAA to remain active on FBO website so that TA2 proposals can be submitted per guidance/requirements stipulated in the BAA.  However, as currently depicted in the BAA, full proposals for TA1 and Advanced Studies submitted after the 8 October 2013 due date (initial round of selections) may be reviewed and selected contingent upon the availability of funds (although the likelihood of availability of funding is greatly reduced for TA1 and Advanced Studies proposals submitted after the initial due date of 8 October 2013). For further clarification - NO changes have been made to the BAA - only to the "Response Date" established on the FBO website/page for this BAA.

Various air pollutants exist indoors, including biological pollutants (molds, bacteria, viruses, pollen, animal dander, dust mites, etc.), second hand smoke, combustion pollutants, and other chemicals (formaldehyde, asbestos, radon, etc.). With inadequate ventilation, these contaminants become concentrated and can result in detrimental effects on human health.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Sole Source Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition 
(Simplified Acquisition Procedures $2500 TO $150,000)

Subject:  OLYMPUS FLEXIBLE ENDOSCOPE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR SERVICES
Olympus Flexible Endoscope, Model DUR-D (Serial Number F20111)
		 	
1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity and specific identification of document as a sole source justification for other than full and open competition:

	DEPARTMENT of VETERANS AFFAIRS
	Office of Acquisition and Logistics (OAL)
	National Acquisition Center (NAC)/Business Resource Service Center (BRS) 
	1st Avenue, One Block North of 22nd (Cermak) Street  
	Building #37
	Hines, Illinois 60141-0076

This document constitutes a sole source "Justification and Approval" for purchases of services, 
IAW 6.302-1, on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Service Distribution Center
(SDC), Service and Repair (S&R) Department, Building 37, Hines, Illinois (IL), 60141.

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:

The VA National Acquisition Center, Business Resource Services, Contingency Contracting Department, Hines, IL 60141 proposes by means of other than full and open competition, a need to acquire services and repairs of flexible endoscope model, DUR-D to be performed by original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Olympus America, Inc.; to include, factory original repair parts, labor and shipping.
	
3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:

This acquisition derives from the fundamental nature, mission and objectives of the program office (VA, Hines SDC, S&R Department), who provides a service to VA Hospitals around the country, and some DOD facilities, state side and abroad. The  VA Hines SDC, S&R Department provides non warranty services and repairs for various medical equipment, including but not limited to flexible endoscopes.  Flexible endoscopes are known as critical diagnostic equipment utilized in various medical procedures and is a valuable tool in providing direct patient care.  Relevant to the above stated equipment, for those services and/or repairs that cannot be accomplished in house by VA personnel; they are outsourced to Olympus America, Inc.  







On August 9, 2013 the VA  Hines SDC, S&R Department received an Olympus' flexible endoscope model
DUR-D, S/N F20111 damaged video and complaint of failed leak test.  Equipment was received from the US Army Hospital, Landstuhl, Germany. The VA Hines SDC, S&R Department conducted an initial evaluation of the subject equipment and determined that it could not be repaired in house and repairs would require outsourcing.


4.	An identification of the sole source rationale and statutory authority permitting a sole source acquisition:

This is a specific service provider requirement under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as stated in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  

Rationale:  Olympus America, Inc. has patent rights and proprietary ownership of their products, parts, services and does not authorize a third party service dealer or retailer to service and/or resale their equipment or parts.  As a result, the VA Hines SDC, S &R Department has a Bona Fide need to acquire on a sole source basis, services and repairs of Government owned flexible endoscopes, from Olympus America, Inc. 

5.	A determination by the contracting officer (CO) that the anticipated cost will remain fair and reasonable:

Prices were verified to be consistent with Contractor's commercial price list for services and 
repairs of the DUR-D flexible endoscopes.

6.	A description of the market research conducted and the results of the research, or a statement why market research was not conducted:  

Market research was conducted and it was determine due to the unique nature of subject flexible 
endoscope's repairs and proprietary elements of the services and repairs; Olympus America, Inc.
is the only viable option to provide the required services and repairs to ensure strict adherence to 
manufacturer's specifications.  

7.	Any other facts supporting the sole source justification: 

Other sources, although capable of services and repairs, cannot obtain OEM manufacturer's parts and diagnostic equipment necessary to restore equipment to 100% functionality and to ensure adherence to manufacturer's specifications. In addition, Olympus' parts and repair service are proprietary to Olympus America, Inc. and are not releasable to the general public for equipment repairs. Again, to the best of our knowledge, no other service provider is authorized by Olympus America, Inc. at this time, to perform stated repairs for Olympus flexible endoscope model, DUR-D.

In reviewing this requirement, and discussing the details surrounding the equipment, it's rational to conclude that it would do more harm than good, to the patients of the VA Medical System and the Government, not to establish a sole source acquisition at this time.

8.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services are made:

Contracting activity will continue to advocate brand name or equivalent specification for equipment purchased by VA Medical Centers. The NAC, BRS Department will continue to monitor and seek to identify other vendors that may meet the VA's specialized needs.

9.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: 

None at this time.


10.	Certification: 	I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
