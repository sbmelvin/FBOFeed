It is imperative that the developmental environment matches the operational environment to ensure completeness in testing.  Without the purchase of this software and its associated maintenance, the required testing before fielding new software and/or system architecture changes would not be able to take place.  This could adversely affect Civil Engineers Air Force-wide with the introduction of new software and/or system architecture changes that are not thoroughly tested.  The Government's minimum needs can only be satisfied with the purchase of this hardware and maintenance.  This purchase allows the developmental environment to match the operational environment.  A failure to purchase specified software and maintenance would prevent HQ 754 ELSG from m! eeting current customer requirements of thoroughly tested changes to software and system architecture.

11.  Mandatory Language:
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.  
The Government does not possess the technical data to manufacture this item.
While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC><p>The 61st Contracting Squadron, Los Angeles AFB, CA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for acquisition of RECOVERY- Repairs to Domestic Water Main Valves at Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, California. The Government is soliciting for the award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 237110. The size standard for NAICS 237110 is $33.5M. The government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business) anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which the Defense Distribution Center, New Cumberland, PA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for Optical Memory Laser Cards.  The cards are used as part of an Automated Manifest System.  These cards have the capability to hold 1200 pages of information, and can withstand the harshest military conditions without any loss of data.

General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. is the only source that can provide these cards due to the proprietary nature of the Automated Manifest System.  Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this system, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government.  Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order (FFP) utilizing FAR Part 13 to General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. for the Optical Memory Laser Cards.

Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The delivery date will be 30 days after receipt of the order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 326130 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. 

All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the Optical Memory Laser Cards by 4:00 PM EDT, THURSDAY APRIL 9, 2009 to Daniel Herring, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone:  717-770-6030, FAX:  717-770-5689, or e-mail:  daniel.herring@dla.mil for consideration by the agency.  If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM EDT, THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 2009 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to General Dynamics Information Technology.

RTCT4051  End Trim Piece, 33 ea. RTCT7000 Lightmodule, 33 ea. RTCT6001 Accessary Holder, 33 ea. RTCT6002 Hex Cell Louver, 33 ea. RTCT6003 Snoot, 66 ea. RTCT6010 Q20W MR16/Flood (BAB)lamp.  These items have the following characteristics -  The Recessed-track system combines the flexibility of track lighting with the visual benefits of a recessed solution.  The system consists of a fully enclosed street housing that encompasses the track lighting and the light module (track head).  This system provides full concealment of the track and light module limiting visual glare within the space.  Light modules can be positioned anywhere along the length of the housing.  Additional light modules can be added (up to 50W/linear foot) or existing light modules can be repositioned when needed.  All this can be achieved from below the ceiling.  The recessed housings are available in 2', 3' and 4' lengths of ceiling grid system.  There are a series of extension intersection components that allow from customizing the ceiling layouts.  Continuous runs, rectangular crossing patterns or other configurations are achievable.  Ceiling trims can be field cut to fit the application.  The overall cross-section of the housing is 10" high by 12" wide.  The ceiling aperture is 5" wide by either 46.5" (for 4ft. housing), 34.5" (for a 3 ft. housing), or 22.5" (for a 2 ft. housing)  The light modules can rotate 180 degrees horizontally and up to 45 degrees vertically.  The front ring of the light module is fitted with a high temperature silicone rubber banding that remains cool to the touch and allos hot aiming.  The light modules accept dimmable up to a 50W MR16/12 volt halogen lamp.  For the air traffic control tower cab application, it was determined that a 20W lamp was sufficient.  An electonic transformer is incorporated into each light module simplifying servicing.  All parts are painted matt black to minimize relected glare within the space.  The light modules are fitted with a snoot and hex cell louver to cut down high angle glare from the face of the lamp.  The system is UL and CUL listed as a type non-IC thermally protected recessed incandescent fixture.  It is also I.B.E.W. labeled.  The manufacturer's engineer provides personal site inspections to confirm optimum installation of their products and provides solutions to any possible lighting concerns associated with unique electronic equipment installations of the cab at no extra cost. THESE ITEMS MUST BE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR IMMEDIATE SHIPMENT.  No solicitation is available.  If you have any questions call Kim Erkman, 847/294-7330.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique designcapability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualifiedsource(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). Theapproved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technicaldata that are not economically available to the Government, and the data orknowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternatesource must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualificationprocedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity havingjurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject itemrequires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item isflight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determinedadequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only thesource(s) previously approved by the government for this item have beensolicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such thatan award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not anapproved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the informationdetailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx" Naval Inventory ControlPoint Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochureidentifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company'sexperience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item youhave never made. If your request for source approval is currently beingevaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter whichforwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail toprovide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previoussubmission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not beconsidered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of asource approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/orapproval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time tomeet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continuebased on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Price and Availability (P&A), valid for 12 months, is requested, to include a schedule (timeline) to implement this project.  The P and A will be used to prepare a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) to the Government of Iraq.  The signed LOA will be the basis for a future Request for Proposal (RFP).  Any interested sources please send responses, NLT 27 April 2009, to U.S. Army CECOM SAMD, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-SA-COM, Bruce Ballance, Bldg. 1208W, Fort Monmouth NJ 07703-5000.<BR><BR>Email address: bruce.wayne.ballance@conus.army.mil.  Electronic (email) responses are preferred.<BR><BR>This market survey is to obtain ROM P and A and a timeline to conduct a design phase contract for the Troposcatter Network which shall incorporate troposcatter and-or microwave solutions to best meet the bandwidth requirements of each link.<BR><BR>The design phase shall require the contractor to conduct site surveys in Iraq to define-refine the MOD requirements, to include interfaces to other communications systems such as fiber optics.  As part of the design phase, the contactor must interface with MOD personnel responsible for design approval to capture all customer requirements.  The end product is a Performance Specification that shall be the basis of a separate competitive contract to produce, field, train, and sell-off the Network.<BR><BR>The goal of the design phase is three deliverables, a Network Design Document (Performance Specification), a draft Training Plan, and a draft Operation and Maintenance (O and M) plan<BR><BR>1.  The Network Design Document will be provided by the US Government to the Iraqi MoD as one deliverable for review and approval.  The Ministry will be under no obligation to build the Network until it specifically provides written authorization to proceed in the form of a new or amended LOA.  <BR><BR>The Performance Specification shall be generic and suitable as the basis for a competitive solicitation.  It shall not list equipment by specific manufacture name or part number (s) but shall specify required capabilities.<BR><BR>As a minimum, the Performance Specification produced shall contain:<BR><BR>- Specific site locations<BR>- Bandwidth between sites to meet customer requirements for each link<BR>- Basis for Microwave vs. Troposcatter selected to complete each link<BR>- Quad vs. Dual diversity site recommendation as related to bandwidth requirements<BR>- Interfaces to existing and planned Iraqi communications systems to include drawings and specifications obtained from the MOD as required<BR>- Block diagrams indicating the generic components of each site to include known Iraqi communication systems/equipment to be interfaced at the site<BR>- New and or modified buildings and associated infrastructure required at each site to include the source of supply (contractor or Iraq MOD).

The contractor shall be required to possess the appropriate clearance and access to all Network offices and sites.  The MoD will provide security at all sites.  The contractor will be responsible for the security of its personnel and property during transportation to and from work sites, when in living quarters and when otherwise not located on a work site.<BR><BR>2.  The draft Training Plan will be as outlined below:<BR><BR>Contractor Furnished Training in three phases:<BR><BR>Training Phase One: Classroom Training.  This phase should begin within 30 days of contract award and consist of classroom training conducted at the contractors facility.  This Line Item should cover all travel expenses for each individual student to include airport transfer, airfare, hotel, meals, and visa as well as course tuition, books, and fees.  This would constitute one class that would be taught in two iterations by the contractor with twelve (12) students per class (24 total).  The goal of this training is to impart the baseline knowledge required to perform all aspects of planning, program management, operations, and maintenance up to the 3rd level.  The following are the Terminal Learning Objectives (TLOs).<BR><BR>- Develop a frequency allotment plan without the aid of contractor assistance.<BR>- Perform a complete site installation without the aid of contractor assistance.<BR>- Perform all preventative and routine maintenance tasks for all pieces of network equipment, to include generators.<BR>- Further TLOs as recommended by the contractor.<BR><BR>An Arabic copy of all the training materials and books used in this training will be provided to the MoD.  There should be a test at the end of every week with review and re-test if needed.  The translator involved with this class must be fluent in Iraqi Arabic and have a background in communications so that he understands the concept of what is being taught in English and the students understand what he is saying in Arabic.<BR><BR>Training Phase Two: Hands-On Training.  This phase will consist of hands-on training on an actual Troposcatter site built specifically as a training laboratory at the Iraqi Signal School (ISS) in Taji, Iraq.  The site should have all equipment normally installed in an actual network site.  Classroom space will be provided by the MoD at the ISS as required.<BR><BR>Training Phase Three: On-the-Job Training (OJT).  In this phase, the 24 students will shadow the contractor as they perform all O&M tasks as well as site tear-down, transfer, and installation.  The contractor will mentor the students on the performance of these tasks.<BR><BR>3.  A draft O&M Plan will outline a proposal for vendor provided O&M for a 12-month period after cutover and final acceptance, as outlined below.  This O&M plan shall include a time-phased transition plan for the transfer of O&M tasks from the contractor to the MoD.<BR><BR>In-Country Contractor Furnished Operations and Maintenance Services:<BR><BR>1.  All preventative and routine maintenance for all equipment, to include generators, for a period of (12) months.<BR>2.  Quality Assurance<BR>3.  Warranty Support for an additional one year after completion of site acceptance testing.<BR><BR>The contractor shall engineer, implement, install, operate, and maintain all components necessary to provide these required services.<BR><BR>Note that a Requirements Document (RD) was provided in a Letter of Request (LOR) from the Iraqi Ministry of Defence (MOD) and shall guide the conduct of the design phase.  The RD describes a program combining design, production, fielding, and installation into one phase.  The program reflected above has a standalone design phase contract, followed by a separate contract for production, fielding, and installation.  Please contact Mr. Ballance for a copy of the RD which contains site locations, distance between sites, required bandwidth, general specifications, troposcatter specifications, Network management and configuration specifications, and the Iraqi data networks that will operate over this Troposcatter Network. <BR><BR>Requirements Overview (extracted from the RD):<BR><BR>The Ministry of Defense (MoD) of Iraq requires an FMS Case to create a terrestrial transmission network and a data delivery service as the backbone for its military installations.  This backbone will include the ability to support mobile systems to allow military units the ability to deploy around the country.  This network shall incorporate troposcatter, and microwave solutions as selected according to best meet the requirements of each link.  Troposcatter will be used as a mobile-tactical solution and therefore troposcatter -entry points- will be required.  <BR><BR>This Network needs to provide reliable low-cost bandwidth for the Iraqi Defense Network (IDN) data network, Defense Private Network (DPN), and the Iraqi Department of Veterans Affairs (IVA) data network, and other networks as required.  This system will replace the current MoD VSAT system as the primary source of bandwidth for the MoD.  This FMS case shall provide, as a minimum, equipment for 17 sites, two Network Operations Centers (NOC), Operations and Maintenance (O and M), and training.  In addition, the case should allow for additional sites to be brought online.<BR><BR>This network must provide the following services: internet, secure intranet, video teleconferencing secure and unsecure, VoIP, SVoIP, cellular voice, and any other IP service.   In the future, other Iraqi government sector IP transport services will become available, and the MoD will take advantage of these services.  Accordingly, the Network created from this FMS case will be required to interface with these future government services.  The engineering solution should consider Minister of Communications and others initiatives in the Iraqi government sector and take advantage of such capabilities where appropriate. If a fiber line has already been laid for another Iraqi government network, then this network should utilize it.  The contractor will utilize current government infrastructure whenever possible to minimize cost and to maximize robustness and diversity within the network. Using existing infrastructure will facilitate the implementation of a solution in the shortest amount of time.<BR><BR>The contractor shall set up this system and provide one year of O&M to include training and a network monitoring and control capability (NOC) with the intention to transition it to the MoD during one year.  After the network is established, and the Iraqis have achieved the appropriate level of training, they will take over O and M. <BR><BR>EMAIL bruce.wayne.ballance@conus.army.mil<BR>

The information provided in this announcement is all information the Government has available at this time. There are no specifications, drawings, bid packages, or source lists available.
The principal components of the work to be performed include:  
BACKGROUND:The Land Atmosphere Water Simulator (LAWS) is an integrated, flexible, and scalable tool for efficiently developing and comparing alternative water management strategies with either historical or forecasted water supply and demands conditions. LAWS provide users with the capability to evaluate alternative water management strategies based on multiple factors including:
"	Meteorological Conditions"	Water management practices"	Vegetation types
Daily agricultural and municipal water demands are calculated by LAWS based on the acreages and types of vegetation growing within a water management area. These water demands are computed using the well established crop coefficient method (Allen et al, 1998) and either historic, current or forecasted potential evapotranspiration (ET) data. Using soil moisture based water scheduling techniques (Goldhammer and Synder, 1989), LAWS can be used to simulate the amounts and timing of agricultural and municipal water demands in multiple water management areas.
In LAWS, these demands can be associated with one or more sources of supplies including reservoirs, groundwater, and/or reused drain water. Reservoir operations and water accounting features are an integral part of a LAWS simulation. A network model of the water delivery system simulates the daily management of reservoir releases in rivers and main canals.
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project are to analyze the effects of future climate changes on agricultural and municipal water demands within one or more Central Valley Project (CVP) water service areas. The studies shall address the effects of projected changes in demographics and increased frequency, duration, and intensity of extremes in meteorological conditions affecting water demands including droughts, concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and other meteorological conditions affecting ET. The project shall also examine how water management, infrastructure and land use practices may be altered to adapt to future changes in the quantity and seasonality of CVP water supplies.
STATEMENT OF WORK:
Task 1: Service Area and Future Scenario SelectionThe contractor shall work with Reclamation technical experts in the Division of Planning to select one or more water service areas that shall be simulated in detail. The contractor shall evaluate the availability of the necessary LAWS input data in various service areas, identify areas meeting the requirements for a LAWS simulation, identify missing and/or incomplete data, suggest ways to resolve input parameter uncertainty and make recommendations regarding final service area selections.
For municipal water use within the selected service area, the contractor shall work with Reclamation to select a minimum of 2 future population growth scenarios. The contractor shall work with Reclamation technical experts to identify a minimum of 4 future climate scenarios that are appropriately downscaled to the selected service area. The time period for the modeling is from late 20th century to the end of the 21st century.
Deliverables:Under this Task, the deliverable shall be participation in meetings with Reclamation and providing a technical memorandum describing the sources of available data for the simulations, documentation of the criteria used in the decision making process, and rationale for the final selections.
Task 2: Model PreparationThe contractor shall obtain the data required for a LAWS simulation and prepare this information for input into the LAWS model. This information includes preparation of reference crop ET (ETo) and CO2 time series for each future climate scenarios for selected services area. The contractor work closely with Reclamation technical experts to develop appropriate model parameters for representing the physical characteristics for soils, vegetation coefficients, crop rotations, planting and harvesting dates, irrigation system and landscape types, soil water management criteria, urban user categories and per capita water use appropriate to the selected water services area(s).
The contractor shall develop and implement in LAWS algorithms to simulate the effects of increased CO2 concentrations on plant transpiration.  The contractor shall obtain Reclamation approval before proceeding to Task 3.
Deliverables:The contractor shall provide a technical memorandum documenting the sources of the data, methods used to transform data and the rationale for selecting model parameters. The contractor shall also deliver to Reclamation any intermediary products and software tools developed for the purpose of model preparation.
Task 3: Model SimulationsThe contractor shall develop, perform and analyze 4 future climate scenarios for each of the two demographic levels to quantify potential changes agricultural and municipal water demands based on changes in meteorology and demographics in the service area. The analysis shall quantify trends and statistics regarding annual, seasonal, and monthly water demands over the simulation period.
Based on these results, the contractor shall perform a minimum of 3 adaptation strategy scenario simulations designed to quantify how various combinations of water management and infrastructure changes can deployed over the simulation period to balance differences in future water supply and demand in the service area(s).  The contractor shall perform an analysis to quantify trends and statistics regarding annual, seasonal, and monthly water demands, shortages and surpluses over the simulation period based on each of the adaptation strategies.
Deliverables:The contractor shall prepare a written report documenting the assumptions, methods and results of the simulations. This report shall be provided in the form of an electronic document (Word format) with accompanying data files for developed for running the simulations. In addition, any intermediary or final work products such as GIS maps, databases, spreadsheets or pre- and post-processing software developed to perform the simulations shall be provided in electronic to Reclamation.
Task 4: Model Simulations of Additional Service Areas (OPTION TASK) The purpose of this Task is to perform additional work of the same nature as described in Task 1, 2 and 3 above, but in additional service areas. Based on the results obtained during the performance of the Tasks 1, 2 and 3, Reclamation may request the contractor to perform additional applications of the model to supplement the results obtained in the work described above. 
Deliverables:If performed, the deliverables under this Task shall be the same as described in Tasks 1, 2 and 3 above. 

Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION- ENTERPRISE WORKFLOW TOOL 

1. INTRODUCTION
This document is a market research Request for Information (RFI) for a single enterprise workflow tool for the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS).  The current aim of DLIS is to procure and implement a technical solution that receives, sorts and routes input requests; provides customized research screens depending on type of input request; and generates data input to the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS).  

The structure of the enterprise workflow tool will be distributed across DLIS; using the software to connect employees into one cohesive, transparent working community. Together with workload tracking, the organization will be able to monitor work effectively and therefore optimize the workforce.

The technical solutions needed for the initiative fall into three broad areas of work; but all pieces should flow seamlessly together: 

	A workflow manager 
	A customizable screen to view data/information for research purposes  
	A data input tool 

For efficiency reasons, the successful implementation of the enterprise workflow tool is centred on the desire that data be sent from multiple sources into a single workflow manager.  

1.1 Scope of the Request for Information
Potential suppliers should note that this Request for Information is for guidance leading to a process of a final solution selection, and is for the supply and help with the operation of:

	A robust enterprise workflow tool to include collaboration requests
	A reporting tool

DLIS is seeking innovative and cost-effective solutions, which will meet the evolving requirements of the project. 

It is hoped that from the RFI responses that DLIS will be able to select and approve its solution to subsequently begin development/procurementconcept refinement, technology development and eventually procurement.
2. BACKGROUND
A short description of the primary type of workload to be completed by the enterprise workflow tool follows:
2.1 FLIS 
A large portion of the workload DLIS performs revolves around FLIS and the information necessary to keep the FLIS data base current.   For this reason, it is helpful to understand how the FLIS system works.

FLIS is the primary component of the Federal Catalog System (FCS) which was mandated by the Defense Cataloging and Standardization Act through Public Law 82-436, Chapter 539, 1 Jul 52 and is regulated by Department of Defense (DoD) 4100.39-M.  The intent of FLIS is to record a unique item identifying number for items of supply based on a part number and supplier.  In order to define the unique item identifying numbers, FLIS allows for a systemic, standardized approach to naming, classifying, and describing an item of supply, as well as, a mechanism to distribute item of supply data to customers.  This process is referred to as cataloguing because the FCS is an electronic catalog identifying the attributes of DoD procured part numbers based on suppliers.

The information in the FLIS data base relates to military activities, Federal civil agencies, participating foreign countries, and private industry.  Management information is processed in the following areas: supply management, item identification, tailored data products, DoD Interchangeability and Substitutability (I&S) family data, standardization, and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code Management.  General information about the FLIS system can be found here: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/PDFs/Procedures/vol01.pdf. 

The FLIS system is very robust in supporting legacy customers that communicate via standardized legacy formats, however the logistics landscape is rapidly changing.  The emergence of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) based supply chain systems, Performance Based Logistics, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), and an increased need for master data exchange is driving the need to modernize the FLIS system.  Evaluating workflow options and methods in which the database is updated is a crucial beginning to true modernization of the system.

2.1.1 Scenarios for use:

The Federal Catalog Program is composed of those tasks that build the comprehensive logistics data record utilized to identify, requisition, ship, store, dispose and make other logistics decisions related to an item of supply during its operational life cycle.  The tasks in this process include:

Item Name Assignment:
	Designation of commonly recognized noun or noun phrase that answers What is it?
	Based on availability of technical data and other tools

Item Entry Control:
	Filtering process which scrutinizes potential candidates for inclusion in federal catalog
	Manual and systemic comparisons done with existing items and standards

Item Identification Preparation:
	Recording of characteristic data to describe the physical/functional attributes of an item of supply
	Based on availability of technical data

Data Maintenance:
	Actions necessary to ensures complete, accurate, and current logistics data records
	Results of service requests, system incompatibility notices, etc.

Requests for Supply Support:
	Requests to record user interest, assign management data, and review/accept substitutes
	Originate from requests by service/agency to be a user of item managed by another service/agency

The above tasks are just a sample of the types of workload DLIS performs.  The proposed solution should be robust enough to cover a wide range of scenarios and workload.

<DESC>For its calibrations in nanometer-scale length metrology for the semiconductor and other nanotechnology industries, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST), seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an automated atomic force microscope (AFM) with the capability of measuring critical dimensions (CD) and the dimensions of other nanoscale features on surfaces. 

NIST will also require the full time services of a development engineer or scientist to work on-site at NIST for one year to bring the tool into operation, train NIST staff, develop measurement and analysis procedures, and maintain the hardware and software. 

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a CD-AFM that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small business manufacturers are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

The required CD-AFM technology must have the following capabilities: probe tips with horizontal projections that provide contact with vertical sidewalls; and sensor technology capable of detecting surface proximity in two orthogonal directions in order to track both horizontal and vertical surface profiles and the transition regions between them. 

The intended measurands include linewidth, trench width, sidewall angle, pitch, height, surface roughness, sidewall roughness, and line width roughness among others. These features are created during semiconductor manufacturing by the lithography and etch process steps.  Other features to be measured include but are not limited to nanoscale features on data storage devices, micro-optics, and semiconductor masks.  

Requirements for the CD-AFM for 2D and 3D imaging of semiconductor structures are:

1) An automated wafer handling system for 200 mm and 300 mm wafer;

2) A recipe for positioning samples in the system relative to the probe tip to within plus or minus 1 micrometer;

3) Sensor and probe technology capable of tracking surface proximity in two orthogonal directions in order to measure the horizontal and vertical surface profiles and the transition regions between them;

4) Capability to measure surface profiles and surface roughness including, but not limited to, concave and convex sidewalls and 3D shapes such as a portion of the surface of a particle and the contours of surface features;

5) Z-axis range of motion at least 6 micrometers during measurements;

6) Vertical resolution or root mean square noise level, which ever is greater, less than 0.05 nm;

7) Capability to scan regions as large as 50 micrometers by 50 micrometers;

8) Scanner to have deviations from straightness in the X and Y scan directions less than 10 nm;

9) Line width, intermittent contact, deep trench, and contact modes of operation; 

10) Stage drift less than 1nm per hour;

11) X, Y, and Z-axis linearity less than 0.01% defined as one half of the peak to valley deviations from a straight line divided by the scan range;

12) Z-axis short-term measurement reproducibility of less than plus or minus 0.1 nm;

13) XY-plane pitch measurement reproducibility to be less than plus or minus [0.1 nm plus 0.1% of the distance traveled] for distances up to 3 micrometers;

14) Meets (SEMI E10-0304 definitions) on reliability and uptime; 

15) Class 100 clean room enclosure;

16) Static discharge capability;

17) The qualifications of the engineer/scientist include research experience in physics, electrical engineering, or mechanical engineering, experience in the application of atomic force microscopy to industrial problems, and experience in the measurement of critical dimensions for semiconductor applications. 

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice. 

Companies that manufacture these types of systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to carol.wood@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. 

The report should include achievable specifications, qualifications of development engineers and/or scieintists and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 
1. Name and business size of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided; 
2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address); 
3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems; 
4. Indication of whether each instrument (including installation) for which specifications are sent to carol.wood@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s);
 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC><p>This is the public notice for acquisitions over $10,000.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at MacDill AFB, FL intends to issue a fixed price purchase order to PRC-Desoto, a division of PPG Aerospace, Kenneshaw, GA for the following exterior paint used for the NOAA AOC WP-3D aircraft.</p>
<p>12 gals White PRC-DeSoto Manufacturer serial No. 8201F17925MPG22K<br />15 gals Gray PRC-DeSoto Manufacturer serial No. 8800F16440CAGZTX<br />2 gals Red PRC-DeSoto Manufacturer serial No. 8800F11136CAGZTX<br />1 gal Flat Black PRC-DeSoto Manufacturer serial No. 8211F370381KY22K <br />2 gals Bahama Blue PRC-DeSoto Manufacturer serial No. 8800106215CAGZTX<br />2 gals Gloss Blue PRC-DeSoto Manufacturer serial No. 8800F15044CAGZTX</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is for supplies for which the Government has determined are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supply item will satisfy agency requirements under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). NOAA AOC operates two hurricane hunter aircraft that fly into severe weather over the open ocean. The aircraft encounters heavy rain, hail, grapple, and salt residue while flying into hurricane winter storms and other weather related phenomenon. AOC has determined that the exterior paint manufactured by PRC-DeSoto, a division of PPG Aerospace, stands up the best against these in-flight conditions as it does not peel, chip or deteriorate. The colors specified above must provide exact match of existing colors previously applied to the aircraft. Purchasing the paint from PRC-DeSoto is in the best interest of the Government by saving cost and time by using this proven paint. Additionally, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation supplies may be considered to be available from only one source when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received by close of business on April 1, 2009 will be considered by the Government. Responses can be faxed to Ron Anielak at (816)274-6951 or sent via email to Ronald.f.anielak@noaa.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete the acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested responsible business sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit offers which will be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to provide the exact item as described above; and sufficient information that describes the firm's knowledge of exterior aircraft paint. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required supplies as stated herein.</p>

<SUBJECT>Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Data Acquisition System
<SOLNBR>NRMAF000-9-08493
<RESPDATE>040609
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL), located in Ann Arbor, MI intends acquire one Seabird SBE 19plusV2 Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTDs) Data Acquisition systems.
<p>The SBE 19plusV2 conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) data acquisition systems are necessary for water quality sampling efforts in Saginaw Bay as part of the NOAA Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research (CSCOR) funded project, "Adaptive Integrated Framework (AIF): a new methodology for managing the impacts of multiple stressors in coastal ecosystems." This project will require a CTD that can be easily deployed from a small boat (25'). The government requires an electrode-type conductivity cell that is not affected by external fouling and standard sensors for temperature and depth. The government requires sensors to measure chlorophyll a (Turner CYCLOPS-7 chlorophyll fluorometer), phycocyanin (Turner CYCLOPS-7 phycocyanin fluorometer), Quantum scalar PAR (4 pi). This instrument must also have three additional inputs for two transmissometers for the measurement of turbidity and one optical dissolved oxygen sensor. The government owns the required transmissometers for turbidity, so purchasing a compatible platform is necessary to utilize these instruments without the additional expense of purchasing new instruments. This many sensors requires six (6) analog sensor inputs. Also required is a high sampling rate (10 times/sec) and external switch to initiate data logging. The CTD should have 600m plastic housing and a stainless steel protective cage, in addition to all necessary cables and mounting apparatus.</p>
<p>The Seabird SBE 19plusV2 CTD appears to be the only oceanographic data recorder that will meet these requirements. The government has considered the YSI 6600 V2-4 however it only has 4 analog channels, does not have a PAR sensor and therefore is not a viable option. The Government also considered the General Oceanics 316CTD however it does not have a Turner CYCLOPS-7 fluorometer. The Seabird SBE 19plusV2 meets the governments' instrument requirements for its water quality sampling efforts in Saginaw Bay, with all of the required sensors and 6 input channels. Additionally, GLERL already owns other Seabird instruments, and thus has the capacity for interchange of parts and sensors when necessary for greater flexibility and efficiency.</p>
<p>System Specifications: The CTD must be able to accept an Optode 4175 serial input and have the necessary extra analog channels to host the six (6) sensors needed to meet project data collection requirements. Systems must be able to be deployed at the required depth.</p>
<p>The electrical and mechanical requirements listed below place minimal demands on size, weight, buoyancy, and power required for this instrument.</p>
<p>Electrical<br />. Power - alkaline batteries or external power 9-18 VDC or wider<br />. Sensor power out from CTD - at least 500 mA @ 10.5 - 11 VDC<br />. Samples - Conductivity, Temperature, Depth - 355,000 or more<br />. Sensor input range - 0-5VDC; 6 differential A/D channels<br />. RS-232 sensor data input channel<br />. RS-232 system interface<br />Mechanical<br />. Diameter - 3.9 inches<br />. Length - 31.80 inches<br />. Weight in water - 5 lbs</p>
<p>Equipment is needed within 35 days. The government knows of no other company able to supply this type of equipment besides Sea-Bird. Only the Seabird CTD will meet planned scientific data collection goals. Firms who believe they have a product that will meet all the requirements specified herein, including form fit, and function, and delivery must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the supply and satisfy the Government's needs. Firms must provide descriptive literature on the equipment being offered. In addition shall include name, telephone number, and address of concerns for which you have furnished this type of equipment previously. Interested parties must respond within (10) days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. through the commercial acquisition process. The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505. The government now requires all contractors submit their Certification and Representation thru the on-line Business Partner Network (BPN). The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Contractors should go on-line at www.bpn.gov. Faxed responses can be sent to 816-274-6983, Attn: Sharon Walker or emailed to Sharon.walker@noaa.gov.</p>

STATEMENT of Objectives
Background:  The Office of Surface Mining, Mid-Continent Region (MCR) currently owns one borehole video system that was purchased in August of 2006.  Since its purchase, the camera system has been used in a variety of projects completed across the MCR in cooperation with various State programs.  The projects include domestic well investigations, documenting voids beneath a subsiding highway in preparation for grouting; examining flooded, abandoned mine shafts scheduled for closure or treatment of acid mine drainage, a lake investigation, and various borehole studies.  This type of survey is an invaluable tool for conducting subsurface investigations for both active mining and abandoned mine land projects. Since the acquisition in August of 2006, improvements have been made to borehole video technology and equipment that provide the user with greater flexibility and improved viewing capabilities.  These improvements include a reduction in the diameter of the motorized pan-tilt attachment that allows the equipment to be used in smaller openings (i.e. small-diameter wells).  The operation of the motorized pan-tilt has been modified with the ability to pan and tilt the camera head by remote control using a joy stick rather than having to complete cycles to view 360 degrees as in the MCRs current model.  Both the black and white and color cameras are now available in stainless steel in addition to the CPVC construction, and the viewing capabilities have improved.  Also, the more recent version of the borehole video system allows the user to manually activate the camera LED lights independently of additional light sources.  Due to the improvements listed above, the MCR is pursuing a replacement to its existing borehole video system to better serve our customers in subsurface investigations.  In addition to the improvements, the depth capability of the current MCR camera system has been reduced due to the removal of over 20 feet of cable damaged during normal operation as a result of extensive use.  The MCR will utilize the existing 500 feet of pipe string, canopy, portable battery, auxiliary lights, and other ancillary equipment that was purchased for use with the original camera setup with the upgraded system.  The MCR would like to purchase the new borehole video system by the end of March to prepare for field work in the spring of 2009.  The system will be used to conduct all subsurface investigations following acquisition unless demand requires both the upgraded and current system to be in use simultaneously. The system shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:1.	 Motorized winch with tripod, OSD, control panel, centralizer, camera lights on/off circuit for standard stainless steel cameras2.	Deluxe case3.	Motorized pan-tilt 1  inch diameter St/Jr cameras only4.	Stainless steel color camera  1 5/8 inch Diameter5.	Stainless steel B/W camera 1 5/8 inch Diameter6.	1000 feet of cable  Approximately 300 meters7.	DVD recorder8.	7 inch LCD high resolution and high brightness color monitor  sun shad and winch mounting bracket9.	Adjustable super eight light10.	Compass attachment11.	Inverter 300 watt  true sine wave12.	Microphone13.	Winch manual hand crank
Deliverables/Warranty:  The Contractor shall provide a minimum of a One (1) Year Warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and labor.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) Joint Munitions & Lethality (JM&L)Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems is seeking information from Industry on the development of a common Global Positioning System (GPS) form factor or possibly multiple form factors with required functionality and interfaces that can be used in mortar and cannon artillery guidance applications.  
The Government is planning to use Draper Labs to support development of a Performance Specification and Mechanical, Electrical and Software Interface Control Documents (ICDs) for a Common GPS for Artillery and Mortar guidance applications.  It is anticipated that this effort will begin in April 2009. The Government may use this GPS Specification and the ICDs as requirements for the Precision Guidance Kit-2 (PGK-2) acquisition.

The planned approach and timeline are:
-Draft specification (Spec) and ICDs will be released for industry comments approximately 90 days after initiation of the Draper task. 

- A 30 day period for industry review prior to an initial Interface Control Working Group (ICWG) meeting, with a follow up ICWG 45 days later. 
-Release the final Spec and ICD approximately 30 days after the second ICWG.

The Government is interested in feedback from both the potential GPS suppliers and the potential cannon artillery and mortar guidance applications prime contractors on the above approach with specific responses to the following:
-	The respondents willingness to provide comments to the draft spec and ICD. 
-	The respondents willingness to participate in the two ICWGs.
-	Any suggested changes to this approach.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this notice is for informational purposes only. This is a supplemental notice to Special Notice F3G3EA9035A001. The following is the fULL J&amp;A associated with the previous referenced Special Notice.
<p>MEMORANDUM FOR 99 CONS</p>
<p>FROM: 99 CPTS/FMF</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Single Source to Purchase Maintenance for Finance Kiosks</p>
<p>1. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: <br />The justification in the below report was provided by the Department of the Air Force<br />Air Force Accounting &amp; Finance Office (AFAFO):</p>
<p>2. REQUIRING AGENCY:</p>
<p>Department of the Air Force<br />Air Force Finance &amp; Accounting Office<br />6760 East Irvington Place<br />Denver, CO 80279<br /><br />3. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED: A procurement action to DynaTouch is essential to provide military personnel and their families with vital pay and personnel information via public access kiosk technology. The Department of the Air Force, AFAFO requires the standardization of existing TIPS Air Force OneStop&#61652; customer service kiosks. The TIPS Air Force OneStop is an existing, proven, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) turnkey kiosk solution that includes software and content modules developed by DynaTouch. It is the only customer service kiosk that has received a Certificate of Networthiness (CoN) from the Air Force CIO. Over 80% of all Department of Defense customer service kiosks currently in operation around the world have been developed by DynaTouch and are compatible with the OneStop platform. Hundreds of DynaTouch kiosks have already been deployed to provide military personnel with convenient, user-friendly access to vital information and web-based services. The standardization and continued deployment of the Air Force OneStop kiosk will provide a quantum leap forward for morale and mission readiness as military and civilian personnel will be able to readily access vital information in convenient, high-traffic on-base locations, resulting in an increase to overall force productivity. Typically, personnel without Internet access at home or at work have not had access to essential information unless they could physically visit an on-base customer service office. As a result of past hiring freezes and reductions in staff, the availability of on-base customer service personnel has diminished, resulting in reduced levels of service and, in some cases, reduced hours of operation.</p>
<p>4. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS: The Air Forces's requirement is to expand and standardize the self-service delivery of information via kiosk technology for military personnel who do not have Internet access readily available or who are traveling either TDY or PCS. The Air Force is implementing a decision to leverage the investments already made in DynaTouch kiosks and to maximize the usefulness of existing and future customer service kiosks by deploying a standardized product - the Air Force OneStop. The TIPS Air Force OneStop kiosk is an existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product with a branded identity that provides user-friendly access to DoD forms, online services, and thousands of Air Force and DoD web pages. DynaTouch is the only company known that has already developed, installed and now supports hundreds customer service kiosks at DoD installations worldwide. These existing kiosks represent a critical component to the successful implementation of comprehensive, self-service information network accessible worldwide and consistent with the fielding schedule necessary to maintain a positive atmosphere for morale among military members. It would be impossible to duplicate the capabilities of the existing OneStop kiosk without a negative mission impact attributable to duplicating the existing design, testing, programming and data collection effort. It would also be impossible to duplicate or transfer the database, content module and software that DynaTouch has developed and currently owns within existing resource constraints. The expansion of the existing kiosk network, developed, installed and supported by DynaTouch, is the most effective means of satisfying this requirement. This requirement is to expand the existing TIPS Air Force OneStop kiosk network throughout the Air Force, as funds become available.</p>
<p>5. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: IAW FAR 6.302-1, 10 USC 2304(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>6. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AUTHORITY: The DynaTouch "TIPS Air Force OneStop" kiosk is an essential component critical to enable worldwide, self-service delivery of vital information to military personnel, civilian personnel and their families. DynaTouch is the only contractor that has developed a turnkey kiosk solution with a DoD-wide database of customer-focused, self-service information. DynaTouch developed and owns the software that manages the database, which consists of the master set of Department of Defense and Air Force display content for the OneStop kiosk. DynaTouch developed the database as a result of an extensive effort compiling data from individual contracts for single Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps installations, not by any DoD or Air Force-wide program or mandate; therefore, DynaTouch developed, owns and maintains the database. The database provides access to extensive kiosk display content that is appropriate for and readily available to utilize in support of the task completion. The database includes thousands of "kiosk-friendly" links to Air Force and DoD web-based content, on the following topics: military pay, civilian pay, travel pay, personnel matters (officer / enlisted / civilian / retirees), forms and applications, online services, FAQs, what's new, health and wellness, family support, housing and lodging, personal property/household goods, relocation assistance, local services, and much more. DynaTouch is the only company known that has developed an integrated approach to providing self-service information to military pay and personnel customers. Many enhancements and improvements have been incorporated into the DynaTouch kiosk systems over the last fifteen years as a result of the company gaining vast knowledge about the needs of their Department of Defense customers. It would be impossible to duplicate the Air Force OneStop kiosk solution without years of design, testing, programming and data collection effort. As a result of past hiring freezes and reductions in staff, the needs of AFAFO to maintain high and consistent levels of customer service are immediate. Successful completion of task requirements is predicated on utilization of the DynaTouch kiosk.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE: Offers were not solicited from any other source due to the unique nature of the requirement described above. The future functionality of the kiosk network is dependent upon the existing DynaTouch database, content module and software platform. The DynaTouch database, content module and software platform are required to effectively leverage investments already made, which allow for expediting the delivery of necessary information and services to accommodate mission readiness requirements.<br /><br />7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: The anticipated cost to the Government is expected to be fair and reasonable based on pricing available under the Federal Supply Schedule and pricing available under the Air Force Non-Appropriated Fund Purchasing Office, both of which were negotiated and awarded based on fair and reasonable pricing.<br /><br />8. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET SURVEY CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS A MARKET SURVEY WAS NOT CONDUCTED: A formal market survey was not completed due to the very specific nature of the requirement and the required implementation schedule.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: None.</p>
<p>10. A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: None.</p>
<p>11. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING ANY<br />SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: The AFAFO programs and initiatives will review the feasibility of utilizing alternate sources without detriment to the delivery of essential information to military and civilian personnel for future requirements.</p>
<p>12. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION: I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition was accurate and complete at the time of assessment to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Tiburon Associates, Inc.<br />1421 Prince Street, Suite 210<br />Alexandria, VA 22314</p>
<p><br />NOTE: Responses to this RFI are due no later than 27 April 2009. If late information is received, it may be considered by the Government Evaluation Team, depending on agency time constraints.</p>
<p>GENERAL INTENT</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Air Force, as the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for the Defense Production Act (DPA) is supporting the AEST&amp;M Program, and provides this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) inviting industry to provide information on potential topics for the Advanced Energy Storage Technology and Manufacturing (AEST&amp;M) Roadmap Development. Industry responses to the RFI will be assessed and may assist in identifying potential future elements for the AEST&amp;M Roadmap (2011-2015).</p>
<p>Note: There is no guarantee that any submitted topic will become an AEST&amp;M project and responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in all responses may be utilized to help the Government further define its requirements. If the Government develops a AEST&amp;M project that addresses any submitted or similar topic, the resulting procurement will address technology and business specific requirements as defined by the Government to achieve AEST&amp;M objectives.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Acting upon a request from Congress, the Department of Defense is charged with developing a multi-year roadmap to (1) develop advanced energy storage technologies, and (2) sustain domestic advanced energy storage technology manufacturing capabilities and an assured supply chain necessary to ensure that the Department of Defense has assured access to advanced energy storage technologies to support current military requirements and emerging military needs.</p>
<p>"Advanced Energy Storage" refers to "storage" only and does not include "energy generation". This RFI is intended to include man-portable, mobile/vehicle, and installation-level technologies and manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p>Note that for purposes of this RFI, both domestic and foreign sources of manufacturing may be identified in addressing current or near-term capabilities. For development of the roadmap to achieve an assured supply chain, the AEST&amp;M effort will only address domestic sources of supply and demand. The AEST&amp;M anticipates defining domestic source to be a business concern that performs in the United States or Canada substantially all of the research and development, engineering, manufacturing, and production activities required of such business concern under a contract with the United States relating to a critical component or a critical technology item and that procures from such concerns substantially all of any components and assemblies required under a contract with the United States relating to a critical component or critical technology item. (This definition is used within the Defense Production Act Title III Program.)</p>
<p>While the focus of this RFI is on DoD-related systems and requirements, it is very appropriate to address technologies that also have application in the commercial/public markets. Technologies that have commercial use can drastically reduce the price and improve the availability of advanced capabilities to the DoD. An obvious example would be hybrid battery technologies for commercial automobiles and trucks that might be used also by military vehicles, even with some minor differences. For the demand information sought below, responders are encouraged to show how commercial demand and production can have benefits to DoD.</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED RESPONSES</p>
<p>Limit RFI responses to 20 pages. Responses must be unclassified and contain no proprietary information. Note: See Format and Page Limitations and Submission of Documentation paragraphs for additional instructions. Responses are preferred in the following format:</p>
<p>TITLE: Name of the recommended AEST&amp;M project.</p>
<p>SUBMITTER INFORMATION: Responses should include the company name, location of research, development, or planned production facilities, and the title, telephone number, and mail and e-mail addresses of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss the submission.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS/INTERESTED ORGANIZATIONS: Identify the government customer organizations or suggested other government organizations cognizant of the technology/production issues and challenges. This should be the organizations/agencies that have the technical or programmatic expertise for assessing the values of the project to potential government customers. Identify the appropriate government programs (and/or point of contact), including organization, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone and FAX numbers. Points of contact that can provide additional information useful to the project review should be included in an Appendix. (Pages in the Appendix do not count in the page limitation.)</p>
<p>Letters from current or potential government customers expressing an interest in addressing the challenges are encouraged. Such letters may be included in the Appendix, again without impacting the page limitation.</p>
<p>PROJECT NEED: This section provides essential background information on the technology. It addresses the technology's importance to national defense and the need for inclusion in the AEST&amp;M Roadmap. This section should include at least the following:</p>
<p>1. Technology Description. The technology and its current and future uses.<br />2. Benefits. The advantages of the proposed technology over existing technologies and substitutes in terms of cost, performance, and other factors. Cite specific benefits to the national defense and/or the national economy of creating production capacity for the proposed technology.<br />3. Problem Statement. The nature of the problem (e.g., obsolete storage capacity, lack of production-scale capability, need for lower cost item), its impact on defense capabilities, and any other considerations that increase the need for the project. <br />4. Essentiality of Government Assistance. Address the following to support the need for potential DoD investment:<br />a. The expansion of capacity, the development of a technological process, or the production of materials is essential to the national defense; and<br />b. United States industry on its own cannot reasonably be expected to provide the needed capacity, technological processes, or materials in a timely manner.</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY MATURITY: The roadmap development effort seeks to examine relatively mature technologies that reasonably can be expected to achieve true manufacturing capability by the end of government fiscal year 2015, 30 September 2015. Therefore, responders should include in their discussion supporting evidence that their technology has achieved Technology Readiness Level 7 (System prototype demonstration in an operational environment) with a path to achieve Level 9 (system proven through successful mission operations) by 30 September 2015.</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY DEMAND: A primary requirement of AEST&amp;M is that commercial clearly identified military demand for a technology must exist and be foreseeable within the period described above. This section describes, in as much detail as possible, current and future demand for the technology. It should include:</p>
<p>1. Projected DoD demand during the next seven years. Cite demand by item of equipment and material quantities and types, for existing and new programs. Be sure to indicate which military departments require the technology.<br />2. Projected commercial demand (if applicable) for the same period. Be as specific as possible about technology applications.</p>
<p>INDUSTRY CAPABILITIES: This section describes industry's current and expected capability to develop or produce the technology. It should include:</p>
<p>1. Domestic U.S. and worldwide production sources. Current and planned capabilities and capacity for specific firms, as available. Note current DoD sources of supply. Estimated quantity of material to be produced over the next seven years (with and without AEST&amp;M assistance). <br />2. Market dynamics. Explain how competition and other market factors have affected domestic industrial capabilities. Cite market shares and trends, if possible.<br />3. Constraints. Factors affecting industry's ability and willingness to meet DoD demand without AEST&amp;M incentives.</p>
<p>RISKS: Include a discussion of technical and business risks and issues that must be addressed and resolved (or accepted) before the DoD will have an assured supply chain.</p>
<p>1. Business Risks. Include an assessment of the time and cost to bring the new capacity on-line and the product is competitiveness with other sources (domestic or foreign) or with alternative technologies. Address all factors that would affect the sale of this technology and the long-term viability of the source. <br />2. Technical Uncertainties. Include requirements for new processes, significant scale-up of existing technologies, remaining development risks, product qualification requirements, and technology and manufacturing readiness.</p>
<p>PROJECT CONCEPT: Although the Program Office would structure any approved project, an initial concept is required to support understanding of the recommended project.<br />1. Technical approach. State recommended project's technical objectives and outline the technical approach. Identify what the proposed project would accomplish and how. Describe what work and investments would be necessary to increase the production capacity, increase yields, decrease costs, etc. Identify needed major equipment purchases or upgrades to existing equipment. Include a time-phased plan for major elements of the approach.<br />2. Business approach. State the proposed business case for the project. Identify current and future markets including customers, projected revenues, employee growth, and market share (include U.S. and world markets). State total investment needed, sources for the investment (own company, AEST&amp;M funds, other government sources, etc.). Estimate the amount of investment industry would be likely/able to make in this project. <br />3. Cost/Funding Estimates. Provide a top-level breakdown of estimated project costs. Identify recommended type of AEST&amp;M incentive to be used, e.g., production scale-up, engineering costs, equipment purchase costs, business development costs, process optimization, samples and qualification costs, or purchase commitments, etc.</p>

<DESC>Notice of intent to extend a commercial service contract on a sole source basis. The US Naval Hospital Guam intends to extend a firm-fixed price, personal service contract with Dr Elisabeth Carr, Pulmonologist, located in the Internal Medicine Department. This notice is a sole source extension of an existing contract, number N68096-09-M-8659. The Government intends to extend/modify the current contract for two (2) months, commencing March 31, 2009 through May 31, 2009. The current performance period expires on March 30, 2009. It is not in the Governments best interest to compete this short two month requirement. Award to another source at this point would cost the Government time, duplication of cost, and un-acceptable delays in fulfilling the requirement. For this short term effort, the only responsible source who can provide these services without substantial duplication of cost and un-acceptable risk to patient care is Dr Elisabeth Carr, the incumbent contractor. Dr Carr is presently performing this contract and is the only known source capable of performing at the current levels while maintaining continuity of patient care (services) through May 31, 2009. This notice required by FAR 5.201 will be published by March 26, 2009, and any inquiries or proposals received shall be considered.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Roche Diagnostic Corporation, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46250-0457. A purchase order will be issued for software updates, preventative maintenance, and on-site repair of the following U.S. Government owned laboratory equipment: Nomenclature: DNA Genome Sequencer; Model Number: GS-FLX; Equipment ID&nbsp;Number: 03070155.<br />The commercial services are being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, to exclude FAR Part 13.5. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b).The period of performance will not exceed one calendar year. The place of performance is CDC / NCPDCID Division of Scientific Resources, Atlanta, Georgia, Roybal Campus, Bldg. 1, Room SB245. The justification for other than full and open competition is considered as it is believed that Roache Diagnostics Corp. is the only vender capable of maintaining this patented laboratory equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. It is further believed that all software upgrades are the intellectual property of Roache Diagnostics Corp., and can only be installed by an authorized Roach technician. The equipment is currently under manufacturer warranty, but there is a continued need to maintain serviceability of this DNA Sequencer once the warranty has expired. The manufactures' warranty will expire in the next 30 days, and the equipment must remain serviceable for on-going research being conducted by the CDC. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the specified maintenance services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquires may be sent to Russell T. Oxford by e-mail at roxford@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2044.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VISN 6 Centralized Acquisition Service, intends to negotiate Sole Source procurement with Baxter Healthcare for inpatient and outpatient hemodialysis supplies for patients serviced by the VA Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.  This proposed contract action is for the peritoneal dialysis fluid, Icodextrin, as well as other fluids, kidneys, and supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 603.2.  The VA believes that Baxter Healthcare is the only company that can provide Icodextrin.  Contract award will be made on all or none basis in order to maintain consistency for both home and inpatient use.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements for Icodextrin.  Information may be sent to the Contracting Officer, Pat Easter, 201 Hay Street, Suite 304, Fayetteville, NC 28301.  Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with the Sole Source negotiation with Baxter Healthcare.

<DESC><p>This notice announces a decision by the Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) regarding FPI's production of two products within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 8415: (1) IPFU Pants &amp; Jackets; and (2) T-Shirts, IPFU Long Sleeve.</p>
<p>A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product's expansion threshold in cases of public exigency, such as a national defense emergency. The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from the Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked. Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that "increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur."</p>
<p>On March 16, 2009, FPI received a request from the Defense Supply Center of Philadelphia to temporarily increase production of IPFU items to support DoD requirements that have to be filled prior to the end of fiscal year 2009. The request would result in exceeding the previous exigency requested levels for the IPFU items by an estimated $3 million. The impact of FPI manufacturing the requested items would be as follows:</p>
<p>IPFU Pants would increase from current levels to 36,000 units per month for the balance of the fiscal year. Total Sales would exceed the previous exigency requested levels ($17.8 million) by approximately $3 million for IPFU pants &amp; jackets.</p>
<p>IPFU T-shirts, long sleeve would increase from its current level to 75,000 units per month for the balance of the fiscal year. These additional units may cause FPI to exceed the previously authorized exigency level of 4 million units, yet FPI does not expect the unit increase to exceed the current exigency sales level for IPFU T-shirts of $24.5 million.</p>
<p>FPI presented its Board of Directors with a request to invoke the guidelines' "national exigency" provision. In light of the military's critical need for this item, FPI staff requested its Board to invoke the "national exigency" provision for FSC code 8415, specifically <a name="BM_1_"></a>IPFUs ( jackets and pants) and T-Shirts, Long Sleeve. On March 20, 2009, FPI's Board of Directors officially approved this request. Accordingly, FPI's sales in IPFU (pants and jackets) and units in IPFU T-shirts may temporarily exceed the guidelines ceiling without constituting a guidelines violation.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the national exigency provision of FPI's guidelines is temporary. It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher sales level as a future production baseline. For this request, the increase in production levels will be maintained only for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2009.</p>
<p>Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI's Board of Directors. Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, DC 20534. Attention: FPI Board of Directors.</p>

The majority of hydrogen produced today is from natural gas, heavy oils, and coal.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Biological production technologies show promise for true renewable biohydrogen from biomass. Breakthroughs in biological hydrogen production have been due to genetic engineering of microorganisms for conversion of glucose through both biophotolysis and fermentation; the latter is dependent on hydrogenase enzymes enabling reduction of protons to produce hydrogen. When isolated and used in solution, higher production yields are achieved through tunable reaction conditions and elimination of competing cellular processes that inhibit hydrogen conversion. These processes though suffer from difficult isolation protocols and oxygen sensitivity of soluble hydrogenase enzymes.</span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Analysis & Design Application Co. ltd. (CD-adapco) for the use of the STAR-CCM+ network license. The period of performance for this service will consist of one base year and three one-year options.  NRC staff is responsible for conducting safety assessments on radioactive material and spent nuclear fuel storage cask and transportation designs.  Specifically, the staff must look at heat transfer and gas flow for cask, canister, and package designs in order to determine the thermal performance envelope for designs and to determine if the designs meet the applicable NRC regulations.  STAR-CCM+ is an engineering process oriented computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool that delivers the latest CFD technology in a single integrated environment and is one of the tools the staff uses to analyze the thermal effects of loading, transfer, transportation and accident scenarios on these designs prior to certification. In order to maintain the staffs current CFD analysis tools for review of spent nuclear fuel storage casks and radioactive material packages and to fully utilize the analysis resources available, the NRC staff must maintain a current license of the STAR-CCM+ software.  Without the license to Star CCM + software, the NRC would not be able to review or modify analyses that are submitted in the Star CCM+ code.  This would inhibit NRCs ability to conduct independent confirmatory analyses.

The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis with CD-adapco is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511.  This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRCs needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address not later than 10 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.

Inc., 98-820 Moanalua Rd, Aiea, HI 96701, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice is not a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers.

<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302&#8208;1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements (ref. 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).<br />(1) Contracting Activity: Department of the Air Force, 15th Contracting Squadron, Specialized Flight (15 CONS/LGCZ), 90 G Street, Building 1201, Hickam AFB, HI 96853&#8208;5230.<br />(2) Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved: Justification for procurement of SMART technology wireless audio visual equipment from the Audio Visual Company (AVCO).<br />(3) Description of Services required to Meet the Agency's Needs:The Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS) requires a wireless technology&#8208;based solution for integration of SMART board educational technology for their conference rooms. The APCSS has a requirement to maximize their instructor flexibility in the APCSS complex by providing a wireless matrix&#8208;switcher system, allowing instructors to operate the SMART Board interactive whiteboards remotely within each of their respective classrooms and conference rooms. The estimated value of the SMART technology equipment will not be disclosed for competition purposes but is under $550,000.00. <br />(4) Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: In accordance with 10 U.S.C., 2304(c) (1) - There is only one responsible source from which the requirement can be met. The head of an agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures when the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.<br />Use of the SMART technology for the APCSS is essential, to ensure compatibility with existing SMART technology components throughout the APCSS complex. SMART Technologies, Inc. is a private company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with authorized dealers across North America. As the only manufacturer, SMART Technologies, Inc. has one source from which to procure SMART technology for the Pacific Region, in the State of Hawaii, which is the Audio Visual Company (AVCO). No other sources are available in Hawaii.<br />(5) Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires use of the Authority Cited: The Audio Visual Company (AVCO) is the only authorized supplier of items manufactured by SMART Technologies, Inc., for the State of Hawaii and the Pacific Region. The APCSS has already invested over $420,000.00 in outfitting their classrooms with SMART Board interactive<br />Page 2 of 3<br />whiteboards. There is no other similar wireless technology compatible, nor any other source from which to procure.<br />(6) Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as deemed Practicable: A solicitation for SMART Board interactive whiteboards was issued in July 2008 and competition was solicited. As a result, the 15th Contracting Squadron was informed that local businesses on the island of Oahu, initially interested in submitting price quotes for SMART technology items, sought wholesale pricing from regional suppliers on the continental U.S. (CONUS). Once the regional suppliers from CONUS found out items were for Hawaii, they referred them to the Audio Visual Company located on Oahu. Attempts to solicit offers from as many sources as available proved impossible (reference RFP#DHAM80023, dated 14 Jul 2008). Only one source is available on the island of Oahu.<br />(7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: In accordance with FAR 13.106&#8208;3, if only one offer is received, the Contracting Officer will include in the contract file a statement of price reasonableness. The statement may be based on market research, comparison of proposed prices with prices found reasonable on previous purchases; current price lists; comparison with similar items in a related industry, comparison to an independent government estimate, or any other reasonable basis.<br />(8) Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results: The Contracting Officer conducted market research and discovered that a local business on the island of Oahu, initially interested in submitting price quotes for SMART Technology equipment items, sought wholesale pricing from regional suppliers on the mainland U.S. This local business informed the Government that he was not able to submit a price quote because once the regional suppliers found out items were to be shipped to Hawaii; they were instead referred to the Audio Visual Company located on Oahu. For previous SMART Technology equipment purchases, attempts to solicit offers from as many sources proved impossible (reference RFP#DHAM80023, dated 14 Jul 2008). Market research has revealed that only one source is available on the island of Oahu.<br />(9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: As delineated herein, the Audio Visual Company (AVCO) is the only authorized supplier of items manufactured by SMART Technologies, Inc., for the State of Hawaii and the Pacific region.<br />(10) A Listing of the Sources, if any that Expressed in Writing an Interest in the Acquisition: From a recent acquisition of the same equipment (FA5215&#8208;08&#8208;M&#8208;7065), two small businesses operating on the island, Pelatron, Inc. and Laser Barcode Systems, were interested in the acquisition. These two companies were precluded from submitting a price quote because they can only purchase products from the manufacturer's exclusive supplier in Hawaii, which is the Audio Visual Company (AVCO), and AVCO will not team with any other company on the island to provide the items.<br />(11) A Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any barriers to Competition Before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Services Required: The Agency will continue to monitor the marketplace and inquire if other suppliers of SMART technology become available.<br />Page 3 of 3<br />(12) Technical and Requirements Certification: based on the aforementioned, I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification, are complete and accurate, to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />_____________________________________________________________<br />NAME AND TITLE OF TECHNICAL EVALUATION Date Mr. Brad Ong, Technical Support Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS)<br />(13) Contracting Officer Certification: IAW FAR 6.3030&#8208;2(a)(12), I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of Other than Full and Open Competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />_______________________________________________________________<br />DARRELL L. STRAHAN Date Contracting Officer<br />APPROVAL<br />In accordance with AFFARS 5306.304, I hereby approve this justification to permit other than full and open competition, and support the recommended award to the Audio Visual Company, as there is no other reseller authorized to sell SMART Technology products in the state of Hawaii and the pacific Region.<br />________________________________________________________________<br />RODGER W.

<p>Justification &amp; Approval<br />Limited Source<br />Knoll Component Furniture for<br />Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies<br />23 March 2009</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c), an acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited (10 USC, 2304 (c)(5)).<br />(1) Contracting Activity: Department of the Air Force, 15th Contracting Squadron, Specialized Flight (15 CONS/LGCZ), 90 G Street, Building 1201, Hickam AFB, Hawaii 96853.<br />(2) Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved: Justification for band name purchase for Knoll furniture components for the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS).<br />(3) Description of Services Required Meeting the Agency's Needs: APCSS requires additional furniture components to complete the outfitting of its workspace. The additional furniture components need to be able to: (a) integrate into the existing Knoll furniture, (b) allow for flexibility when workstations are rearranged and (c) match the current furniture in appearance. The estimated value will not be disclosed for competition purposes but is less than $550,000.00 <br />(4) Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: IAW 10 USC, 2304(c) (1) - only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. The acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program IAW Title III of Federal Property and Administrative Services Act &amp; Title 40 USC, 501, Services for Executive agencies. IAW FAR 8.405-6(a)(2) - Item peculiar to one manufacturer and feature is essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's need.<br />(5) Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: FAR 6.302-1(c) provides for use of brand name descriptions when the requirement can only be met by one brand name product. Knoll is the only manufacturer of the furniture components utilized in the workspace. Utilizing another manufacturer's components would require all of the workspace furniture to be replaced. Use of non-compatible components could cause a safety problem.<br />The additional systems furniture, including all component parts, will be integrated with existing workstations that were built using Knoll components previously purchased. The new systems furniture is to be located adjacent to and comingled with existing Knoll systems and needs to provide a semblance of cohesion by matching with co-sharing panels. The additional furniture components need to be able to: (a) integrate into the existing Knoll furniture, (b) allow for flexibility when workstations are rearranged and (c) match the current furniture in appearance. <br />(6) Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable: IAW FAR 5.202(a)(6), this acquisition will be ordered against an existing IDIQ contract under a GSA schedule and no other offers will be solicited for this requirement. IAW FAR 8.404(a), placing orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of 8.405, ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement. There is only one authorized reseller of Knoll furniture in Hawaii, and that is Corporate Environments International (CEI), a small business. However since Knoll furniture is the schedule holder, CEI will be indentified in the award, but the award will be to Knoll furniture.<br />(7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The requirement items/services are commercially available therefore existing market forces support the cost reasonableness determination. The prices quoted are based on GSA contract GS-28F-8029H. Per FAR 8.404(d) GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. <br />(8) Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results: Market research was conducted by reviewing the Federal Supply Schedules. Market research indicates that the Knoll component furniture is unique and not compatible with other systems furniture. The Knoll manufacturer is the only source available to purchase the furniture components from. It was determined that no other FSS vendor has furniture on schedule that matches, has interconnectivity to, and is compatible with the existing Knoll systems furniture.<br />This requirement is not available for "full and open competition" based on the need for Knoll brand furniture. Additionally, there is only one reseller for any Knoll furniture purchased in Hawaii, and that is by purchasing the furniture through the Knoll GSA schedule. A search on GSA Advantage did show the items being requested with the prices for these items the same as advertised on GSA. If a contract is awarded to another source other than Knoll, more cost would be needlessly added to the Government to purchase replacement furniture because other than Knoll furniture components would not interconnect with the Knoll furniture.<br />(9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: The use of Knoll furniture components is essential to APCSS's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. Acquisition of a different brand would cause incompatibility with the existing component furniture.<br />(10) A Listing of the Sources, if any that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A<br />(11) A Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition Before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Services Required: It is the policy of this office to solicit for full and open competition to the fullest extent possible on all procurements. The specific requirements can only be met in this situation by using other than full and open competition.<br />(12) Technical and Requirements Certification: Based on the aforementioned, I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.<br />ROBERT M. HOGAN Date APCSS Facilities Branch<br />(13) Contracting Officer Certification: IAW FAR 8.405-6(g)(2)(ix), I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of Other Than Full and Open Competition are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />DARRELL L. STRAHAN Date Contracting Officer, 15 CONS/LGCZ<br />Approval<br />In accordance with AFFARS 5306.304, I hereby approve justification to permit other than full and open competition for Knoll furniture components for APCSS.<br />ROGER W. PHILLIPS, Lt Col, USAF Date Commander, 15th Contracting Squadron</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source contract to Planning Systems, Incorporated to analyze for accuracy, digitize, declassify and prepare for release hydrographic/bathymetric data collected during 13 operational/research deployments by US and UK Navy nuclear submarines under the cover of Arctic Ocean sea ice.  The effort to analyze, digitize, declassify and prepare for release this data, which is classified secret, requires the uniquely knowledgeable individuals sought for this effort.  They must possess appropriate security clearances and access to the data repository at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).  They must have in-depth knowledge of the capabilities of nuclear submarines and their operation under sea ice; understand the Arctic Ocean sea ice environment; must be sensitive to the acoustic anomalies of the area and how they may affect the performance and security modes set on the sonar equipment used during collection; and must know the fundamental bathymetric character of the ocean area to enable individual data points to be validated for accuracy.  An understanding of the various modes, accuracies, and uses of submarine navigation equipment is needed to correlate the digitized data to a specific location and ultimately to confirm accuracy.  The data is currently stored and must be worked on in a classified, special compartment at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, for which individuals with the required knowledge at Planning System, Incorporated has access.  However if any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated, however a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a firm-fixed price contract to Planning Systems, Incorporated.  Point of contact for this procurement is Lisa L. Kurtz at lisa.l.kurtz@usace.army.mil

VA will require proof from the vendors that the FDA issues have been resolved.  A letter to the vendor from the regulatory agency will meet this requirement.  Vendors must include the letters with their proposals.Items involved in a recall cannot be identified items for Award Group One Sub Groups A & B. and cannot be added onto any resultant contract until the recall is resolved.     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) (Tailored) The Government may award up to three fixed price contracts with economic price adjustments resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in descending order of importance.  The non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.      1.  Technical.  For Award Group A the technical evaluation will be based on the top item in each sub group A & B and related leads identified per the Instructions to Offerors.  Each item will be scored individually.  For each factor, if the factor is present, all of the points are awarded.  If the factor is not present, none of the points will be awarded.  However, six factors are rated according to maximum delivered energy, charge time at ERI, information management, duration or longevity, Battery Life and LV delivery systems.  In weighting these factors the government has determined the clinical relevance of the listed features.  The scores for sub group A & B and related leads will be added together.  No additional points are going to be given to products that exceed the requirements as defined in the evaluation matrices.  When selecting the "top of the line" model to be submitted for evaluation, select those that best meet the needs of VA as defined by the matrices.   2.  Price.  There will be two levels of price analysis.  The first analysis will be a comparative analysis of the prices offered for all items being technically evaluated.  The second level will be for all other items included in the offer.   For these items, price analysis of the discounts offered to the Government will be based on price reasonableness of prices offered using commercial sales practices information.  See Proposal Organization.      3.  Quality/Past Performance.  The Government shall evaluate the Offeror's reputation for quality and past performance.  By quality and past performance the Government means the Offeror's record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship (effort and/or endeavor); the contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the contractor's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; the contractor's record of integrity and business ethics, and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government shall evaluate quality/past performance on the basis of information that may be obtained from the Offeror, or from any other source such as previous commercial and Government contracts (See Attachment A).  The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (See Clause AS3029).    4.  Small Disadvantage Business (SDB) Participation.  Evaluation of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation will be a subjective assessment based on the offeror's SDB Participation Targets (expressed as dollars and percentages of the total value of the offer) and the extent to which the SDBs are specifically identified in the offeror's proposal.        (b) Options. (Tailored)  Option year prices will be evaluated using EPA procedures outlined in AS Clause 1515.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).    (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.                          TECHNICAL EVALUATION FOR CRT-D (WITH DEFIBRILLATION) AND CRT-P (WITHOUT DEFIBRILLATION)1a. Technical Evaluation for CRT-D Sub Group A.  An evaluation of the offered cardiac resynchronization therapy devices with and/or without defibrillation (CRT-D & CRT-P) will be performed by the CRT Technical Evaluation Team. Products will be evaluated by the presence or absence of each factor, weighed according to its clinical importance, listed below in each product line. A vendor having most of the clinically important features will receive an overall favorable technical evaluation..Evaluation Factor 						                        Clinical Importance

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the<br />effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.</p>
<p>7. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE <br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a) (2) below); or <br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a) (2) below).</p>
<p>(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure. Modified as of 10 Sept 07</p>
<p>b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.</p>
<p>c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include<br />(1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.</p>
<p>d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to<br />the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.</p>
<p>e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause.<br />he NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided<br />by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>9. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as Request for Proposal (RFP) # NLRB-PAR-2009, when responding to this notice.  This is a total Small Business Set Aside; NAICS Code: 541430, Small Business Size Standard: $7.0 million.  This RFP will result in the award of a Firm Fixed Price contract for design, layout, and editing of the National Labor Relations Boards, Performance and Accountability Report.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31, effective March 19, 2009.

GENERAL INFORMATION

A.  Introduction

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and the Accountability for Tax Dollars Act of 2002 require that the NLRB prepare an annual Performance and Accountability Report (PAR).  The audience for this publication is the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, other federal agencies, and the public.

The NLRB requires contractor assistance in preparing this publication in the form of design, layout, and editing.

B.  Background

The PAR follows form and content guidance prescribed in OMB Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements.  It is due to OMB and Congress by November 15 of each year.  The intent of the PAR is to provide an accurate depiction of the Agency's performance in meeting its strategic goals, and to present its year-end financial statements as of September 30th, and the results of an accompanying audit. 

To prepare the PAR, the NLRB's Director of Administration works with representatives of the NLRB's program offices to develop narrative text, tables, and graphics.  Microsoft Office templates (primarily Microsoft Word) are distributed to program staff.  This initiates the collection and assembly of the PAR.  Typically, the publication goes through multiple iterations.  This information is combined with general background information about the NLRB.  On or about the week of October 26, the financial management section, which is dependent on the completion of the financial statement audit, is inserted into the publication.  Because of the nature of this project, products, drafts and final, will have to be completed within a short turnaround time.
 

C.  Description

The Agency seeks to use a contractor that provides design, layout, and editing services to reduce the amount of time to produce the publication, while increasing the document's overall quality.

The base requirement of this contract is for the contractor to produce the NLRB's FY 2009 PAR.  The NLRB contemplates awarding a contract for a Base Term and four 1 - year options.  The services to be performed by the contractor in the option years, should one or more be exercised, are identified below:

	Option Year I		-	2010 Performance and Accountability Report
	Option Year II		-	2011 Performance and Accountability Report
	Option Year III		-	2012 Performance and Accountability Report
	Option Year IV		-	2013 Performance and Accountability Report

The following information is being provided to assist with preparing a firm fixed price proposal.

	Statistics on FY 2008 PAR Document, and Estimate for FY 2009 PAR Needs

The following is a list of specifications on the NLRB's FY 2008 PAR (created in Microsoft Word):

	7 Photographs (excluding the cover);
	3 .pdf files (Inspector Generals Report, Independent Auditors Report, Inspector General's Top Management Challenges);
	38 Charts, Tables, and Graphs (including Financial Statements); and
	96 page report (front/back).

The NLRB's FY 2008 PAR may be found using the following Internet address: 

http://www.nlrb.gov/publications/reports/performance_and_accountability_report_-_FY_2008.aspx

The successful contractor shall satisfy the following requirements for the FY 2009 PAR:

Editing
	Review 100-125 pages of text for grammatical errors, etc. (NLRB staff will review for content); and 
	Technical review of proofs (e.g., missing fonts, bleeds, size, correct color modes, resolution, binding, etc.).

Graphic Design
	Design cover (new design);
	Change color scheme;
	Design and prepare charts, tables, and graphs;
	Insert text; and
	Headings, table of contents, and glossary.

Production
	.pdf version for Web posting;
	Final production files

D.  Work Requirements

The contractor shall perform the following tasks.

1.  Meetings / Communications

The contractor shall meet with the COTR and NLRB staff to coordinate an exact work / production process including interim and final production dates.  The contractors adherence to the interim and final production dates shall be considered a requirement of the contract.  Since ongoing communication is paramount in producing the PAR, the contractor shall meet twice monthly with the COTR and NLRB staff to complete the production of the document.  However, the COTR may increase or decrease the frequency of the meetings.

Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one vendors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by the brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Governments existing investiment. The rationale for this brand name only justification is based on several factors.  A foundational consideration is that the nature of performance testing technology is highly specialized, requiring a significant investment in staffing and training in any giving product. While there are competing products that have similar functionality, the knowledge and expertise to use each system is not easily transferable. The cost in training, experience and project dalay would be significant and far outweigh any potential savings to the government.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Thisd is not a formal RFQ but for information only.Research Testing DivisionNew Inexpensive Xenon Recycling MethodOne of GRCs contributions to the Science Mission Directorate involves testing in largeand small vacuum facilities.   A significant portion of this testing is associated within-space propulsion systems such as ion engines.  Many of the ion engines use a heavy gassuch as Xenon as the propellant.  In recent years the cost of Xenon has increasedsignificantly (from $3/liter to as high as $45/liter).	This rapid increase in cost hasplaced heavy burdens on the programs developing this technology.  One example is the NEXTprogram testing in GRCs large Vacuum Tank VF-16.  This test alone uses approximately30,000 liters of Xenon per year.  The tenfold price increase for Xenon would increase thecost of NEXT testing VF-16 in the range of $1M each year.  To alleviate much of this costincrease, the Testing Division staff has developed an efficient and inexpensive Xenonrecycling method that will recoup 75% of the cost of the Xenon.Xenon recycling has been talked about and attempted before at GRC.  Commercial turnkeysystems for collecting Xenon from exhaust gases are available and one was purchased abouttwenty years ago and installed in vacuum facility VF05 in building 301.  This system usedliquid nitrogen to freeze out the Xenon from the exhaust stream.  The system proved to bedifficult to operate and the amount of Xenon recovered was not enough to continue itsoperation. The new approach incorporated for the first time in the VF-16 facility is simple and veryinexpensive.  The Xenon gas from the ion engine is captured in the vacuum facility bycryo pumps.  About once a month the VF-16 facility is regenerated by warming up the cyropumps to boil off the Xenon. Until November 2008, this Xenon was rough pumped out thevent to the atmosphere.  Now as the cryo pumps warm up the Xenon is pumped into a large(2000 gal.) polyester bag.  This pumping of the Xenon to the bag occurs at nearly ambientpressure so there are no special precautions required. The collected Xenon is recompressed into the same K bottles it came in from the supplierso that is can be shipped back for recycling.  Initially this was accomplished using thefacilities and expertise of the Microgravity Science Divisions GRC Gas Mixing Facilitylocated in building 333, annex.  As the process is matured a dedicated suitablecompressor cart will be built.	Spectra Gases Inc. which supplies the research grade Xenon has tentatively agree toprovide a 75% credit of all Xenon returned toward the purchase of research grade Xenon.  On November 21, 2008 approximately 1900 liters of used Xenon was transported frombuilding 16 to the gas lab in building 333, annex in a 500 gallon little gas bag.  Thisgas was pumped into a K bottle and is ready to ship to Spectra Gases Inc. This concept is being expanded to vacuum facilities VF05 and VF07.  VF05 recently startedanother test for the NEXT program which will use an estimated 7,300 liters of Xenon. When this test concludes in March 2009 the new system will be used to capture the usedXenon.	VF07 is being prepared for a two year life test of a Hall thruster.  This testing shouldstart in April 2009.  It is estimated that this test will use 20,000 liters of Xenon peryear for two years.  Significance: On a yearly basis the consumption for just the three tests mentioned worksout to about  57,000 liters of Xenon per year.	To procure replacement Xenon gas atcurrent market price of $30 per liter would take about $1.7M.  A significant portion ofthe Xenon gas used in testing can be collected using this simple concept.  This gas canbe returned for recycling resulting in a cost savings to the government.  It is tempting to claim a 75% cost savings but the reality is that none of the NASAprograms budgeted for the tenfold increase in the price of Xenon.  Without a recyclingprogram GRC research programs would need a significant additional amount of money to buyXenon or would be forced to stop testing when the current supply runs out.  1	what trade in allowance will you give us toward the purchase of your "in stock"99,9995 xenon?2	what would you charge us to clean up our xenon back to 99.9995 and return to us?Respond to:  Thomas J Sours, NASA GLenn Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Rd.,  ClevelandOhio  44135-3191orThomas.J.Sours@nasa.govPoints of Contact: FTF/Tom Sours (216) 433-3803, FTF/Mike Swiatek (216) 433-2720 andZIN/David VanZandt (440) 625-2308

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 12.6, using simplified acquisition procedures under the test program for commercial items found at FAR 13.5, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. This combined synopsis/solicitation shall be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (http://www.neco.navy.mil/). The RFP number is N00244-09-R-0033.  This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-27 and DFARS Change Notice 20081112. It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: http://www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm.  The NAICS code ! is 334516. 
The Government has a requirement for the HR Interferometer Laser system to be used to calibrate the Electro-Optic Variant of the Virtual Instrument Portable Electronic Repair/Test System (VIPER/T), AN/USM-717 .  
All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item
CLIN 0001-  HR Interferometer system  - (Quantity of 3 each) meeting all of the  following required specification:
Interferometer Specifications: 
System:	A phase shifting, compact, Twyman- Green interferometer with integrated object-plane focusingMeasuring wavelength:	632.8 nmBeam Shaping Optics:		F/3 Calibration Artifact:		1/20 wave PV (0.03 micron) accuracy Detector/camera Resolution:	1000 x 1000 pixels Laser Source:	Single frequencyStabilized HeNe Fiber and fiber coupling                                                             Maximum radiation output ? 1 mWReturn Flat Assembly:	Precision 10" fused quartz 					1/20 wave PV (0.03 micron) accuracy							Front mounted in Tip/Tilt StageInterferometer Mount:		X, Y, and Z and rotation adjustable mountDimensions:			110 x 45 x 70mm (without Objective)
Dedicated computer system including measurement and analysis softwareOnsite installation and training
TETS System Wavefront Performance establishes the requirements for the above mentioned specifications:
The accuracy of the Interferometer Calibration artifact is 0.05 waves. The tolerance is doubled as a transfer standard. Repeatability of PV measurements is specified as 0.005 waves.
The single pass requirement for the collimator mirror cell is1/6 wave/fringe. The fold mirror tolerance is 1/10 before bonding. These surface area tolerances are  the equivalent wavefront tolerances. The peak-valley single pass wavefront tolerance for the assembled and aligned collimator module is 0.59 waves at a wavelength of 632.8nm. The double pass wavefront error shall be < 1.18 waves. The testing that is being performed basically splits a single incoming beam of light into two identical beams by a grating or a partial mirror. Each of these beams will travel a different route, called a path, before they are recombined at a detector. The path difference, the difference in the distance traveled by each beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves. This could be a physical change in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path.Installation/Training/Warranty1.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up and provide one (1) training session for NSWC personnel at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, 2300 Fifth Street,  Norco, CA 92860.The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.

<a href="mailto:sandra.schuck@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Section 1.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.2 Research & Development as described below. Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements. INTRODUCTION: The Army is anticipating the development of a new centerline turboshaft engine for use in current and Future Force rotorcraft. The Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE) program, a 7000 horsepower class full engine demonstrator, will be conducted under the DOD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program and will consist of a 5 year technical effort beginning in FY12 to demonstrate the VAATE phase III turboshaft/turboprop goal. The FATE program goals will be to demonstrate a reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC), an increase in shaft horsepower to weight ratio, a reduction in production and maintenance cost, and a design life of 6000 hrs in a 7000 hp class turboshaft engine. In order to meet the aggressive goals of the FATE program, significant advancements in compressor technologies will be required to achieve the cycle temperatures and pressure ratios required. These conditions create significant challenges for components in the compressor of the FATE engine. Therefore, the objective of this announcement is to develop and validate critical advanced compressor technologies that improve the performance, durability, and/or affordability of an advanced compressor necessary to enable FATE technology level turboshaft engines. The offeror must substantiate how the proposed technology efforts are critical to their planned FATE configuration. The period of performance for this program is approximately 48 months. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: It is the Government's desire to conduct a technology development effort focused on advanced compressor technologies for FATE technology level turboshaft engines. The program shall utilize a notional FATE turboshaft engine design to establish the operational requirements and potential payoffs of the proposed concepts relative to the FATE engine performance, cost, and durability/life goals. The notional FATE engine should be a free shaft engine and designed to achieve the following goals that are based on a configuration that does not include a reduction gearbox but does include an inlet particle separator: 0.32 Specific Fuel Consumption (based on 7000 SHP engine @ SLS, IRP point); 9.7 Horsepower to Weight ratio @ IRP (7000 shaft horsepower); greater than or equal to 6000 hours design life, 15000 cycles cold parts, 7500 cycles for turbine blades and combustor liners (to crack initiation); 125 $/HP per engine production cost (including control system and IPS); 45% Reduction in maintenance cost in $ per engine flight hour (relative to offerors  proposed baseline); 20% Reduction in development cost (relative to offerors proposed baseline); Efficient operation at part power is desired. Note: For engine level goals: specific fuel consumption, horsepower to weight and life are weighted higher than development, production, and maintenance cost. The offeror shall define the anticipated compressor configuration and performance characteristics consistent with their FATE design. The offeror shall design, fabricate and perform validation testing of the proposed compressor technologies considered critical to their envisioned FATE goal achievement. Validation testing shall be conducted at the bench and/or rig level in an environment that simulates notional FATE engine operational conditions and shall be performed to validate aerodynamic, thermal, and/or mechanical performance. The Advanced Compressor Technology program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE program. Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful offerors, such a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this solicitation. DELIVERABLES: The agreement awarded under this solicitation will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Plan (delivered 45 days after contract award); (2) Design Review Briefing Charts, (3) Test Plans, (4) Quarterly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (5) Final Report, (6) Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis shall be presented. All deliverable data may be in the format of selected recipient. Section II. Award Information: ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Anticipated period of performance is 48 months total with 45 months for the technical effort and an additional 3 months for completion of the final report. The Government funding for the program is $1,900,000 distributed by fiscal year as follows: FY09/10 $600K, FY11 $500K, FY12 $500K, FY13 $300K. TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT: Due to the commercial application of this technology, the Government anticipates an award of a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments. It is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success. TIAs with, to the maximum extent practicable, cost participation of 50% are anticipated because the technology has dual-use potential and performers of the program will benefit from commercialization. Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions. Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R 37. accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r37p.pdf. This BAA will remain open until 2:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight time May 9, 2009. Awards under this announcement are anticipated to be made by August 5, 2009. However, unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals will be considered valid for Government acceptance through March 31, 2010. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received. Further, the Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an offeror's proposal (i.e., certain tasks vs. total program). Multiple proposals from the same offeror that address different solutions or that address only part of the problem under the announcement will be accepted and evaluated independently. Section III. Eligibility Information: Participation in the project announced in this BAA is available to qualified U.S. contractors as prime recipient. The BAA is not set aside for small businesses. Section IV. Application and Submission Information: This BAA contains the total Solicitation. No special application kits/forms/materials are required. GENERAL: The technical proposal should provide a clear justification for the selection of the proposed compressor technology. The justification/rational supporting the proposed technology should be based upon the potential contribution of the proposed technology to the overall achievement of the FATE engine level performance, durability, cost and life goals. The proposal should include a Statement of Work (SOW) that includes the following tasks: 1) Task I  Design; 2) Task II  Fabrication; 3) Task III  Validation Testing; and 4) Task IV  Management and Reporting. The technical proposal should also include a clear statement of the program objectives and the specific approach to be pursued and supporting background experience. It should also contain program milestones, a brief biographical section describing key personnel, a brief description of the facilities/capabilities to be employed in the effort, and a program management section. The offeror will also identify how the proposed propulsion technology is integral to its ongoing efforts to develop or support an ATPP for VAATE. No pre-proposal conference is to be held. The cost proposal shall include the following:  a) A funding profile of cost and man-hours by month totaled by Government fiscal year for each task and the total program; b) Cost at the total program level showing all cost elements by cost category (including applicable rates and factors) by year (calendar or contractor year used to develop proposed rates and factors).  c) Present all costs by cost category by separate individual tasks by Government fiscal year in order to facilitate selection and potential award of individual parts of the proposed effort and d) display cost share for each Government fiscal year. Subcontractor proposals, if applicable, including pricing rate details, should be provided concurrent with the prime contractors submission.  Subcontractor proposals may be provided directly to the Government due to any proprietary nature of the proposal. The cost proposal shall not contain overflow of information suited for the technical proposal.  Any technical information in the cost proposal will not be evaluated.  In the case of any conflict between the two proposals, cost information in the cost proposal will take precedence.   Proposals must be submitted in original and five (5) copies.  You are encouraged to submit cost proposals on electronic media using Microsoft Excel 2007 or compatible. Electronic cost data submission does not relieve the offeror from the responsibility for submission of an original signed hard copy of the cost proposal along with all supporting rationale.  Proposals, excluding the cost section, shall not exceed 30 pages. Page limit is exclusive of title page, section dividers, table of contents, list of figures/tables, glossary of terms and cross-referencing indices which are not considered content pages.

Application Review Information. EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD: The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop an order of merit listing for proposals submitted under this announcement. Evaluation criteria are stated below with the following order of importance: 1) and 2) are equal and significantly more important than 3), 4) and 5) which are equal: (1) The extent to which the proposed component configuration / technologies satisfy the Army research objectives and goals by use of innovative, creative, efficient, and affordable solutions.; (2) The merit of the offerors proposed approach to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives. This includes the reasonableness of the proposed work plan, schedule, and program risk for achieving the program goals /objectives.; (3) The availability, experience and qualifications of the scientists, engineers, technicians, and other proposed personnel. (4) The suitability and availability of proposed facilities; (5) Realism of the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort. Whether costs reflect a clear understanding of the program requirements and are reasonable and consistent with the various elements of the offerors technical proposal. Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art. The amount of cost sharing percentage could result in greater evaluation credit. Cost to the Government is also an important consideration. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: All work performed under resulting agreement(s) will be unclassified and will not require access to classified material. A determination has been made that performance under the agreement (s) will require access to and/or generate technical data the export of which may be restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Section 2751, et. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>This is a notice of EPA's intent to establish up to three (3)&nbsp; Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with vendors to provide audio/visual services for approximately 4 events/year for a period of 3 years. A BPA is not a contract rather it is an agreement containing terms and clauses applying to future orders between the parties during its term, a description of supplies or services to be provided, and methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BPA. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This requirement is set aside for Small Businesses.</p>
<p>The applicable NAIC code is 532490 with a size standard of $7 Million.</p>
<p>Although the BPAs will be established for 3 years, the Government will review the BPAs on a yearly basis in accordance with FAR 13.306-6. BPA Terms and Conditions for this requirement are included in Attachment 1 to these instructions.</p>
<p>The Government will establish BPAs with responsive, responsible offerors. Interested vendors shall submit the following to be considered for a BPA:</p>
<p>1. Brief qualifications statement.<br />2. Contact names and phone numbers of 3-5 references for similar projects.<br />3. An affirmative written statement as to the acceptance of the terms and conditions in Attachment 1.<br />4. Completed Representations and Certifications as prescribed in FAR 52.212-3.</p>
<p>Attachment 2 represents the Government's first anticipated event under a BPA and will be used for pricing in this request for quote. <strong>In order to be considered for the first order, offerors shall submit a firm fixed price quote for the event described in Attachment 2 and a statement of availability for this date and time. </strong></p>

<a href="mailto:keith.waye@va.gov">Contracting Officer E-mail</a>
<DESC>Solicitation VA-241-09-RP-0121 is hereby modified to answer additional questions and to set up a pre-bid conference for April 2, 2009.Q:  You wanted rental costs on 2 LED Signs, but you currently have 3 located in Bldgs. 200, 209 and 248 per Chief of Police at Togus. We filled it in for 2 as was requested. A:  Paragraph on page 1 and in section II should indicate 3. Should be allowance to increase if medical center has additional needs.Q.	Regarding the pricing for the pages. Is the Est. Max Total, supposed to be the "Plan Cost/Unit" multiplied by the highest number in the tier and then multiplied by 12 to calculate the full year? If so, what number would we use in the tier for 301+? A:   I would read it as the monthly cost per device for each quantity: 1st 150 are price A per month, 2nd 150 are price B per month, 3rd 150 are price C per month.Q:  Can you please explain how the alphanumeric pager controllers are being used, and if they are related to any in-house system that you might operate.A:  Alphanumeric paging controllers are to be used solely to communicate to the contractor paging system. There is no connection to any VA device. Connections would be made to the VA network port and a VA telephone port. 	Q:  Can you please elaborate on the VA Internet Gateway mentioned in Section B.  Do you have a direct telephone line or circuit to your present provider?  How are you alphanumeric pages sent presently? A:  The VA Internet Gateway is accessible via the medical center Local Area Network CAT 5 cable connection. The VA Internet Gateway is managed external to the medical center and can be disabled without warning, this requires an automatic transfer to a telephone line if the VA Internet Gateway is unavailable. The current configuration with the present provider is via a non direct dial up telephone line and contractor provided paging controller. Alphanumeric pages are entered into the contractor provided paging controller manually by VA staff and then sent over the telephone line to the contractor paging system.Q:   Page 5, second paragraph explain the controllers using the VA internet with an automatic dial back up.  There is a cost due to the special equipment needed to the automatic dial back up feature and there is no place to put the cost into the RFP. There is also some extensive wiring that would need to take place between he various Togus buildings - is Togus employees going to do that work or contractor?   Where would you like to me to put that cost for the equipment?  Do I need to address the wiring issue?A:   In section II, lines 8, 16, 24, 32 and 39 are the sections to enter monthly costs associated with the paging controller. VA will provide a network connection to the VA internet gateway and a telephone at each location. Equipment at each location should be stand alone with no other  interconnection provided or required by VA. Q:  There is also a lot less expensive and easier way to send alphanumeric messages if we are allowed to use the internet thru the VA Gateway.  Should we discuss that in the RFP? A:  Provisions must be made for an automatic transfer to a standard telephone line for the contractor paging terminal to the contractor paging system. The VA Internet Gateway can be inoperable without warning, the transfer must be automatic. All VA Security issues concerning the use of the VA Internet Gateway must also be addressed. Q:   Page 5, Paragraph 3, Maine toll free pager numbers are allowed 250 calls per month with .10/overcall, OR we can offer you Augusta local pager number with unlimited paging per month - how do you recommend I put this in the RFP?  Currently you have Maine toll free pager numbers.  You get overcalls on 6 pagers each month - we can change these specific pagers to local Augusta numbers so they have unlimited paging and save Togus money.  Again how do I put that in the RFP?A:  We are looking for an all inclusive rate for paging services.  You can provide a pricing plan for 1-800 numbers or local numbers, but the pricing will be all inclusive for unlimited pages.  There should not be any charges for overcalls. Q:  Safety chains for pagers.  We can give you about 200 of these but then we are out of them.  There is no paging manufacturer that is supplying them currently.A:  If there are no companies that can offer safety chains or a limited quantity then that will be addressed during negotiations prior to award.  Q:  Page 8, Cost/Price Schedule - (1 thru 6) You are asking for 1 price for a pager that includes unlimited paging with toll free Maine number, maint, repair and replacement coverage.  Usually replacement coverage is an additional $1.00 per month per pager and in the past it has always been a separate line item on your RFP so Togus can decide whether to take that option or not.  Do you want to add a line for the Replacement Coverage to separate it out?  Also Maine toll free numbers can not be unlimited so how should I address that in my pricing? A:  The solicitation is what it is, the bidders need to price accordingly. Q:    (7) LED Signs - says 2 for quantity but then 12 for  Unit - so are you asking for the price for the whole year for 2 signs? Not a price for each sign per month?A:   LED signs are currently at 3. Bidder should provide a monthly cost for each device, will additional units if VA decides to expand the use.   Q:   (8) Controller - says 12 for quantity but you really are asking for 3 and 1 spare for  a total of 4? and I assume you are asking for a per month cost? A:  3 alphanumeric pager controllers for Bldgs 200, 209 & 248 are to be provided. Controller costs are to be noted as cost per month per controller.Q:  Does the Government require pagers to be able to interface with Blackberries?A:  No, Blackberries are not available for use throughout the hospital.A site visit and pre-bid conference is scheduled for April 2, 2009 at 1:00 PM at Building 206, Room 216.  Any bidders interested in attending  please register by calling Keith Waye at (207) 626-4746 or via e-mail at keith.waye@va.gov.  This will be only pre-bid conference and walk through scheduled.

<DESC>Several questions have been received relative to this sources sought - market research notice.  The questions and their corresponding answers are provided below for your information.


1) Question:  I am inquiring about the FLIS Transformation RFI for an enterprise workflow tool.  In our initial review of the broad requirements, we believe that two, possibly three COTS products could provide the solution DLIS is looking for.
As a system integrator with no specific tool to our name, we would rather not nominate a single solution at this early stage.  Rather, we would like to know if it would be acceptable to respond to the RFI in the following basic format for section 3, Technical Ideas:
-          Compare and contrast the two or three potential top-tier solutions against the requirements citing pros and cons of each.

-          Recommend that a next step be to further refine the broad requirements to finalize the recommendation to a single COTS product. 

  Answer:  Yes, it would be acceptable to submit a response formatted in this manner.


2) Question:  I'd like to get clarification on the page limit for section 3. Technical Ideas (up to 10 pages). See below.  Does the 10 page limit refer to the Technical Ideas only and therefore a, b, c, & d. is NOT included in the 10 page count?  
      
Answer:  Please limit the RFIs to be 10 pages in length total for all responses to question 3 (including sections 3 a-d).  In your final submission, you may additionally include a cover page and a separate page for any citations (these are not included in the 10-page limit).


3) Question:  We saw the RFI on the FLIS workflow tool and have already started writing our reply to it but we do have a few questions.  We feel confident in our knowledge of the existing applications but we are unsure of the FLIS transformation strategy; do you want to explore technologies that replace the CRS application and the FLIS database wholesale, or is the scope of the project limited to beefing up the CRS workbench to handle additional types of work, or somewhere in between?  Or can this question only be answered after the new technologies outlined in the RFI responses have been evaluated?  

Answer:  Responses to the RFI should be independent of current tools/applications/systems utilized within DLIS.  The focus is on understanding software workflow capabilities and best practices from industry, with a focus on ensuring the technical capabilities outlined in the RFI are met.

                                          - End of questions and answers -

<DESC>This project involves the construction of stream improvement features over approximately 2 miles of Red River.  The work includes instream habitat structure installation, channel relocation, earthwork, and revegetation.  Revegetation will consist of erosion control seeding and on-site transplants only.  This project is located approximately 55 miles east of Grangeville via State Highway 14 to the junction of Red River Road (NFS road 222) then proceeding approximately 10 miles on the Red River Road. The project is located on the Red River Ranger District, Nez Perce National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho.  Price estimate for the total project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  A formal pre-bid tour was held in the Fall of 2007.  The only significant change made since this time is the source location of the trees for the instream structures.  They will be harvested from a unit source located in Deadwood Creek.  No formal pre-bid tour is planned at this time.  Contractors interested in visiting the site may call Karen Ruklic at 208-983-5144 for assistance.  Site photos are also available upon request.  The solicitation was issued 3/35/09.  Responses are due 4/27/09.  Bid bonds are required.  Faxed offers will not be accepted.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER NAVAIR BOA N00019-09-G-0009.
The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a sole-source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) task order to General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) under N00019-09-G-0009.  The required effort is to demonstrate technologies to reduce Specific Fuel Consumption in F/A-18 aircraft engines.  The Navy has designated the F414-GE-400 engine as the demonstration platform for this effort.  The contractor shall provide recommendations and plans for the incorporation of these new technologies into current and future F/A-18 aircraft engines.  Specifically, the contractor shall:  a) demonstrate technologies capable of reducing fuel consumption of the F414-GE-400 engine through a single engine test build, b) quantify the magnitude of actually demonstrated and analytically predicted fuel quantity savings based on test data acquired using those technologies individually and as a full technology suite, c) provide a Fleet incorporation scheme of the technologies, and d) provide a cost estimate for incorporating the technologies, which provides maximum fuel savings in the shortest amount of time.  Points of contact for this announcement are: Contract Specialist Karen Johnston at (301)757-4224, karen.johnston@navy.mil and Contracting Officer Damon McGill at (301)757-7063, damon.mcgill@navy.mil.  Numbered note 22 applies.

<LINENBR>N/A
<ARCHDATE>04262009
<AWARDEE>Multiple, See Below
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Office of General Supplies and Services sought  to establish multiple blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) for acquisition support services against Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 874 Mission Oriented Business Integration Services (MOBIS), Special Item Number (SIN) 874 6, Acquisition Management Support. All offices within GSA, including FAS and Public Building Service (PBS), will have access to a primary and a backup BPA specifically established for their geographic region.  The BPAs can be utilized with or without Recovery Act funds.  The BPA will be used to support specific projects related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and help achieve discounts through agency-wide economies of scale.  President Barack Obamas new economic stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, involves investments in the nation's infrastructure, including construction projects, environmental, and energy initiatives, that will significantly increase GSA's procurement duties.   It is expected that the need for acquisition support services encompasses more than the implementation period of the economic stimulus package, as GSA is already experiencing shortages of experienced contracting personnel needed for specific projects, hence the ongoing need for acquisition management support services.   

The solicitation was issued through GSAs eBuy system as RFQ #343559 on February 6, 2009.  BPAs have been established with Integrity Management Consulting, Inc. as the primary BPA holder and Acquisition Solutions, Inc. and Technical and Project Engineering, LLC as the backup BPA holders for the Regional offices of GSA.   The announcement that GSA had established BPAs with Integrity Management Consulting, Inc. and Acquisition Solutions, Inc. for the National Capital Region/Central Office was made on March 12, 2009.  The location of the work will depend on the details of the Task Order issued against the BPA.   

Since these are BPAs, no funds have been obligated as a result of this action.  The BPAs have a Period of Performance of up to 5 years, with one (1) base year and four (4) option years beginning on the date of establishment.  Details are listed below:
