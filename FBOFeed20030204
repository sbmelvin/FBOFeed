<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation will be negotiating with McRae and Associates for the delivery of twelve (12) Abb 192 kV rated EXLIM-Q station class metal oxide gapless surge arresters with porcelain tops.  The style number shall be Q192XB152A.  In 2001 a matching set of three of these surge arresters were purchased competitively.  According to a technical bulletin published in 2002, surge arresters on each end of a high voltage cable need to be of the same design.  If surge arresters of different types are "protecting" the same high voltage cables the new metal oxide gapless surge arrester will do all of the work.  This causes premature failure of the new arresters.  All three phases on both high voltage underground cables must be protected by the same type and design as the three purchased in 2001.  This purchase will assure that the set of three spares will work in any of the 12 locations currently needing surge protection.

<DESC>The Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) Program Office, (AOS-900), of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to procure router software, support drivers, Level II maintenance support (the FAA will provide Level I maintenance and spares) and implementation engineering activities. The FAA requires four sets of router software and support drivers.  Two sets will be installed in FAA owned Dell servers located in the Salt Lake City National Network Control Center (NNCC) and two sets in FAA owned Dell servers located in Washington, DC.    <P> The maximum estimated value is $625,000 with a minimum estimated value of $100,000 for a fixed price indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract of up to five years.    <P> The ATN Program Office, AOS-900, entered into an agreement with the Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) on February 12, 1998.  This agreement initiated trial and connectivity testing to implement ATN and the FAA owned ATS Message Handling System (AMHS) service to support the anticipated additional air traffic demands in the Asia/Pacific region.  The FAA and JCAB successfully conducted connectivity and interoperability testing during 2001.      <P> OKI Electric Industry Co. LTD (OKI) developed ATN router software for use by the JCAB air traffic control system.  This unique and proprietary OKI software follows strict international aviation development guidelines and uses the Windows NT operating system.  The FAA employed the OKI router software during successful compatibility and interoperability testing with JCAB in 2001 and it was found to meet all the desired technical and operational requirements.  The FAA uses the OKI router software for the international data service component of ATN and if used in the U.S. will provide an economy of scale, operational efficiency, interoperability and commonality of equipment.    <P> The FAA is required to obtain the software and support drivers in March 2003 to meet the integration and security processes needed for the initiation of the service with Japan.  The agreement between the FAA and JCAB specifies the need to have the system deployed by August 2003 in order to initiate ATN service by March 2004.      <P> The FAA requires Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) functionality that will allow the FAA to integrate into existing and future telecommunication networks (Bandwidth Management and FAA Telecommunication Infrastructure).  The IS-IS function involves the least technical risk and is the most cost effective route for the FAA.  IS-IS allows for the use of existing FAA telecommunication networks at the interface points within the FAA domain.  Without the IS-IS function, the FAA would be required to deploy the ATN routers with separate circuits at every Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), and other FAA facility where this application is located.    <P> The FAA plans to award this contract to OKI, if anyone can provide router software and support drivers having the required compatibility with the international data service component of ATN, delivery time (March 2003) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) function, please respond by e-mail to dixie.harper@faa.gov.   <P>

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) announces a program in the area of Dual Use Science and Technology (DUS&T).  This Broad Agency Announcement seeks projects to create and/or develop new products or process technologies, in most cases, on a 50/50 cost share basis.  The DUS&T Program requires that the proposed technology have both military relevance and potential benefit (cost, performance, or sustainability of defense systems) and sufficient potential commercial (non-defense) applications to support a viable production base.  The offeror must normally bear at least 50% of the cost of the effort and at least 50% of this cost share must be high quality (i.e., cash, labor, or consumable materials).  The projects must result in the development of a technology, not the application of a technology.  The proposer must be a for-profit company or have at least one for-profit firm on its team.  Due to limited funding, the Government reserves the right to limit awards under any topic, and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded.  Please note that this is an announcement to declare AFRL's intent to competitively fund dual-use technology projects and that no other request for proposals, solicitation, or announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions are encouraged to participate.  Teaming arrangements, especially with academia, are encouraged when the result is a technically stronger proposal.  Awards will be made using a class of nonprocurement instruments called Technology Investment Agreements (TIAs).  The TIA's are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), but instead are governed by the DoD Grants and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).  The DODGARS and sample TIA modules may be found at http://www.afmc-pub.wpafb.af.mil/organizations/HQ-AFMC/PK/pkt/assistance.htm.  A description of TIAs may be found at http://alpha.lmi.org/dodgars/tia_rev2.pdf.  The DUS&T proposal guidelines and submission instructions are found at http://www.afrl.af.mil/dualuse/index.htm.  Full proposals are due by 1600 EDT 11 Jul 02 at the address identified in each Service topic area.  This BAA, however, shall remain open for one year from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  Proposals received after 1600 EDT 11 Jul 02 shall be considered only to the extent that funding remains available beyond the initial selection.  White paper synopses of the planned DUS&T proposals including rough cost estimates are encouraged from any interested company or consortium prior to the submission of the full proposal. Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/.

A - HARSH ENVIRONMENT ROBUST MICROMECHANICAL TECHNOLOGY, SOL BAA 03-11, DUE 032803, POC DR. CLARK T.-C. NGUYEN, DARPA/MTO, FAX (571) 218-4556

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Harsh Environment Robust Micromechanical Technology (HERMIT).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state-of-practice.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) implementations of HERMIT, with the ultimate objective being the realization of micromechanical devices capable of operating under harsh conditions-e.g., under large temperature excursions, large power throughputs, high g-forces, presence of corrosive substances, etc.-while maintaining unprecedented performance, stability, and lifetime. HERMIT implementations that result in long storage lifetimes for micromechanical devices are also desired. Although HERMIT realizations of micromechanical RF switches are of particular interest-especially for reliable operation over several billions of cycles, where sizable power throughputs across an impacting interface constitute a harsh operational environment-implementations for vibrating resonator frequency reference elements, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and other DoD-relevant MEMS devices, that attain order of magnitude improvements over the state-of-practice, are also desired. The two HERMIT implementation approaches of most interest are: (1) wafer-level encapsulation or packaging strategies based on MEMS technology that isolate a micromechanical device from its surroundings while maintaining a desired environment via passive or active control; or (2) material and design engineering strategies that enhance the robustness of a micromechanical device and render it impervious to its environment, with or without a package (if possible). Ultra-small size (on the order of chip-scale) and low power are paramount for any proposed approach. In addition, approaches that harness small size or micro-scale properties to attain better performance (e.g., lower power) would be of particular interest. Research topics and activities relevant to the implementation of HERMIT might include, but are not limited to: (1) modular technologies for low-cost wafer-level packaging; (2) strategies for micro-scale environmental control; (3) novel designs that eliminate failure mechanisms and suppress susceptibility to environmental perturbations; (4) understanding the physics of failure pursuant to identifying accelerated lifetime test procedures for both devices and packages (if used); (5) surface physics studies, perhaps pursuant to development of surface passivation treatments; (6) engineering of micromachinable structural and dielectric materials, including alloying; (7) in situ repair or recovery methods; (8) boardless integration of micromechanics and packages with control circuitry; (9) micromechanical isolation technology, such as oven control or microphonic damping networks; and (10) temperature independent design.

HERMIT is ultimately expected to yield micromechanical devices with unprecedented performance and stability specifications, such as (but not limited to):

(1)	Micromechanical RF switches with less than 0.3 dB of on-state insertion loss at Ka-band (27-40 GHz) and capable of passing up to one watt of power while switching over more than 100 billion cycles, with little or no susceptibility to radiation or temperature excursions over the military range;
(2)	Vibrating micromechanical resonators with frequencies greater than 100 MHz, Q's exceeding 10,000, fractional frequency temperature stabilities better than 0.01 ppm over the military range (or wider), survivability under more than 20,000 g of acceleration, and aging rates less than 0.5 ppm/year, all with less than 5 mW of power consumption.
(3)	Micromechanical gyroscopes with bias stabilities better than 0.1 deg/hr maintained over the military temperature range and with less than 0.3 deg/hr drift after 20,000 g of acceleration, all with less than 5 mW of power consumption.

Note that the above are merely examples meant to provide rough order of magnitude descriptions of what constitutes "substantial performance and stability improvements", and are not to be construed as complete, nor as rigid program specifications.

HERMIT-enabled devices with characteristics similar to the above and achieved via low cost, batch fabrication methods are expected to enable a myriad of strategic capabilities. In particular, reliable low-loss micromechanical switches will make possible small, low-power true-time delay units for phased array antennas used in radars, as well as reconfigurable filters and antenna networks at microwave and higher frequencies. HERMIT-enabled vibrating micromechanical resonators with long-term stabilities approaching that of atomic clocks, Q's and power handling levels sufficient for excellent short-term stability, and frequencies exceeding that of conventional ultra-high-Q tanks (e.g., quartz crystals), will enable single-chip synthesizers for military radar and communications with exceptional close-to-carrier phase noise performance. Timing-critical applications, such as military GPS and secure communication devices, also stand to benefit enormously from the ultra-stable frequency output of such devices. Gyroscopes with tactical- to navigation-grade bias stabilities will be instrumental in enabling guided munitions and self-navigating micro-air vehicles, as well as an assortment of other small, autonomous maneuvering devices. In addition, any smart packaging technologies developed under this program stand to substantially benefit a much wider set of MEMS devices in both sheer performance and reliability.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-11 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

DARPA strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. Teaming among academic, industrial and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan. A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Harsh Environment Robust Micromechanical Technology Program will consist of a Phase I effort (18 months) followed by an optional Phase II (18 months) and Phase III (18 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards are expected to be made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).   Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged.  A web site-http://teaming.sysplan.com/HERMIT-BAA-03-11/-has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Although teamed efforts are strongly encouraged, the program will also support some very innovative individual investigator efforts.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Clark T.-C. Nguyen, phone: (571) 218-4586, fax: (571) 218-4556, electronic mail: cnguyen@darpa.mil

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 03-11, Harsh Environment Robust Micromechanical Technology, Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on Harsh Environment Robust Micromechanical Technology, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals. An original and seven (7) copies of the proposal abstract and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the abstract [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM] should be submitted. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-11, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2. The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-11) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, February 28, 2003. Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed. Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal. Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and seven (7) copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM]. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-11, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2. The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-11) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, March 28, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-11 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/ MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Harsh Environment Robust Micromechanical Technology. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 03-11.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort. 

The administrative addresses for this BAA are:

Fax:  (703) 351-8616 (Addressed to: DARPA/MTO, BAA 03-11),

<DESC>NA This announcement is to provide notice that a sole source, modification to a current contract, award is anticipated.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The impending procurement is to provide the Program Executive Office fo r Chemical and Biological Defense (PEO-CBD), Falls Church, VA, with the necessary nonpersonal services to implement Phase II of the Integrated Digital Environment (IDE) required to directly support the PEOs effort against the war on terrorism and efforts related to the defense against biological weapons and weapons of mass destruction.  This Phase II of the current IDE will 1) extend the current functionality to include the US Navy, US Air Force and the US Marine Corps, 2) create computer code to establish  data interfaces between many of the automated systems with the IDE, and 3) augment and enhance IDE functionality at the current satellite sites.  The expected value of this action is $1.58 Million.  Because of the critical nature of this procurement and b ecause the current contractor has the institutional memory, background and specialized experience required to ensure the success of this critical effort within the mandated time lines, a non competitive award to the DynPort Vaccine Company (DVC), 64 Thomas  Johnson Drive, Frederick, MD 21702 will be made under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Subcontracting opportunities may exist.  Interested parties should contact the DVC Subcontracts Manager, Ms. Donna Dawson at (301) 607-5009.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award a sole source contract to the University of Mali in West Africa.  This acquisition requires the support of an infrastructure able to support the NIAID,  HIV/AIDS Research Program in Mali.  The NIAID has selected Mali as a primary site for HIV/AIDS research because of the epidemiology of the disease in this country, and its still low prevalence. An important consideration is the existence of an already highly developed NIAID program in malaria with basic facilities which can be shared with the HIV/AIDS program. Among these are a unique communications system and LAN which links the NIAID facilities in Mali directly to the NIAID in Bethesda. There will also be shared conference rooms, a library, ,and a repository for specimen storage. THE HIV/AIDS program will participate in the NIH sponsored Minority Student Training Program based at the Medical School in Bamako.  Mali also provides models and situations for disease transmission intensities from generally low levels to significantly higher rates of transmission in clearly defined high risk groups. The HIV/AIDS Research Program at the National School of Medicine of Mali (FMPOS) is the only basic research program in the country capable of carrying out the programs outlined by NIAID staff. Laboratories are currently under construction and the staff is being trained to support the NIAID effort. These include facilities for diagnosis using the most modern tools of molecular  biology. It is anticipated that a fixed-price requirement type contract with a base year and two one-year option periods will be awarded.  The current contract was a sole-source award made to the University of Mali. For this reason, and based on the support services provided by the contractor described above, the Government believes that no other offerors are currently available to provide these services. Any questions regarding this requirement should be addressed to Carolyn Wilder, Contract specialist, at  (301) 402-6724, or cwilder@niaid.nih.gov  before the synopsis closing date of 
March  7, 2003. See number note 22.

<DESC>Reference Pre-Solicitation Notice No. 20 issued on 28 Jan 03 which is cancelled and is replaced by Pre-Solicitation Notice No. 22 that follows: Reference Pre-Solicitation Notice No. 63 issued on 21 Jun 02 and No. 72 issued on 18 Jul 02.  The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Program office, is contemplating negotiating a contract modification with Boeing Launch Services, Inc. (BLS).  This procurement will add launch services for National Reconnaissance Office Launch (NROL) West Coast Missions NROL-25, NROL-41, NROL-39 and NROL-45 to the existing Boeing Launch Services (BLS) EELV Initial Launch Services (ILS) contract (FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items). The Government reserves the right to award one, two, three or four of these missions. The Request for Proposal will be issued in February 2003 and the(se) launch service(s) must be awarded by 30 Apr 03.  The first launch is projected for FY05 and the last launch is projected for FY08. The EELV program is an expendable space launch system that will satisfy the Government portion of the National Launch Forecast (excluding crew-rated or cargo return missions), reduce overall system recurring costs, and maintain or improve the reliability, operability, and capability of current medium through heavy lift systems (heritage launch systems). The EELV system includes, but is not limited to, launch vehicles, facilities, support equipment, and payload integration in support of the launch of spacecrafts for the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Departments of Transportation and Commerce.  As a result of a competitive acquisition held in 1998, the EELV ILS contracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Inc. and Boeing Launch Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, on 16 Oct 98.  The Government has been contracting with these contractors since 1995 for the development of an EELV system and launch services on a limited source basis.  Through competitive down-selections these two firms were proven to be the only two contractors capable of performing the requirements of the EELV Program.  A Justification and Approval Document (J&A) to contract with only these two sources for EELV launch services was approved on 9 Jun 98.  Amendment 01 to the J&A was approved on 15 Aug 00 which permits:  (a) Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to either Boeing or Lockheed Martin, and (b) launch services that must be conducted from the West Coast to be awarded on a sole source basis to Boeing. Any other interested parties must (1) be U.S. manufacturers as defined in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request for Proposal, (2) have demonstrated launch vehicle installed on launch pad and vehicle power-on successfully, and (3) have the capability to meet the program schedule and ability to support the standardization of launch sites. Firms which did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Verification, EMD and Development contracts, and which believe they can compete as prime contractors in the ILS effort are encouraged to submit a statement of capability and qualification (limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to:  SMC/MVK, Attn:  Ms Judy Parnock, Contracting Officer, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467/A-2, Los Angeles AFB, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.  See CBD announcements posted 5 Aug 97 (W-212 SN104464) and 30 Dec 97 (W-364 SN154623) for further information on the EELV program.  This CBD synopsis is not a formal solicitation.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.  See Note 22.

This package will be used on the displays/mounts that are part of the LHA 5 IFFCS System. The IFFCS System is an existing, Fleet fielded, shock-qualified system. The hardware/software package is compatible with the LHA 5 IFFCS and has been shock qualified tested; therefore, this acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition. It is estimated that re-qualifying the entire IFFCS System, and compatible software, would cost the U.S. Navy hundreds of thousands of dollars and would take several mont hs to complete, thus significantly delaying delivery to the fleet. Any source interested in qualifying other hardware/software packages for future acquisitions should contact Mr. Michael Conn, CSS, Code R52, Panama City, FL, 32407, (850) 235-5750.NAICS Code 541512 applies.

<DESC>02/03/2003- By David P Hershey SPAWAR SYSTEMS CENTER, SAN DIEGO intends to negotiate a sole-source contract modification with Georgia Technology Applied Research Corporation (GTARC), Atlanta, GA under the existing contract N66001-01-C-8043.  This action will extend the period of performance through 01 January 2006 .  The estimated increase in the contract total is $600,000.00.  This action is sole source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The objective to the modification of this completion type contract is to assist the Government in the development of computer software standards that define a Morphware Stable Interface for emerging polymorphous computing architectures by conducting a Morphware Stable Interface Facilitation effort. This modification is a continuation of research in direct support of the original contract. This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available.  Questions concerning this sole source modification may be directed to David Hershey at david.hershey@navy.mil. Use of any other source for this modification would result in duplication of cost and time to develop the technical capability within another contractor(s) workforce resulting in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) solicits proposals for investigations of navigation, control, and mission design algorithms that enable and/or enhance formation flying and distributed sensing missions.  The program goals are not mission specific. This NRA solicits proposals that will develop revolutionary flight dynamics and control technologies supporting fault-tolerant Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) systems for distributed space systems (DSS) in any orbit.  In particular, it seeks investigations that will utilize new principles, such as dynamical systems theory, decentralized and nonlinear control, and analytic redundancy.  Of equal interest are new technology concepts, including safe mode for formations, and, the use of drag and solar radiation pressure for orbit control.  Also of equal interest are proposals that perform proofs of concept, algorithm validations, and flight software prototyping.  Of further and equal interest are proposals studying spacecraft formation guidance and trajectory planning.  Proposers should seek to demonstrate algorithms that will allow for the minimization of initial launch mass and the maximization of mission duration, using current state of the art and next generation technologies. The focus of this NRA is primarily on mission design, guidance, navigation, and control of the absolute and relative orbits of formation flying spacecraft, and as such it does not explicitly solicit research on attitude determination and control.  However, a focus on the six degree of freedom (6DOF) problem as is pertinent to formation flying analysis will have potential for a higher degree of preference than solely investigating the orbital relative navigation and/or control problem.  It will be essential that the fundamental issues of orbital mechanics are adequately addressed in either case.  Specifically, the technology areas solicited by this NRA include: 1.  Precision Formation Control Architectures.	This topic includes all aspects of absolute and relative trajectory tracking of nominal trajectories, based on the benchmark problems described below.  Relative stationkeeping is of greater interest than control of the overall formations state, but approaches that address both problems together are encouraged.	Both propulsive and non-propulsive (e.g. solar sail-type) maneuvering techniques may be considered.  Investigators are encouraged to study nominal stability and performance as well as robustness to model uncertainties and disturbances.  In general, simpler approaches are preferred, and investigators should plan to address implementability in terms of current or next generation sensors, actuators, and onboard computers.  Of primary interest to this NRA are the following subtopics: 1a.  Control of Earth Orbiting Missions.  This subtopic covers all missions in which the gravitational influence of the earth is the primary external force.  Applicability to other bodies is of minor interest.  Disturbances that should be considered include but are not limited to drag, solar radiation pressure, and non-primary gravitational bodies.  Of particular interest in this call are the LEO and HEO benchmark problems described below. 1b.  Control of Libration Point Missions. This subtopic covers all missions in which the gravitational influence of at least two major bodies plays a significant role, so that approximations of the three-body problem of Lagrange are applicable.  Of major interest are missions in large repeating trajectories around the co-linear equilibrium points surrounding the secondary body, and in particular, the Sun-Earth/Moon system is of interest, as the benchmark problem below describes. Control of deep-space missions, in which the sun may be considered as the central body, is of secondary interest in this NRA, but approaches that are equally applicable to both deep space missions and either or both of the above subtopics are of special interest.	     2.  Precise Relative Navigation for High Earth and Libration Point Missions. This topic includes all aspects of relative orbit determination based on the benchmark problems described below, but especially on the HEO and libration point missions.  Relative navigation is of greater interest than estimation of the overall formations state, but approaches that address both problems together are encouraged.	Navigation algorithms of interest include, but are not limited to, those that perform relative and simultaneous navigation of multiple spacecraft using GPS beyond LEO, celestial navigation, very-high-precision relative ranging techniques using optical and radio frequency cross-links, and passive techniques such as reflected GPS and angles-only relative state measurements.  Realistic sensor biases and random disturbances should be considered.   3.  Design of Formations. This topic includes all aspects of mission design and formation guidance law development, including specification of nominal absolute and relative trajectories for initialization, reconfiguration, and decommissioning.  This topic is not constrained to the benchmark problems described below.  Due to significant differences in dynamics, this topic is divided into the following subtopics: 3a.  Design of Earth Orbiting Missions. This subtopic covers all missions in which the gravitational influence of the earth is the primary external force.  Applicability to other bodies is of minor interest. 3b.	Design of Libration Point Missions. This subtopic covers all missions in which the gravitational influence of at least two major bodies plays a significant role, so that approximations of the three-body problem of Lagrange are applicable.  Of major interest are missions in medium to large amplitude repeating trajectories around the co-linear equilibrium points surrounding the secondary body, and in particular, the Sun-	 Earth/Moon system is of interest. Design of deep-space missions, in which the sun may be considered as the central body, is of secondary interest in this NRA, but approaches that are equally applicable to both deep space missions and either or both of the above subtopics are of special interest.     4.  Fault Tolerance, Collision Avoidance, and Formation Safe Hold. This is an interdisciplinary topic that includes all aspects of relative trajectory estimation and control in off-nominal circumstances, such detected and undetected failures and significant degradations of performance in sensors, actuators, communications systems, onboard processors or busses, etc.  It also covers all aspects of predicting unplanned close approaches and any other anomalies that would require that the formation enter a stable safe mode of operations.	Design of such safe mode formation configurations that would allow time for recovery operations without loss of the formation due to collision, dispersal, or other circumstances is of special interest.  Algorithms for fault detection, identification, and recovery are of interest, as are control and estimation architectures that enhance overall mission reliability via distribution or decentralization of the estimation, guidance, and/or control computations.	  In addition to technology that leads to lower mission costs by directly lowering mission element costs, technology development that lowers development cost by lowering risk will also be evaluated favorably.  Finally, demonstration of a possible commercial application and/or application to future NASA, DoD, or commercial missions will also be considered positively. 	 To provide high-level focus to the research, NASA is supplying the following benchmark problems.  These problems are not specific to any current or proposed mission, but instead are intended to capture high-level features that would be generic to many similar missions.  Proposers are requested but not required to use these problems as the basis of test cases for their technology concepts.	     Low Earth Orbit.  The formation is defined by a reference point, which follows a sun-synchronous orbit with a nominal altitude of 400 km.  There are six 3-axis stabilized spacecraft, three equally spaced in each of two oppositely inclined projected circular formations 500 m in diameter.  That is, when projected into the local horizontal plane, the paths of relative motion about the reference (there are two such paths containing the two sets of three spacecraft) are circles.  This relative motion can be achieved through a combination of differences in the orbital elements from the reference.  The planes of relative motion are then inclined +/-26.6 degrees relative to the local horizontal plane.  The relative positions of the spacecraft should be controlled with respect to their desired relative trajectories to within 5 m or better.  The nominal mission duration is two years. High Earth Orbit.  The average position of the formation follows a 1.2 by18 Earth radii orbit, lying in the ecliptic plane, where the initial line of apsides is parallel to the direction to the sun, and apogee is opposite the sun.  There are four spin-stabilized spacecraft that must form a 10 km regular tetrahedron at apogee, with arbitrary orientation.	A tetrahedral configuration need not be maintained at any other point in the orbit.  The spacecrafts spin rate is 20 RPM, and the spin axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. The spacecrafts relative positions should be controlled to within 10% of the separation at apogee, subject to a 1 km minimum separation constraint throughout the orbit.  The nominal mission duration is two years. Libration Point.	The formation follows a medium lissajous orbit about the trans-terrestrial, now commonly known as L2, co-linear libration point of the Sun-Earth/Moon system, with y amplitude of approximately 300,000 km and z amplitude equal to or less than the y amplitude.  There are 20 3 axis stabilized spacecraft, each a subaperture along an aspherical surface with a 250 m radius.  The subapertures are distributed over the asphere in an arbitrary configuration so as to produce a large number of internal baselines internal to a sparse primary telescope aperture.  A single spacecraft is located 100 km away at the focus, along the line of sight to the science target, such that the whole configuration forms a distributed Fizeau interferometer.	There two modes of operation:	    A science mode, in which the aperture must stare in an inertially fixed direction for up to a month, with relative positions controlled to within 1 cm.	While staring, the formation must rotate about the line of sight to the target at least once per week, and the internal baselines of the aperture must vary somewhat arbitrarily during the rotation.	 A maneuver mode, in which the line of sight of the aperture must slew on the order of 20 degrees per day to acquire a new science target. The nominal mission duration is 12 years. Participation in this program is closed to NASA Centers and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but otherwise open to all categories of domestic organizations, including educational institutions, profit and nonprofit organizations, and other Government agencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, other minority educational institutions, and small businesses and organizations owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or women are particularly encouraged to apply. The entirety of this NRA may be found and downloaded in a variety of standard formats on the web site:	    http://gsfctechnology.gsfc.nasa.gov/nraannouncements.htm	Proposals in response to this NRA may request periods of performance for up to three years.	NASA's ability to fund the proposals selected under this NRA is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds.  Approximately $1 million per year is expected to be available to support this program, and it is expected that awards in the range of $50,000-$100,000 per year will be made.  There will be two types of awards: (a) &lt;$60,000: most of the awards will be of this nature and these will be funded at one time.  (b) $100,000 - $120,000: a few will awarded at this value and the funds will be sent incrementally throughout the year.  A single institution and/or investigator may apply for more than one award, and to more than one technology area.  Many of the awards will take the form of grants and cooperative agreements; note that	 http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/grants/grants.htm	      contains information about the requirements and regulations covering these types of awards, as well as information about current and pending awards.	Winning proposers are expected to work closely with Goddard Space Flight Centers Distributed Space Systems team,	   http://gsfctechnology.gsfc.nasa.gov	      to integrate their technologies with GSFCs efforts, and to demonstrate the technical maturity of their investigations via high-fidelity relevant test environments, such as the GSFCs Formation Flying Testbed.  Such demonstrations might represent an actual system application or might only be similar to the planned application using the same technologies.	  NASA reserves the right to make any data developed under this NRA public.  It is expected that winning proposers will submit a final report that contains detailed design information, including full mathematical description, source code, and schematics as appropriate.  These reports will be published in a series of NASA contractor reports, which are subject to export controls (see        http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codei/nasaecp        for details).  The final results of the investigation must also be summarized in the open literature in recognized professional journals and/or conference proceedings.	Note that the organization sponsoring this award requires that all publications sponsored by it be submitted to an internal NASA review prior to presentation or publication in any public forum.	   Notice of Intent (NOI) to propose: Due date:   February 21, 2003 Address for submission:       E-mail: Jesse.A.Leitner@nasa.gov or  Fax: 301-286-1719   Submission of Proposal:	       Required number:Five(5)hard copies-Four(4)copies plus signed original or electronic submission:	   http://gsfctechnology.gsfc.nasa.gov/nraannouncements.htm	User name and password to perform the electronic submission can be obtained by sending an e-mail to maria.m.so@nasa.gov.

Further, potential bidders must respond affirmatively to prequalification question three (3) or provide a written commitment to obtain an ASME N Stamp for Section III, Class 2 as described therein.

Summary Scope of Work:

The scope of work (SOW) for this Subcontract will include the design, material procurement, fabrication, testing, and shipment of the prototype disposal container in accordance with ASME Code.  The ultimate purpose of disposal containers will be to dispose of spent nuclear fuel in an underground repository.

The details of the prototype disposal container are listed below, however, due to the inability to post the drawing on this site, please visit BSC's website at BSCUpdate.com to access the drawing. (This prequalification notice is posted in "Active RFP Prequalifications" under "Vendor/Supplier Information."  The drawing is on Page 5 of 5.)

1. The prototype disposal container length is nominally 200 inches, with an outer diameter of 65 inches and weighs approximately 60,000 pounds.

2. The prototype disposal container is composed of an outer barrier, inner vessel, and basket assembly.

3. The prototype inner vessel shall be constructed of 316L SA240 (UNS S31603) with extra restrictions on carbon and nitrogen, and have the ASME Code N Symbol Stamp affixed in accordance with the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III, Division 1, Subsection NC (Class 2 pressure vessel).  Subcontractor will furnish a Certified ASME Design Report for this vessel.

4. The prototype outer barrier shall be constructed of SB-575 (UNS N06022) for corrosion protection, and shall be constructed using materials, welding, and nondestructive examination in accordance with the provisions of the ASME Boiler Pressure and Vessel Code Section III, Division 1, Subsection NC (Class 2 pressure vessel).  The outer barrier will be built in accordance with Contractor supplied drawings and fabrication specification.  No ASME Design Specification will be provided; no ASME Design Report will be required; and the barrier will not be required to be ASME Code stamped.  It will be inspected by an Authorized Nuclear Inspector and certified on a Contractor-supplied non-Code Data Report Form to meet the specified provisions of a Contractor-supplied Fabrication Specification, which will reference the required specific provisions of the the ASME Code.

5. The prototype basket assembly is an "egg-crate" design that is composed of SB-209 A96061 T4 and Neutronit A978TM (borated stainless steel) with SA-516, Grade 70 (UNS K02700) for basket guides and tubes.  The basket assembly shall be constructed using ASME Code Section II for materials, ASME Code Section IX for welding.  Welds connecting basket assembly to the inner vessel shall be performed to Section III, Division 1, Subsection NC.  The basket assembly will not be required to be ASME Code Stamped.

6. The RFP will specify that the prototype shall be fabricated from rolled and welded plate.  This specification is necessary to ensure that the prototype container meets certain project requirements.  However, future prototype procurements will consider alternative fabrication techniques that meet all of the applicable disposal container requirements (e.g. ASME Code, materials of fabrication, dimensions, surface condition, etc), offer potential advantages over the baseline fabrication technique, and have been demonstrated for vessels of similar size to the prototype.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611710   Agricultural, Enviornmental, and Development Economics Analysis - Ohio State University Public Notice - February 3, 2003  Procurement Office: US Evironmental Protection Agency, Administrative Contract Service Center (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington DC   20460  Title: Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics Analysis - Ohio State University  Response Date: February 11, 2003 The United States Environmental Protection Agency, under Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the  Ohio State University, Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics. This award is based on staff there being uniquely qualified to provide this analysis to EPA.  Within the field of international forestry modeling, no other US research firm (firm) or consulting group  (group) have expertise in estimating the potential for carbon sequestration from global forest quantified in carbon equivalent emission prices ($/TCE).  In addition, no other firm or group has distinguished forest data by specific land-cover and age class arrays that can be easily transferred into  the particular agro-ecological zones required by EPA.  Finally, no other firm or group has a model like the Dynamic Forestry Model that takes into account the necessary international timber trade and temporal aspects of the problem. The model also fully reports forestry income, production,  consumption, as well as environmental attributes.  This department's expertise and the Dynamic Forestry Model and data are unique because many of the key functions and relationships within the global forestry sector are directly linked to carbon sequestration and already have been incorporated into  and refined within this model.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) World Trade Center Investigation is to investigate the building construction, the materials used, and the technical conditions that contributed to the outcome of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster.  The NIST Investigation Plan can be found at http://wtc.nist.gov, including a description of Projects 7 and 8.  

The objective of this Statement of Work is to contract for survey services.  The offeror shall have a federal-recognized Institutional Review Board (IRB) and obtain approval for this data collection effort from said IRB.  NIST Legal Counsel will review the recommendations and provide approval of the IRB to ensure compliance with all applicable statutes regarding human subjects and privacy.  The IRB approved survey will consist of both development and execution of questionnaires (administered over the telephone), interviews (administered face to face), and focus groups.  The survey shall minimize the impact upon the population, maximize the investigative yield, and coordinate with other studies.  The results of these surveys will be delivered to NIST in an encoded database.  The successful Offeror will NOT analyze the data or develop any conclusions based upon the data collection effort.  This requirement involves three separate tasks.  The first task is the development of the survey instruments, database design, finalization of survey protocols, and the attainment of IRB approval.  This task may additionally require limited interaction with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in order to attain final survey approval from said agency.  Initiation of task two (survey execution) and completion of task three (database delivery) are contingent upon final approval from OMB.  The second task is the conduct of the questionnaire, interview, and focus group protocols, as well as final field work report delivery.  The third task is the completion and delivery of the database, along with technical assistance to NIST in computing database statistics (regression, correlation, variance, significance, etc) and producing database-generated output.  

Details of this requirement will be provided in the solicitation.  The Government anticipates the award of a commercial Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for a period of one (1) year.  It is anticipated that a single solicitation will be issued on or about February 13, 2003 at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation, all amendments and any questions and answers to the solicitation will be posted to FEDBIZOPPS and are totally the responsibility of the Offeror.  No mailing lists will be kept and no hard copy of the RFQ will be available.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has undertaken an initiative to modernize the Filing and Payment Compliance (FPC) program.  The FPC project is a joint effort between IRS and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC, the PRIME) and is aimed at reducing the overall collection time, while improving customer and employee satisfaction.  During the strategic planning effort for transition to the modernized environment, it has been observed that Modernized Systems alone may not sufficiently address the large inventory of collection work.  The IRS, working together with the PRIME, decided to perform an analysis of collection contract support options.  The collection third party contract support analysis involved an analysis of best practices related to receivable management and collections.  At the conclusion of the analysis, the FPC project team presented its? results to IRS management along with contract support alternatives.  The alternatives addressed strategies for resolving the current collection inventory and the potential for integrated and embedded third party contract support in the modernized FPC design.  To enable the IRS/PRIME to perform an effective analysis of the options available, in January 2002 the IRS issued a Request for Information (RFI).  The January 2002 RFI requested information to determine what skills collection contract support vendors could provide to the IRS, including: training, modeling, inventory management, human resources management, software products, and collection services.  Additionally, from the information gathered, and in conjunction with a current/future state gap analysis, the IRS/PRIME sought to determine how to incorporate collection contract support vendors as an interim solution, part of the long-term strategy, or both, as appropriate.  Specifically, the IRS/PRIME requested potential collection contract support vendors to provide information on a variety of issues, such as, preferred compensation methods including frequency and performance incentives.  Input on specific type of receivables most favorable to the industry practices and expected recovery rates based on delinquency amount, delinquency age, prior collection efforts, etc.  Interested parties provided input on a variety of security practices including personnel screening, data security, computer security and physical security capabilities.  Input was received on collection contract support performance measurement criteria in a balanced-measures environment, to include business results, customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction.  Input was received on the preferred technology and methodology for account information exchange between the IRS and collection contract support vendors.  Additionally, the IRS sought information from the industry perspective on the impact of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, privacy and disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA98) on the collection contract support vendors' ability to effectively assist the IRS in its collection activities.  The IRS/PRIME reviewed the written responses to the January 2002 RFI from parties demonstrating experience with projects of similar scope and magnitude, and/or parties with unique and unusual solutions to a variety of the requested data elements on which we are gathering information.  As a result of this evaluation/review, 3 collection service providers were selected as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to partner with the IRS/PRIME to provide input to design the future IRS collection contract support model.  The SMEs participated in informal meetings with the IRS/PRIME periodically over several months by providing private sector input from a collection services provider perspective as the IRS further refined the collection contract support initiative.  PRESENT:  As a result of this collaborative effort, the subject February 2003 draft Request for Information, TIRNO-03-H-00001, has been developed and will be issued on February 14, 2003, via the IRS Procurement webpage at www.procurement.irs.treas.gov.  The February 2003 RFI will be open for comment by the business community for a minimum of 45 calendar days.  After issuance of the RFI, all additional information concerning the RFI (amendments, status updates, etc) will be announced in FebBizOps and posted to the IRS Procurement website.  Questions concerning the RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to: *collection.inquiries@irs.gov.  In order to ensure a timely response, questions should be received by the Contracting Officer at least 15 CALENDAR days before the RFI closing date.  After this date, the Government will make every effort, but cannot guarantee that submitted questions will be answered before the RFI closing date.  The February RFI will be modified based on industry input and released as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) only if and when the IRS receives the required authorization from Congress to proceed with implementation of the collection contract support initiative.  Additionally, as a point of information, should Congressional approval be given, the decision has been made to contract for these services through the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), Financial and Business Solutions (FABS), under Special Item Number (SIN) 520-4, Debt Collection Services.  Interested firms who are not on FABS should contact Bertha L. Gelhaus (bertha.gelhaus@gsa.gov) at GSA for information about becoming qualified under SIN 520-4 and about potential workshops conducted by GSA on the subject of how to get on Schedule.  Current FABS Schedule holders need to contact Ms. Gelhaus to ensure that their contracts contain a pricing structure appropriate to the type of activity we will seek and that all incidental items are included in their contracts.  All potential offerors must be on the FABS schedule at the time of offer submission under the final Request for Quotations to be eligible to receive an award.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>TIME REVERSAL METHODS, SOL BAA 03-02, Addendum 3, DUE 051403, POC:  DR. CAREY SCHWARTZ, DARPA/DSO, Fax:  571-218-4553, E-mail: baa03-02@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso.  The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new research for TIME REVERSAL METHODS.  This new program represents a thrust area for DSO that will comprise a multi-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach with far reaching impact.  Time Reversal Methods: Active and passive sensor systems often receive signals that include contributions derived from multipath scattering effects.  Systems effected by multipath include, for example, active acoustic, sonar, LADAR, and radar modalities including synthetic aperture, inverse synthetic aperture, and over the horizon.  Further the ability to obtain imagery through foliage and other types of clutter impacts the ability to detect and recognize targets.  Conventional approaches to obtaining imagery in the presence of clutter rely on utilization of wavelengths larger than the scale of the clutter resulting in a spatial resolution that is limited by the long wavelength probe or special timing schemes.  The presence of multipath scattering also strongly affects wireless and acoustic communication systems resulting in suboptimal bandwidth utilization and limited communication capacity as suggested by current research in the area of Multiple Input Multiple Output systems.  Time reversal methods are mathematical approaches to the inverse problem that seek to exploit the presence of multiple scattering that show promise for estimation of channels and the presence of objects within the channel.  Time reversal methods are based in part on the concept of employing a single source and multiple receivers.  A portion of the signal recorded at each receiver is then time reversed, i.e., last in first out, and used to estimate the propagation channel for either communication or imaging.  The predominance of ongoing work in time reversal methods has been directed towards acoustic point targets in low dimensions.  DARPA is interested in creating new technologies for exploiting the presence of multiple scattering in order to obtain high resolution imagery, enhanced communication bandwidth, and potentially covert communication channels.  We would like to invite white papers that are far reaching in their implications, innovative, and ambitious in their goals and implementation.  We encourage the submission of white papers and proposals that address one or more of the following areas: (1) Extension of time reversal methods from the acoustic to electromagnetic domain including the ability to treat three spatial and one temporal dimension, extended targets, and the effects of polarization in a wide variety of multipath environments including the presence of a spatially variable dielectric response.  This will require the creation and exploitation of new models, either statistical or deterministic, of the environment, electromagnetic simulations for the environment, and potentially experiments that validate the models and provide parameters for the models.  (2) Extension of time reversal methods as applied to acoustics to include the ability to treat three spatial and one temporal dimension as well as extended targets in a wide variety of acoustic environments including the presence of a spatially varying speed of sound.  This will require the creation and exploitation of new models, either statistical or deterministic, of the environment, electromagnetic simulations for the environment, and potentially experiments that validate the model and provide needed parameters for the models.  (3) Determination and quantification of the relationship between the amount of multipath and the maximal resolution of a target for the wavelength employed.  System studies that suggest how to modify existing sensors in light of the desired spatial resolution of the target, degree of multipath scattering, and detector noise, as well as suggesting collection strategies are further encouraged.  (4) Efforts that lead to an understanding of the portion of the received signal that should be sampled, sampling rates, the number of sensors that should be deployed, and the effects of the geometrical arrangement, and their effect on the theoretical resolution that can be obtained in the image.  (5) Strategies for exploiting existing and planned data collections from existing physical and synthetic electromagnetic (acoustic) sparse arrays; as well as LADAR systems to form images of targets in clutter using time reversal methods and comparisons of the utility of these images to images formed by conventional methods for automatic target cueing, identification, and recognition.  White papers whose focus is on automatic target cueing, identification, and recognition are strongly discouraged.  (6) New sensor concepts that exploit multipath that are capable of super resolution in the acoustic, sonar, or electromagnetic domains that support automatic target cueing, identification, and recognition.  (7) Mathematical analysis and demonstrations of time reversal methods to communication systems focusing on the characterization of the multipath, the maximum available bandwidth that is supported, methods for determining the number of transmitters required to provide spatial localization at the position of the receiver.  White papers addressing electromagnetic and acoustic communications are desired.  White papers may include any combinations of the above areas.  White papers with an emphasis on the development of mathematics and algorithms that enable time reversal methods coupled to simulations or experiments are preferred to white papers that focus on the design of sensors or data collection efforts as well as automatic target cueing, recognition, and identification.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams integrated toward solutions to these challenging problems.  It is essential that the preparation of white papers include the following areas: (1) A clear statement of the envisioned utility of the proposed research and development.  We are looking for revolutionary applications and goals that could be enabled if the proposed work is completed successfully.  While distinct goals for the execution of the proposal are required, the vision presented may extend past the performance period.  (2) A concise statement of the research challenges, approach, and potential anticipated solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This should include explicit timelines for which progress toward the goals can be determined and measured.  Intermediate milestones of approximately an 18 month-period with demonstrable metrics of performance must be included for the proposed work.  (3) A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed as well as funding.  A management plan that describes how the different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated is critical.  (4) The white paper should consider phases of development as the challenges are met.  The first phase of the program could include theoretical analysis demonstrating the efficacy of obtaining images by exploiting time reversal methods coupled to a demonstration based upon synthetic or real data that includes characterization of the environment.  White papers must be received by 1600 EDT March 14, 2003.  Please put the phrase TIME REVERSAL METHODS in the title of the white paper.  If the authors of white papers choose not to submit electronically, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.  Authors of white papers will be notified by April 14, 2003, if a full proposal will be requested.  Full proposals must be submitted no later than 1600 EDT May 14, 2003.  We expect to initiate new proposals expeditiously upon peer review.  To facilitate the submission of white papers, a website http://www.sainc.com/dso/ has been set up.  For more detailed instructions on submitting white papers, please refer to the instructions for BAA03-02 found at the website http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso/.  Not withstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative 18-month scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals, 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths, and 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects. Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically, and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program.  Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 18 months, but consideration should be given to possible continuation of the effort into Phase 2.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost.  The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 03-02 of December 16, 2002.  To receive consideration under this addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 EDT MAY 14, 2003, to the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA but not this addendum.  In addition to the required original and 5 copies of the proposal, proposers are required to submit an electronic copy of the proposal on a ZIP disk.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: Evaluation of the proposals will be in accordance with BAA03-02.  For general administrative questions, please refer to the original CBD announcement, BAA 03-02 of December 16, 2002.  GENERAL INFORMATION: In all correspondence, reference BAA03-02, Addendum 3.

<DESC>Synopsis is modified to change the following: Work shall be performed at the Marine Operations Center, 439 West York Street, Norfolk, Virginia 23510.  The period of performance is March 7, 2003 to April 4, 2003.  A prebid inspection will be held approximately February 24, 2003 in Norfolk, VA at the address shown above.  Appointments and arrangements for inspections can be made by contacting the COTR at 843-297-3426.  The government intends to conduct an on-line competitive best value reverse auction to be facilitated by a third-party reverse action provider, FedBid.com.  FedBid.com has developed an on-line , anonymous browser based application to conduct the reverse auction.  All functional specifications and drawings will be provided by FedBid.com.  The best value to the Government will be evaluated using price and other factors and will ultimately be determined offline.  Participants will submit a series of quotes that descend in price during the specified period of time.  All responsible small business sources may submit a quote/offer to the U.S. Dept. of Commerce using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com.  There is no cost to register, review procurement data, or make an offer on line for this requirement.  Offerors that are not currently registered to use FedBid.com Exchange should proceed to http://www.fedbid.com/selectvendor.jsp to complete their free registration.  Offerors that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Help Desk at 866-288-3535 or via email at ClientServices@FedBid.com.  The Government is taking this action in an effort to improve vendor quotes for products.  Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction by any means.  It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the bidding process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive bidding process.  The reverse auction will start on MONDAY, February 17, 2003 and end on Friday, February 28, 2003.

<DESC>Amendment 2 to Sources Sought Notice. Here are some additional questions received and our responses. 1) Are the two pulses 30 seconds apart or 30 seconds or less? Two pulses at 30 seconds apart. 2) Can lithium ion batteries be used on the submarine? There are existing Navy guidelines for use of Li ion batteries on submarines (Navy Technical manual S9310.SAF.010), however there is no current high power submarine application of Li ion batteries. It is a technology being explored for submarine use in several areas, but none have been fielded as of yet. 3) Does the power pulse, specified at 2 MW and 1 second, have a continuous 2 MW power draw for 1 second or does the power ramp up to 2 MW over 1 second? Alternately, specify the energy delivered to the load over the 1 second pulse if it is different than 2 MJ. The energy storage system should support a 2 MW continuous draw for 1 second, i.e. 2 MJ energy delivered. 4) In reference to the requirement to "be capable of remaining at a state of charge capable of supporting its duty cycle for its entire service life, or be capable of being charged to this level in less than 30 seconds." Does this mean that input power is not available during the periods when the system is not being used? Input power is available during periods where the system is not in use. The intent of this requirement is not to exclude a system that can not maintain itself in a state of charge for an indefinite period of time, but is capable of coming to full power in 30 seconds or less. 5) In reference to the requirement that "Recharging is not permitted during pulse discharge." The duty cycle is described as 2 pulses during a 30 second period, followed by 5 minutes of downtime. Does this recharging restriction above apply to the entire 30 second interval, or just to the 1 second pulse times? That is, can some level of recharging be done between the 1 second pulses? Recharging is only not permitted during the actual 1 second pulse. Recharging during the 30 second interval between pulses, or any other time that a pulse in not actually occurring is permitted. 6) Must the system be capable of recharging via both 700VDC and 450VAC or is the vendor free to select which input voltage the system will use, and restrict it to that type only? Vendor has the option to select between the two supply voltages. 7) Is the load truly a constant power load or is it a constant resistance? The requirement is equivalent to a step function for 1 second at a constant 2 MW. NAICS: 335911. There is no solicitation associated with this notice.

<DESC>The date for receipt of the responses to this Request for Information is extended until February 14, 2003.

This is a Request for Information for a Replacement Communications for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) United States Mission Control Center (USMCC).  
Background:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) manages the Nation's operational geostationary, and polar-orbiting environmental satellites, and manages a large collection of atmospheric, geophysical and oceanographic data.

Within NESDIS, the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) manages and directs the operation of the central ground facilities which ingest, process, and distribute environmental satellite data and derived products to domestic and foreign users.  The Direct Services Division of the OSDPD manages and operates the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program.  The SARSAT program and system are part of the international Cospas-Sarsat System which is an international system designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate the signals of distress beacons operating on 406 Megahertz (MHz) or 121.5 MHz.   The position of the distress and other related information is forwarded by the responsible Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Center (MCC) to the appropriate SAR authorities.

Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.   MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam.  

Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas-sarsat.org/  and
http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/ .

The United States Mission Control Center (USMCC) is located in Suitland, MD.. The USMCC exchanges 1) non-alert system information directly with each of the other MCCs and 2) alert information through the Cospas-Sarsat nodal network.   X.25 via Packet Switched Data Networks (PSDNs) provided by WorldCom and SPRINT has been the primary means for the exchange of non-alert and alert information between the USMCC and other MCCs.  As a matter of fact, X.25 via PSDNs has evolved to be the principal means of data communications among all the MCCs within Cospas-Sarsat.   Direct links from the USMCC to the PSDNs of WorldCom and SPRINT as well as  the international X.75 gateways provided by WorldCom and SPRINT.   It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs is low and 56 kbps links are more than sufficient.           

Problem Statement

As a member of the Cospas-Sarsat program involved in satellite-aided search and rescue, the USMCC  uses an X.25 based network as its primary means for sending and receiving data internationally on emergency beacon activations.  The USMCC  currently communicates with  MCCs in 23 countries via X.25 . Countries and locations appear below: 
ALMCC  Algiers, Algeria; ITMCC Bari, Italy; ARMCC  Ezeiza, Argentina; JAMCC Tokyo, Japan;  ASMCC Cape Town, South Africa;  KOMCC Daejeon, R. of Korea, AUMCC Canberra, Australia;  NMCC Bodoe, Norway;  BRMCC Brasilia, Brazil;	PAMCC Lahore, Pakistan; CHMCC	Santiago, Chile; PEMCC Callao, Peru; CMC Moscow, Russia; SAMCC Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; CMCC Trenton, Canada; SIMCC Singapore, Singapore; CNMCC Beijing, P. R. of China; SPMCC	Maspalomas, Spain;
FMCC  Toulouse, France;  TAMCC	ITDC/Taipei MCC;  HKMCC  Hong Kong, China;	UKMCC  Kinloss, UK;  IDMCC  Jakarta, Indonesia.


Under the FTS 2001 contract both WorldCom and SPRINT have announced the termination of their respective PSDNs between December 2002 and June 2003.   It should be noted that AT&T terminated their PSDN in December 1999.  Although the USMCC utilizes the PSDN of WorldCom under a contract that expires in October 2005, the future commercial availability of PSDNs and associated X.75 gateways in the United States appears bleak   As noted in the Background,  X.25 via PSDNs has evolved to become the primary data communications means within Cospas-Sarsat.  It is not known at this time what the future holds for PSDNs in the other countries that have Cospas-Sarsat MCCs.  Because of the number of countries involved and the management structure of Cospas-Sarsat, it is estimated that it would take Cospas-Sarsat 6-8 years to completely transition to another primary means of data communications .  

The Needed Information:

The primary purpose of this RFI is the acquisition of information including estimated costs  that shows an alternative X.75 gateway, either in the United States or another country, that  can be accessed to allow the USMCC to continue X.25 data communications until at least 2010.   

The secondary purpose of this RFI is the acquisition of information concerning data communications methods other than X.25/PSDNs that could  be considered future candidates for the primary data communications method within Cospas-Sarsat.  Appendix A provides a set of high level requirements for an international communications network.

APPENDIX A: Communications System Requirements

Reliable
The communications service shall be provided 24 hours-per-day on a continuous basis.  The service must be relatively error-free and reliable and must have an error transmission rate of one in ten billion or less. 

The communications service shall have an operational availability of 99.5% or greater calculated for each calendar day.  All preventive maintenance shall be transparent to the Government.  Any interruption of service shall be treated as an outage.

The communications service shall provided a timely method of delivery failure notification to the USMCC. 

Maximize single transmission size limitations

The typical single message size transmitted between MCCs is 256 bytes.  However, the communications service shall allow for individual message size up to at least 25,000 characters and ensure that message content shall not be modified.

The communications service shall also handle text format using International Alphabet #5 (IA5) representation. 

Globally accessible

The communications service shall be globally accessible allowing NOAA to easily add communication sites (e .g., Vietnam, Greece, and Nigeria will be added in the next year.).  The service shall also allow NOAA to easily remove or modify communication sites.

Responsive maintenance

Due to the critical nature of the information to be disseminated, the contractor shall provide a single point of contact for trouble reporting and provide 24-hour trouble support with a response time not to exceed two (2) hours.  The USMCC shall be notified at least 48 hours in advance of any unavoidable, scheduled outage.

The communications service shall provide for automatic rerouting of messages within network to eliminate single points of failure within the cloud. 

The communications service shall provide circuit status confirmation and provide a timely method of receipt verification.


Security

The communications service shall provide the resources to ensure that inbound traffic is restricted to authorized call-ins designated by the USMCC and all inbound traffic is authenticated using parameters such as calling address, called address and call user data.

Cost Effective

<DESC>NA US Army Communications-Electronics Command, CECOM Acquisition Center Washington, ATTN: AMSEL-AC-W, 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22331-0700 is performing market research on behalf of the US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM), RD&E Cen ter, Command and Control Directorate, Army Power Division, Power Generation Branch, Fort Belvoir, VA.  The CECOM Power Generation Branch  is searching for sources  for Research and Development (R&D) approaches to reduce the system weight and the external n oise output on Department of Defense (DoD) 2 kW Military Tactical Generator (MTG) sets (models MEP-501A and MEP-531A).  The 2 kW MTG is an open frame power unit that is equipped with a Yanmar model L48AE-DEG, one-cylinder, air-cooled diesel engine to provi de 2 kW of power at either 120 volts, 60 Hertz AC or 28 volts DC, using different generator and control elements.  The wet weight of the 2 kW MTG is 158 pounds for the AC unit and 138 pounds for the DC unit.  Both generator units emit a noise signature of 79 dBA @ 7 meters.  Additional information and photos of the sets are available at http://www.pmmep.org/technicaldata/2kw.htm.  CECOM is interested in pursuing R&D approaches that will reduce the system weight of both the AC and DC generator sets by 20% to  25%.  CECOM is also interested in pursuing R&D approaches that will reduce the aural signature of both existing units to 70 dBA @ 7 meters.  Each technical objective will be reviewed independently to identify the potential for noise and weight reductions.   In addition, a third effort will be conducted on both technical objectives to identify the potential for concurrent weight and noise reductions.  R&D changes applied to the 2 kW MTG to meet these new performance requirements must not impact the systems ability to comply with current military requirements for EMI per MIL-STD 461; Environmental Capabilities such as operation from 25 F to 120 F, rain, humidity, altitude, sand/dust, rail transport, -65 F cold storage, salt spray and fungus; Electric Pow er Rating: 2 kW, 1.0 pf @ 4000 ft/120 F, derate 3.5%/1000 ft (4000 - 8000 ft), max power rating at 110%; and all Electric Power Quality requirements.  Investigations will be conducted for the purpose of developing a field kit that can be procured and inst alled at the Unit Level.  Therefore, installation costs will be a factor in this R&D design approach.  There is no funding or plans to apply the results of this R&D effort to the current production of the 2 KW MTG.   The DOD has no future plans to produce the 2 KW MTG beyond the existing production contract.   CECOM is interested in obtaining white papers, not exceeding 10 pages in length, describing the contractors experience with design, development, fabrication and testing of the DoD 2 kW MTG, organizat ional capabilities, and technical approaches to pursue R&D objectives to reduce system noise and weight on the 2 kW MTG, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost to execute this R&D program.   Funds have been authorized and appropriated for the R&D effort , however CECOM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited herein.  The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements.  It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government.  However, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.  If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestri cted information as an addendum.   All responses to this market research shall be submitted within 21 calendar days of the date of this announcement.  Responses must be submitted via electronic mail to Ms. Patricia Davis, Contracting Officer at pat.davis@c acw.army.mil.   Questions pertaining to this announcement may also be submitted via email to Ms. Davis. No telephonic questions or requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Department of Transportation (DOT), Transportation Administrative Services Center (TASC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to support its drug-and alcohol-free workplace program.  Sources will provide urine collection for drug testing and breath alcohol testing services and supporting functions in accordance with Executive Order 12564 and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and any other related services to support the DOT Drug-Free Workplace Program.  In addition, similar services for certain other Federal, state, and local government agencies or entities are required under this contract.  Collection/testing is required in over 750 duty locations throughout the centennial 50 States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and certain locations in the Western Pacific Area.  Release of the solicitation is planned for April, 2003.  Award of a firm-fixed-priced contract by August 15, 2003 (to effect a 45 day transition period) with a base year (commencing October 1, 2003) and 4 option years is anticipated.  A decision on the acquisition approach (i.e., full and open competition versus an 8(a) or other set-aside competition) has not been made; a pre-solicitation synopsis will be issued once a determination has been made.  The solicitation will ultimately be distributed electronically via the Government?s electronic posting Web site at http://www.eps.gov under the Department of Transportation, Acquisition Services so FIRMS SHOULD NOT RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE BY REQUESTING TO BE PLACED ON A SOLICITATION MAILING LIST. 

The estimated number of DOT employee collections/tests to be performed is approximately 10,000 collections a year for drug testing and 5,000 alcohol tests with a peak in any month of approximately 1000 drug and 500 alcohol tests.  The rate of random testing in the DOT workforce is subject to change.  The actual number of tests to be performed each year will vary depending upon such factors as random testing rate, volume of testing other than random, as well as testing that may be required to support non-DOT agencies that are customers of TASC.  Services are required on a 24-hour, 7-day a week basis.  A responsive emergency service is required.  In FY2002, over 130 emergency collections/test events were required.  The Contractor shall comply with any applicable Government wide standards, DOT regulations, and other related procedures, particularly in providing collectors and alcohol testing technicians qualified under 49CFR Part 40 regulations.  In addition to workload and invoicing reports, DOT may require electronic scheduling and reporting of completed work.

The testing component requires a complex scheduling, testing, monitoring, and reporting process and must be consistent at every location (i.e., same kits, forms, equipment, procedures etc.).  The contractor shall participate with DOT in this effort by assisting, in a flexible and responsive manner, in establishing and modifying procedures required and assuring a high quality of performance.  Specific procedures may differ for the customers of TASC, from the procedures defined in the various DOT regulations for the drug and alcohol testing of transportation industry employees.  Also, procedures are, under certain circumstances, subject to collective bargaining of covered employees of DOT or other participating entities.  The full impact of other entities participating in this contract cannot be estimated at this time.

TASC reserves the right to include any work related to substance abuse testing, related awareness and employee/supervisor training, program design and/or advisory services which may be necessary.  This includes, but is not limited to Medical Review Officer services, alternative specimen collection/testing and alternative testing technologies.

Sources interested in this requirement should provide a brief description, not to exceed 10 pages, of previous experience performing contracts comparable to these services over the past three years.  The description of previous experience must include for each contract the contract number, dollar value, customer, name and telephone number of the customer point of contact, and a summary level description of the work performed.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, is not a notice of a solicitation, and does not constitute a Government agreement to contract.  Sources must indicate whether they are a large, small or 8(a), HUBZone business under NAICS 62199.  The Government does not intend to pay for information furnished in response hereto.  Large business, small and disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to team in their national effort to support one master DOT contract.  Responses are required by 3:00 pm on February 19, 2003 and should be submitted via electronic mail to theresta.lanier@ost.dot.gov.  NOTE hand-carried responses will not be accepted but faxed responses can be faxed to 202-366-9848.

<SUBJECT>D -- Planned 8PSK Mod Upgrade for NOAA POES Environmental Data Users
<DESC>The following is a "special notice" issued in accordance with the FAR at Sub-Part 5.205(c), entitled, "8 PSK Modem Requirement Announcement".  The purpose of this notice is to inform the widest possible audience of planned changes to satellite broadcast data from Americom Government Service's (AGS) (formerly GE Americom) telecommunications satellites, formerly known as GE-4 and GE-2 (now AGS-4 and AGS-2).  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) data is transmitted through these commercial satellites.  Recipients of environmental data from NOAA's POES satellites that receive direct broadcast data from AGS' telecommunications satellites will require 8 Phase Shift Key  (8 PSK) modulation with Reed Solomon coding; either 2/3 or 5/6 FEC Coding, and Reed Solomon outer coding features in their modems in order to continue to receive this data.  This upgrade/conversion to 8 PSK modulation is planned for early 2003.  NOAA awarded the Converged POES/DMSP Telecommunications support contract (Number 50-DGNE-2-90011) to the incumbent Americom Government Services (AGS) on July 31, 2002.  This contract's period of performance began on September 6, 2002 and, if all options are exercised by the Government, will continue to provide satellite communications for up to 10 years.  Technology improvements provided by the new AGS contract included the conversion from QPSK modulation to 8 Phase Shift Key (PSK) modulation.   The use of 8PSK modulation will result in more efficient satellite transponder use and lower costs to the Government.  You may contact NOAA Integrated Program Office employees Jay Moore (contracting officer) at 301-427-2079, ext. 112, or Clarence Tignor (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative) at 301-427-2079, ext. 217, if you need additional information, or if you need to contact AGS with any questions.

<SUBJECT>A -- Trial of vitamin E versus an insulin-sensitizing agent versus placebo in patients with well-characterized nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
<DESC>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to implement a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter clinical trial of vitamin E versus an insulin-sensitizing agent versus placebo in patients with well characterized nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including  both children and adults.  A retrospective and prospective database of adult and pediatric cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease will also be created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded NASH Clinical Research Network that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large group of patients.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease also pose opportunities for CRADAs.             SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to provide insulin-sensitizing agents, Vitamin E and placebo to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial of therapy of  NASH.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a CRADA to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or NASH. 

	Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to provide insulin sensitizing agent(s) such as biguanides or thiazolidinediones, Vitamin E and placebo to study important issues regarding possible treatment options and disease progression in NASH.  The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of NASH and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels of the vitamin E and/or insulin sensitizing agent (s), pharmacokinetics, and drug distribution methodology.  In addition, CRADA partners are being sought for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include: 

1)	The identification of host genetic factors associated with the development of NASH and with the risk of fibrosis progression. This will involve the analysis of genomic DNA from individuals with NASH as well as NAFLD for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in prioritized candidate genes, which have been identified using a combination of literature search and informatic algorithms including biologic mechanisms, pathogenesis, linkage analysis and biochemical studies.

2)	Exploration of serum markers for fibrosis to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.

3)	Evaluation of the role of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and analysis of the effect of various therapies on the levels of serum and urine peroxides in patients with NAFLD participating in treatment trials.

4)	Develop gene expression arrays that are diagnostic of fatty liver disease and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, steatosis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.

5)	Use of cytokine assays for analyses of serum/plasma cytokine levels as markers of necro-inflammatory or fibrotic activity in NASH and as surrogate markers of histologic improvement in therapeutic trials of NASH.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. It is not a grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and may contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.

	Study Goal:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with NASH using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of NASH and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database on adult and pediatric patients with NASH and NAFLD including clinical information as well as serum and tissue samples.  In addition, the NASH Clinical Research Network will conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of promising therapies for NASH, including use of an insulin-sensitizing agent (such as a biguanide or thiazolidinedione) and/or an anti-oxidant (such as vitamin E) compared to placebo.    
Applicants for a CRADA to support this clinical trial must include a description of investigators and staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies to assess patients with NAFLD and NASH.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the pharmacokinetics of the proposed drugs to be used including how and when the drugs should be taken.  The process for biologic sample collection, storage and handling needs must be included.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed including assays to determine specific drug levels along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria: 
1.	The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized in the investigation of an insulin-sensitizing agent or vitamin E in patients with NASH and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease progression in these patients.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the therapeutic agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study. 
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to therapeutic treatment and evaluation of NAFLD or NASH, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.
4.	The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results and ability to be bound by PHS intellectual property policies (see CRADA:  http://ott.od.nih.gov/newpages/crada.pdf).

DATES:  Only written CRADA capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before March 5, 2003 will be considered.   Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicants own expense to discuss with the Study Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study's Steering Committee on or about March 18, 2003.

     - Outreach to strategic and corporate partners for sponsorship and in-kind support, maximizing the use of volunteers.
     - Close communications and partnering with the current Foundation-contracted events planner and public relations firm and the Archivist's staff to ensure the seamless coordination of all events.
     - While the Government expects that most participants and vendors will be unpaid volunteers, if contracts are required, perform detailed market research and recommend suppliers and vendors to the NARA contracting activity while ensuring timely completion of contracted events.
     -  At the completion of this project, the events planner must provide a summary report, which will also serve as the basis for final payment. 
Details:
- Fifty years ago, on December 15, 1952, the most sacred documents of our history, the Charters of Freedom - the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights were formally enshrined in the National Archives. On July 4, 2001, access to the Charters and to the Rotunda was halted as extensive restoration and renovation projects began.
- The National Archives will unveil the newly restored Charters of Freedom at a rededication ceremony at the National Archives on September 17, 2003, Constitution Day.  This is the first in a series of events culminating in the opening of the National Archives Experience in July 2004.  Events marking the return of the Charters will take place the week prior, during, and after the rededication.
- Planned events include:
? September 6th - Saturday (or sooner depending on media stops). Copies of the Charters of Freedom begin the journey by horseback from Philadelphia to their resting place in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom. Assuming progress of about 15 miles a day, the Charters would be scheduled to arrive at the National Archives on Tuesday, September 16th.  [Planner would be required to work with NARA to determine route of the journey, solicit participation from equestrian groups, work with PR firm to coordinate services of local police departments, media, veterinary services (if needed), State Governors, District government regarding route and road closures, etc.]
? September 12th - Friday. This day would be set aside for the day-long preview of the Rotunda and Charters of Freedom by NARA staff. College Park, Federal Register and Washington National Records Center (WNRC) staff would be bused to the National Archives Building. [Although this event would be coordinated by NARA staff, the planner would serve as an advisor.]
? September 16th - Tuesday.  The copies of the Charters of Freedom arrive at the National Archives Building by horseback, with full military pomp and circumstance. The Charters are ceremoniously carried up the steps and delivered to the Archivist at the bronze doors entrance. Once the Archivist receives and carries them inside the Rotunda, a military honor guard assumes its post at the doors. It will remain in place until the formal reopening the morning of the 17th. Once night falls on the 16th, bathe the bronze doors and honor guard in spotlights shining up the ceremonial steps.  [Planner would be required to plan the day's events including working with the District government regarding route and road closures, permission for evening spotlights, coordinating with the Military Commander for the District of Columbia to acquire the services of the U.S. military (bands, color guards, etc.), etc.] 
? September 17th - Wednesday. The Charters of Freedom recognize and delineate our rights as Americans. That should be the theme for the day. As such, let's recognize and celebrate those whose efforts to ensure those rights came before us - a group of veterans; those who protect our rights today - a contingent of soldiers representative of the color and gender of our Armed Forces; those who teach our rights as Americans - a group of teachers, one from every school jurisdiction in the metropolitan area; and those who are just learning about their rights - a group of schoolkids, again, one from each school jurisdiction.
- Also invited to attend the Rotunda reopening will be former Presidents of the United States, the Mayor of Washington, National Archives Foundation Board members and special invitees, and senior NARA staff. Others to be invited as space allows. Adequate space must be retained for the media. 
- At the official opening of the Rotunda invited participants include the President of the United States and Mrs. Bush, former Presidents including Nancy Reagan representing President Reagan, Lady Bird Johnson, the Chief Justice of the United States, the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, and the Governors of the first 13 states enter the Rotunda. All are greeted by the Archivist. This event should be broadcast and shown on the Internet.
- The ceremony should take about an hour. Upon conclusion, the Rotunda and galleries would be made available to the media for tours, interviews, film set ups, etc. [Planner would be required to work with NARA on obtaining approval from the District government on possible road closures, permission to use a video wall on the steps of Constitution Ave., coordinate with Military Commander on obtaining military bands and color guards, advising NARA on proper protocol for invited dignitaries, etc.]
- September 18th - 21th.  The 18th should serve as the Grand Reopening to the Public day with special public activities through the 21st.  [Planner would assist NARA in all logistics pertaining to the reopening to the public; short welcoming speech by the Archivist; explore cost and acquisition of commemorative souvenir for opening day visitors; coordinate media coverage.]
 - Week of September 22nd - Education Week. Invite 3rd or 4th grade students or other appropriate grades from all area jurisdictions - D.C., Montgomery, Prince Georges, Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax counties. Students and their teachers would be given guided tours of the Rotunda, educational packets, and a small remembrance of their visit.  [Planner would assist NARA in logistics pertaining to Education Week.]

FEDERAL RECORDS CENTER LADDER SPECIFICATION

Ladder, Aluminum, Rolling Platform/Pulpit Type

1. GENERAL.  This purchase description covers a special aluminum rolling platform ladder, with pulpit, designed for manual movement on concrete floors within 36-inch nominal width service aisles in shelving installations with 15-box-high storage at Federal Records Centers (FRCs).

1.1 MODEL.  The ladder shall be a 9-step model conforming in all respects to this 
description.

2. DESIGN.  A manufacturer?s  tolerance of plus or minus 1/8th inch shall be permitted
for all ladder measurements identified herein as the ones critical to records center operations.
 
2.1  STEPS.  With the exception of the top platform step, all ladder steps shall be not less 
       than 9 inches or more than 10 inches deep by not more than 1 inch thick (including 
       the tread).  The  distance between the steps, measured from top surface to top             
       surface, shall be 12 inches.  This uniform spacing provides 11 inches of clear vertical
       space between the steps, and allows each step to serve as a ?shelf? to access files
       housed in standard-size FRC boxes 10 inches high.  The top platform step shall be 14
       inches deep by 1 inch thick.  The width of the steps shall conform to the  taper of the
       sides of the ladder (see Drawing 2).  The  thickness, depth, and spacing 
       measurements of the steps are specified as critical to records center operations.

2.2 PULPIT FILING SHELF.  The filing shelf shall be fabricated from aluminum
sheet, 1/8th inch nominal thickness, and shall have a flat, smooth top surface.  Its
size shall be 12 inches deep by 21 inches wide by 1 inch thick.  It shall be mounted
permanently on the upper guardrail and shall overlap the top step by no more than 3
inches.

2.3 SWIVEL CASTERS.  Each ladder requires four spring-loaded swivel casters with
3-inch diameter wheels.  The casters shall conform to Bassick caster model number
WL13698MX282RP or equal.  Casters shall have a bolt, rivet, or bushing axle.  They
shall be in suitable housing welded to the ladder frame, fully operational, in a manner that permits caster replacements using simple hand tools.  The stem of each caster shall be mounted so that when a user?s weight is applied to any step, the springs on all four casters shall compress, allowing all four legs of the ladder to rest on the floor.

2.4 HOUSING FOR CASTER SHAFT AND SPRING.  The cited Bassick caster is 
without shaft housing and spring.  Housing for the caster shaft and spring may be fabricated from aluminum pipe of ? inch nominal diameter.  The housing shall be welded to the ladder frame.  The caster springs shall be designed so that when the ladder is unloaded they shall have sufficient force to return the ladder to the raised mobile position.  The spring shall have a fatigue life cable of withstanding a minimum of one million full cycles of ladder deflections.              

2.5 BRACKET FOR SHAFT HOUSING.  The shaft housing for each caster shall be reinforced with a 1/8 inch thick formed angular aluminum bracket welded to the shaft housing and frame of the ladder at the intersection of the front and back base across braces.

2.6 GUIDE ROLLERS.  Four rigid guide rollers are required for each ladder. The guide 
roller wheels shall be mounted on custom-made, aluminum, angular, brackets that will also serve as axle housing for the wheels.  Welded to the four corners at the base of the ladder, the bracket shall be aluminum 3/8 of an inch thick, 2-1/2 inches wide, and project 2-1/2 inches from the base of the ladder to the furthermost point of the bracket.  The bracket shall be tapered at the corners of the ladder, and shall provide housing for both ends of the axles of the guide roller wheels.

2.7 BRACKETS.  The guide roller brackets shall be welded to the ladder at the outer corners of the base at both the ladder end and at the non-ladder end.  The weld shall be 2-1/2 inches wide to match the width of the bracket and must be strong enough to withstand repetitive bumping of  uprights within rows of installed steel shelving.  Each ladder shall have two guide roller assemblies (one on each corner) at the ladder end and two guide roller assemblies (one at  each corner) at the non-ladder end.

2.8 WHEELS.   The  guide roller assemblies shall have 2-inch  diameter wheels of hard rubber composition.  The wheel thickness shall be 3/4th  of an inch, plus or minus 1/8th of an inch.  Oval head bolts with special self-locking type nuts shall be used as axles.  The lock nuts shall be installed on the down side of the customized housing bracket.  With the ladder in the raised position (unloaded), the topmost point of the axle oval head shall not be more than 2-3/4th  inches above the floor surface.  This limitation allows the guide assemblies to roll along the bases of installed shelving and not damage the boxed records stored on the bottom shelves at 3 inches above the floor surface.  The 2-3/4th inch high measurement is critical to records center operations.  The overall 34-inch width of the guide rollers, is specified in order to meet critical operational tracking movement of the ladders within 36-inch nominal width service aisles.

2.9  BRACES AT LADDER BASE.  To strengthen the ladder, three aluminum pipes, approximately 27 inches long each, shall be welded across the frame of the ladder at its base.  These pipes shall be welded at the following approximate locations: (1) across at the center of the ladder, (2) indented 8 inches from the ladder end (at the front swivel casters), and (3) indented 8 inches from the non-ladder end (at the back swivel casters).

3. COSTRUCTION.  As a minimum, the ladder shall be capable of safely sustaining two individuals with a combined weight of 400 pounds plus a 50 percent overload factor.  Each step shall be capable of supporting 200 pounds plus a 50 percent overload factor.  The pulpit file shelf shall be capable of supporting 60 pounds plus a 50 percent overload factor.

3.1 METHOD.  The ladder shall be all-welded construction and shall be furnished fully assembled for immediate use.

4. MATERIALS.  The ladder frame, rails, and diagonals shall be ?-inch nominal pipe size, schedule 40 aluminum pipe (or ?-inch pipe size at the manufacture?s option).  Aluminum shall be of alloys 6061,6063, of a T4 , T5 or T6 temper at the manufacture?s option.

4.1 STEPS.  All steps shall be fabricated from aluminum, of 1/8th inch nominal thickness.  The step treads shall be corrugated, ribbed, dimpled, embossed, knurled, or other non-slip configuration except serrated.  Step thickness overall shall not exceed one inch.

4.2 PULPIT FILING SHELF.  The pulpit/filing shelf at the top of the ladder shall be fabricated from aluminum sheet, 1/8th inch nominal thickness, and shall have a flat, smooth top surface.

4.3 LEGS.  All legs of the ladder shall be equipped with reinforced rubber tips to prevent it from rolling when loaded.

5. FINISH.  The aluminum finish shall be the manufacture?s standard mill unpainted finish and shall be free from burrs, sharp edges, and oily substances.

6. STEP SPACING.  The top surface of the bottom step shall be 12 inches above the floor when the ladder is in the down position (loaded).  The distance between shelves shall be 12-inch nominal measurement from top surface to top surface.  The clear vertical space between the steps(11-inch nominal measurement) is critical to records center operations.  Step overlap shall be approximately 5 inches.

7. INSPECTION.  Prior to payment, all ladders must meet the requirements of this purchase description, with inspection to be performed FOB destination unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer of the National Archives and Records Administration.

8. PACKAGING.  Packaging shall be in a manner that prevent damage to the ladders during shipment, including damage to the guide rollers, casters, steps, filing shelf, legs, frame rails, diagonals, finish, etc.

9. DELIVERY.  Delivery requirements shall be FOB destination unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer of the National Archives and Records Administration.  Ladders are to be deliver no later than 3 weeks after award to: National Archives and Records Administration, 8801 Kingsridge Drive, Dayton, OH  45458.
