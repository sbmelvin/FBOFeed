<DESC>SJSC Uzbekenergo invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for the rehabilitation of Units 5 and 6 of the Syrdarya Power Plant in Uzbekistan.

The Syrdarya power plant is Uzbekistan's largest power plant, accounting for approximately one third of Uzbekistan's power generation.  It has ten units of 300 MWe each, commissioned between 1972 and 1981. On April 4, 1998, a blade of Unit 5's LP36 stage broke and destroyed the LP cylinder. The damage is such that the entire LP cylinder needs to be replaced. Unit 6 is currently in operation, but its output is substantially below design value. 

The facilities require rehabilitation with more efficient and environmentally friendly equipment, so that they can operate reliably at their design capacities with reduced impact on the environment.  There are currently no manufacturing facilities in the country for the production of major equipment used in power generation and transmission.

Uzbekistan is a member of the Central Asia Power System (CAPS), which was developed when the country was part of the Soviet Union.  CAPS's Unified Dispatch Center is located in Tashkent, and is responsible for maintaining the balanced and synchronized operation of the transmission and distribution systems of the five Central Asian countries which constitute the CAPS.  Transmission links at 110 kV, 220 kV and 500 kV connect the power systems of southern Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Growing demand for electric energy and deterioration of the existing generating facilities motivated the Government of Uzbekistan to develop a program for rehabilitation and development of the sector for the period 2001-2010.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $225,000 grant to SJSC Uzbekenergo from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to SJSC Uzbekenergo c/oTDA by 4:00 P.M. August 15, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  SJSC Uzbekenergo reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  SJSC Uzbekenergo also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  SJSC Uzbekenergo is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Offeror should specify a unit price under this option, and be capable of delivering up to ten additional units. This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government.  BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of  Simplified Acquisition Procedures and predefines the value characteristics which will serve as the discriminators among offers. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the offeror with the lowest evaluated price.  However, the Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. The specifications included in the solicitation serve as the Government's baseline requirements.  The following value characteristics establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer.  These value characteristics are performance based and permit selection of the offer which provides better results for a reasonable marginal increase in price.  All offers will be judged against these value characteristics.  Price and technical (including past performance) factors will be considered equal in importance and will not be assigned weights.  On those value characteristics the offeror chooses to provide, adequate information should be submitted to permit proper evaluation. The following value characteristics are applicable to this procurement: 1. The offer demonstrates a credible approach to accelerate the contract delivery schedule.  It is in the Government's best interest to take delivery of the required deliverable items earlier than the dates specified 2. The offer specifies a technical solution that is state-of-the-art yet reliable.  It is in the Government's best interest to receive the latest hardware that will be reliable in an operational environment. 3. The offer specifies the Warranty Features, such as 1 year, 3 year, on-site cold spares, expedient replacement of parts, etc.  It is in the government's best interest to have the most expedient equipment repair, e.g. on-site vendor-supplied cold spares or expedient advanced (i.e. vendor to send out replacement before defective part is returned) delivery of replacement parts for up to 3 years. 4. The offer identifies previous experience with similar Beowulf system design and integration efforts.  This experience shall be described as part of the relevant contract performance information.  It is in the Government's best interest to select a Contractor with previous experience that relates to performance under this intended contract. 5. The offer specifies a cost-effective technical solution for all of the Basic Requirements and for the Contract Options.  It is in the Government's best interest to get a cost-competitive proposal. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 97-26. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.

The authorizing legislation is the Small Business Act, subsection 2(h) and 29, 15 U.W.C. subsection 631 (h) and 656.  Approximately (3) grants will be awarded.
A Women's Business Center is a 5 year community-based project that is funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration through a matching grant.  The project is a planned scope of activites that provide business skills services targeted to women.  The project must operate as a distinct unit of the recipient's organization having its own budget for facilities, equipment and resources to carry out project activities.  The WBC services must include lon-term training and counseling pertaining to financial, management and marketing assistance to benefit small business concerns owned and controlled by women.
The application period will be from July 18, 2002 to August 15, 2002.  SBA Headquarters must receive applications/proposals by 4:00p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on the application closing date of August 15, 2002.  SBA will determine the successful applicant using a competitive technical evaluation process.  Applicants from states and territories without an SBA funded Women's Business Center will receive special consideration.  States and U.S. territories without a center are Delaward, Guam, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia.
Service and assistance areas must include financial, managment, marketing, loan packaging, eCommerce and government procurement/certification assistance.  Applicants must plan to include women who are socially and economically disadvantaged in the target group.  The applicant may propose specialized services that will assist women in Empowerment Zones, women who are veterans, women with disabilities, women with home-based businesses, women in agribusiness, or women in rural or urban areas.  SBA will require award recipients to provide content and support to the SBA-funded Online Women's Business Center (www.onlinewbc.gov) and provide training on the business uses of the Internet.
Each applicant must submit a five-year plan that describes proposed fund-raising, training and technical assistance activities.  A center may receive financial assistance through a five-year term without re-competition.  However, the award will be issued annually for each 12-month budget project.
Award recipients must provide non-Federal matching funds as follows: one non-Federal dollar for each two Federal dollars in years 1 and 2; and one non-Federal dollar for each Federal dollar in years 3, 4, and 5.  Up to one-half of the non-Federal match funds may be in the form of in-kind contributions (i.e., 50% of match must be in cash).

The General Services Administration (GSA, Region 9, San Francisco) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture and is seeking an Architect-Engineering (A-E) design team to design a new Border Patrol Station in the vicinity of Chula Vista/San Diego (Otay Mesa) California. The new facility will be comprised of several structures, totaling approximately 73,000 gross square feet (6,862 GSM) on a nearly 20 acre commercial site.  The structures will include a 57,100 sf Station Building, a 15,000 sf Vehicle Repair/Electronics Facility, 1000 sf dog kennel, 3,500 sf enclosed parking/vehicle storage, as well as washing and fueling facilities for vehicles.  Additionally, the site must be designed to accommodate approximately 750 parking spaces.  The estimated total cost for construction is $10,000,000 to $15,000,000.  The scope of A-E Services for this Firm Fixed-Price Contract may include but is not limited to the following: pre-design programming; site investigation (including geo-technical surveys and analyses, topographical and boundary surveys), design concepts, complete architectural and engineering design services, preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents, cost estimating, space planning, exterior and landscape design, comprehensive interior design, value engineering, post construction phase services, and other related supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  The project will be delivered either through Design-Build or the traditional Design-Bid-Build process.  Base services will likely include associated design efforts up through Bridging Documents (approximately 50% Construction Documents).  Dependant upon the final procurement strategy selected, the Government may exercise the option for the A/E to proceed with 100% Construction Documents, as well as assist in the bidding and construction phases.

The A-E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:  

STAGE I:  This phase will establish the Design Excellence capabilities of the A-E design firm and its lead designer. The ?lead designer? is the individual of design studio who will have the primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the building?s architecture. This individual or studio is employed by the ?A-E design firm?, that is, the A-E firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, which will have contractual responsibility for the project design. In the first stage, a short list of a minimum of three (3) Architect-Engineer firms will be selected based upon the firms' submittals in response to this Request for Qualifications (RFQ).  Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the evaluation criteria listed below.  In addition, the A-E design firm shall submit a firm profile that is no longer than two (2) typewritten pages that describes the overall history of the firm, general design philosophy to projects, and the firm?s organizational make-up that supports the design process.  The A-E firm shall also submit a typewritten description (maximum two pages) and relevant 8-1/2? x 11? graphics (maximum three per project) of up to five (5) comparable building design projects completed within the last ten years. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project and discuss how the clients? design, economic, and operational objectives were satisfied by the design.  The following items will serve as EVALUATION CRITERIA in order of importance:

(1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN:  The A-E design firm shall submit a portfolio of up to five outstanding projects completed by the firm within the past ten years.  Include a maximum of two typewritten pages per project describing design objectives, approach, results, project significance, key features, and awards and up to three illustrations (no larger than 8-inches by 10-inches each) for each project to indicate visual evidence of design quality. 
(2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT: The A-E design firm shall submit a statement of intent, written by the lead designer in a maximum of two (2) typewritten pages, indicating overall design philosophy, understanding of design issues, and approaches and solutions applicable to this project. 
(3) LEAD DESIGNER(S) PORTFOLIO(S):  Submit a description of two (2) designs completed within the past 10 years by each lead designer (maximum of one page per project).  Narratives shall include a discussion of the design challenges and solutions.  A maximum of three (3) illustrations no larger than 8-by-10 inches for each project can be included.
(4) LEAD DESIGNER(S) PROFILE(S):  Submit biographical sketch(es) including education, professional experience, and recognition of design efforts inclusive of examples for the lead designer(s) and other key individuals, including the design principal, project designer and project manager. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to this project. 

The primary goal of this project is to develop an award-winning design that meets the project programming and budget parameters of the client agency.  In addition, appropriate and cost-effective integration of sustainable design principles will be required.  Formal LEED certification (as outlined by the U.S. Green Building Council) may be pursued, dependent upon the project budget.  Nonetheless, LEED 2.0 criteria will still be used as one of the tools in developing a successful design solution for this project.  Therefore, in addition to aesthetic design excellence; the demonstration of successful integration of sustainable practices will also be evaluated.

STAGE II: In this stage, the entire project team, including each A-E design firm selected in Stage I, its designated lead designer, and all the consultants who will work on the project will be interviewed and evaluated. The short listed A-E design firms will submit Standard Forms 254 and 255 for the entire project team for the final selection process.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A-E design firms to establish project teams. In developing the project team required for Stage II, A-E firms are advised that a majority development of contract effort must be performed within the area of geographical limitation defined as the State of California.  If the A-E design firm is comprised of a partnership, corporation, joint venture or other legal entity permitted by law to practice architecture or engineering, a complete description of the proposed internal responsibilities of the components must be included in the Stage I and II submittals.  This entity must be in place at the time of contract award.  Although this procurement is open to large businesses, small and minority A-E firms are encouraged to participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages the contributions of new and innovative designers to public architecture.  Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and disadvantaged firms as part of their original submitted teams.  Before award of the contract the A-E (if not a small business having an average gross receipts of less than $4M during each of the past three fiscal years) is required to submit an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  Offerors are invited to attend a pre-submittal conference to discuss project requirements and the selection process.

The Contractor shall be responsible for developing a training plan and shall assist in the plan?s implementation.

In addition, Ms. Sites currently resides in Kuwait, with the resultant benefit that the BBG will not incur additional travel expenses related to this procurement.

This Public Notice of intent to non-competitively contract with Ms. Sites is not a request for competitive price quotations or proposals.

Any information received from interested firms or individuals responding to this Notice will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct, or not to conduct, a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), has a potential requirement, subject to availability of funds, for a negotiated firm-fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to be awarded pursuant to full and open competition, for the contractor's on-call preventive and remedial maintenance and repair of hardware used within the BBG's existing "Lighthouse OZ Switching Systems" that are manufactured by the Lighthouse Digital Systems Company.  These switching systems are located at the BBG's Washington, DC Network Control Center (NCC); Greenville, NC transmitting station; and at the BBG's overseas transmitting stations located at Prague, Munich, Dubai, Philippines, and Kuwait.  The potential contract will also include the contractor's provision of on-call maintenance support of the operating and applications software that controls the digital switching systems, periodic upgrades and enhancements of this software, and training of transmitting station personnel on these existing switching systems.  The potential contract will include the contractor's providing hardware and software maintenance support to each switching system location pursuant to the Government's telephonic notification of needing such support on a twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week basis for a base-contract period of one (1) year, plus four (4) additional one-year optional renewal periods, for a total not-to-exceed contract term of up to five (5) consecutive years.  Furthermore, due to the critical need for these "Lighthouse OZ Switching Systems" to perform the BBG's global video and audio distribution mission at a minimal 99.97 % up-time reliability rate at all sites, the contractor's response time to initiate its delivery of tangibles (i.e., replacement and spare parts, preventive maintenance) and intangibles (i.e., remedial maintenance and repairs to correctly identify solutions to switching system operating problems and to quickly implement such solutions) must be within two (2) hours of the contractor's notification by the Government of a switching system operating problem as a result of a "trouble report" originating from either a transmitting station or the BBG's Network Control Center.  The contractor shall also develop a "Maintenance Plan" for each switching system site and shall establish and maintain a "Maintenance Log" for each switching system.  The contractor shall stock on-site the spares and repair parts for the switching systems that it deems necessary to ensure the minimal 99.97 % up-time system reliability rate, to the extent of such on-site spares and repair parts inventories being approved by the Government.

<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA).  This Federal Business Opportunities, (FedBizOpps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for proposed contract award to Northrop Grumman Airborne Ground Surveillance and Battle Management Systems.  ESC/SRK intends to award a contract to provide for the acquisition and fielding of Moving Target Indicator Exploitation (MTIX) systems and associated integration, testing and support services for the Air Force Distributed Common Ground Station (AF DCGS) at Ramstein Air Base, Germany (DGS-4).  Options for additional systems and associated support will also be included in the award.  This capability will provide operators at AF DCGS sites with a capability to visualize and exploit Moving Target Information (MTI) collected by key Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and sensors, to collaborate with other DCGS sites, and to view sensor products in near real time in support of time dominant decision-making.  The contractor will provide installation/integration and testing of MTIX systems/equipment; support security accreditation; provide training; and provide on site technical and maintenance support at DCGS sites. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2),"Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, full and open competition need not be provided for. (see 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)). Northrop Grumman has extensive experience and expertise in MTIX systems, which uniquely qualifies them for this effort. Northrop-Grumman developed and fielded the initial AF DCGS Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance manager (ISRM) which contained MTIX in the Remote Terminal Component (RTC).  The future architecture of AF DCGS is based on the ISRM architecture - a system which already has a developed interface for MTIX. During ISRM development and installation, Northrop Grumman acquired a significant amount of knowledge and technical expertise in intelligence data processing, exploitation and in DCGS and AOC application.  This knowledge and expertise is essential to a successful integration of a MTI exploitation capability into DCGS architecture.  Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of non-reoccurring engineering costs and significant delays and disruption of work.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An Acquisition Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection.  ESC's Acquisition Ombudsman is Mr. Jerry Corley, Director, Commander's Staff, ESC/CO, (781) 377-5106 or email at Jerry.Corley@hanscom.af.mil.  Call Kathleen N.  Cohen at (781) 377-5584 or email at kathleen.cohen@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, on behalf of the Office of Public Health and Science, Office of Women's Health (OWH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a 12 month simplified acquisition with WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease.  WomenHeart will develop a prototype for a gender-based medical and science website on early detection, accurate diagnoses, and proper treatment of women with various heart conditions.  The prototype will identify the most important signs and symptoms of heart disease in women, along with pertinent risk factors and treatment disparities; provide an educational section for the patient and healthcare provider with the most up-to-date research on detection, accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment of heart disease in women; provide up-to-date information on ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial access based on actively enrolling centers and sponsors; and, provide the infrastructure upon which to build additional modules for expanded content and presentation format.  The prototype will include content on coronary artery disease.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  WomenHeart is the only national organization with the expertise on women with heart disease necessary to write the content for the prototype.  The organization is devoted exclusively to heart disease in women and it provides support, information and advocacy to women, and their families, with diagnosed heart disease.  The organization highlights treatment disparities among women heart patients and works to ensure early detection, accurate diagnoses and proper treatment for women heart patients.  It has a Scientific Assembly Board comprised of leading women cardiologists, nurses and women's health advocates, as well as a national coalition of over 30 national membership organizations.  It is the only organization that represents women with coronary artery disease.  WomenHeart maintains close relationships with the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, giving it access to data on thousands of patients with heart disease.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing they can meet the Government's requirements within 45 days from the date of publication.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source to WomenHeart.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 541511 .  See Numbered Note 22.

A solicitation may be issued before funding is available, however, award of this project is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds.

<DESC>Furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, operations and all associated work required to perform Firm-Fixed Price Structural Repairs to Pier 4, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, WA in accordance with contract specifications, which include, but are not limited to: 
Epoxy injection of cracks, repair of spalls and delaminations, underwater concrete repair, structurally upgrading the load capacity on the approach section, polyurethane injection of construction joints between Bents 24 to 37, repair of an expansion joint, and replacement of the catwalks and ladders of Pier 4.  The repairs also include performing bond capacity tests on the repair and upgrade materials and other incidental related work.
The primary goal of this project is to extend the useful life of the pier.  This is achieved by filling existing cracks, repairing deteriorated concrete, and replacing corroded reinforcing steel.  Piling and cylinders will also be repaired with specialty underwater materials and methods.
The estimated duration of the project is 20 months.  It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to work around ongoing operations occurring both on the deck and alongside the pier, requiring a substantial coordination effort between the Contractor and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) during the project. The Contractor will be required to remove all equipment and materials that may interfere with PSNS operations upon a 48-hour notice.
The contract is broken into four phases to control the project quantities and schedule.   Phase A is all work to the 1933 approach section, including repairs, upgrades, and replacements above mean higher high water (MHHW).  Phase B is the 1914 pier section above MHHW, and Phase C is the 1923 pier section above MHHW.  Underwater (below MHHW) work is lumped into Phase D.  Phase D is an overlapping phase to occur sometime during the project.  This phase must remain flexible to comply with the work restrictions imposed by the Hydraulic Projects Approval (HPA) permit.

The NAICS Code is 234990 with a size standard of $17 Million. This solicitation is open to all business concerns. This acquisition will be competed under Source Selection procurement procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Branch proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109.  This proposed procurement will be a collaboration effort to study patient survival data using the SEER-Medicare database to evaluate the relationship between regular use of lower intestinal tract endoscopy frequency and survival for individual diagnosed with local and regional colorectal cancer.  The Applied Research Branch is involved in a colorectal cancer study where an estimated 130,200 new case and 56,300 deaths occurred in 2000.  Of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer cases, approximately 85% of patients will require surgery with curative intent and thus surveillance for recurrencies.  Results of randomized trials and meta-analyses do not suggest that there is a substantial benefit associated with intensive follow-up.  A recent study by Knopf and colleagues suggests there is substantial variation in acutal surveillance schedules following a diagnosis of colon cancer.  NCI will test the null hypothesis that regular care of endoscopy has no impact on survival for individuals diagnosed with localized colorectal cancer enrolled in Medicare.  A separate analyses shall be performed with all cause mortality and colorectal-cancer associated mortality as endpoints. Appropriate statistical methods shall be employed to analyze the database, including the use of survival analysis techniques that adjust for potential confounding factors that can exist in observational data.  This study will evaluate the impact of surveillance endoscopy of colorectal cancer survivors on (1) cancer-specific survival; (2) all cause survival, accounting for age, gender, treatment and comorbidity as potential confounding factors.  To achieve the goal of this study, investigators at the Fred Hutchinson shall work with the NCI staff in collaboration with the staff at Information Management Systems (IMS), Silver Spring, MD., to conduct the analysis.  The Fred Hutchinson will be responsible for directing the programming effort, preparation of tables and figures, and the final manuscript from the project.  
The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has extensive experience with the SEER-Medicare database, is in a unique position to provide data on the effects of endoscopy screening in those with limited stage colorectal cancer.  Their research team possesses the unique set of qualifications and experience for carrying out this analytical project, including the knowledge and experience in the statistical techniques required for analyzing survival data in observational data set and potentially confounding variables and selection bias, knowledge of the clinical issues involved and how to operationalize these issues using SEER-Medicare procedures and diagnosis codes, and experience in working with the NCI scientific staff on complex collaborative projects.  Based on the above information, The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is the only source known to the NCI investigators that can satisfy the Government?s requirement.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, it mas submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1PM EDT on or prior to August 1, 2002.   Any questions must be submitted in writing and can be emailed to dm170b@nih.gov or faxed to 301-402-4513.  It is the vendors responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to issue an order on a sole source basis to Dr. Hans Engler, Bethesda, MD 20817, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The Contractor shall provide the following services: (1) Develop improved methods for determining the frequency response of a linear, time-invariant electronic system from the system's step response data. (2) Identify suitable wavelet schemes for modeling step response, explore the potential and limitations of the schemes, and implement the approaches in software.  (3) Develop and formalize statistical approaches to determining uncertainty in the frequency domain resulting from non-uniform sampling in the time domain based on wavelet or ad-hoc models. (4) Determine to what extent the amplification of noise resulting from differentiating and Fourier transforming step response data can be avoided using model- based methods. (5) Identify wavelet schemes that are suitable for processing step response data, including data from non-uniform sampling. Describe their promise and outline any needed modifications. Implement them in Matlab and document the implementation. (6) Develop statistical error analysis for model-based approaches to step response measurements. The models should allow one to track measurement uncertainties, assess the size of non-model errors, predict the magnitude of noise amplification, and apply to non-uniform sampling schemes.  Write internal report.  (7) Develop criteria for ad-hoc models. Examine their numerical stability and develop models for error propagation from time domain to frequency domain. Write internal report.  Dr. Engler is the only source for this service because he has worked with NIST staff under University Grants from 1988 to 1999.  He has extensive experience in developing mathematical approaches to testing of complex electronic systems and the technical knowledge to help NIST start this new effort.  Dr. Engler has made long-standing technical contributions in statistical computing and numerical linear algebra.  He was also involved in the development of the NIST HELP toolbox from the beginning and is very familiar with its potential and limitations.  He also selected and co-wrote a portion of the HELP User's Guide, which became a NIST technical note and participated actively in some of the recent additions of the toolbox (handling missing data and the use of neural networks).  Due to his long-term affiliation with the Electronics & Electrical Engineering Laboratory as a guest scientist, he is familiar with issues of testing strategies for electronic devices.  The period of performance will be six months from the date of award.   The anticipated award date of the order is on or about 10 days from the date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  Interested persons may identify their intent and capability to respond to the requirement no later than the response date above.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For information, call the POC identified below.

<DESC>Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act, the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, of the National Marine Fisheries Service, is required to periodically assess the status of marine mammal populations in waters under U.S. jurisdiction.  Large-scale ship and aerial surveys have been conducted along the west coast, but information on cetaceans around the Hawaiian Islands remains sparse for most species.  In summer and fall of 2002, the SWFSC is planning a ship-based line-transect survey of cetaceans in the Hawaiian EEZ waters (from Hawaii to Midway and out 200 nmi).  However, that survey will be designed to cover a broad pelagic area and will not concentrate on insular stocks of cetaceans such as spinner dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, false killer whales, or spotted dolphins.  There is a need for additional studies to gather more information about these cetaceans which may be near to the Hawaiian Islands.  The information will be used in evaluating threats to populations, and will likely be used in policy decisions.  Therefore, the information in final report(s) must be of a quality equal to that found in scientific journals.  Collaboration with industry, both research organizations and commercial vessel owners, is desired. 

The Western Administrative Support Center seeks proposals in the following areas: estimating abundance of species; determining movement and residency patterns; determining local habitat usage and depth distributions; obtaining tissue samples for genetic analysis of population structure; obtaining identification photographs of uniquely marked individuals.  Up to $130,000 is available for one or more selected proposals.  The period of performance will be from award, expected in late September, through August 2003.  Firm fixed price contract(s) are anticipated.  Charter of a vessel will be required.  No Government equipment or property will be provided.

Proposals should be submitted to: NOAA, Western Administrative Support Center, Acquisition Management Division, 7600 Sand Point Way N.E., Seattle, WA. 98155, Attn: D.E. Caldwell.  Proposals should be in hard copy, with an original and three copies.  Offerors should submit a cover sheet with their proposals, indicating name, address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail address for technical and business points of contact.  The due date for proposals is 29 August 2002, not later than 2:00 p.m., PST.  Proposals should consist of two sections:  technical and price.  Both should reference the BAA number, and state the offeror's project title.  Offeror format is acceptable but technical proposals should include:  resumes or discussion of qualifications for key personnel; a description of the technical approach, including vessel charter plans and how the approach  represents Government/industry collaboration; a brief description of scientific methodology, including a justification of methodology based on peer-reviewed science; a discussion of the benefits of the proposed research; and a statement of work, including specific tasks, reports, and schedule.  The statement of work, with possible changes, will be incorporated into the resulting contracts for the selected firm(s).  Technical proposals should not exceed fifteen pages, including the statement of work.  Price proposals should include a Representations and Certifications package, available from the individual named above, and a breakdown of direct labor, labor overhead, subcontracts, materials, travel, any other direct costs, G&A, and profit.  

The evaluation criteria are as follows: benefits of the proposed research; technical approach and scientific methodologies; qualifications of proposed personnel; quality of the statement of work; intention to utilize a commercial fishing vessel which has had activities curtailed by Government regulations; and reasonableness of proposed price and relationship to perceived benefits.  The evaluation of technical proposals will be conducted by one or more technical experts in the appropriate disciplines.   

This notice constitutes a BAA as described in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  No additional written material will be provided, except the aforementioned Reps and Certs.  No hard copy version of this announcement will be provided.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted.  With selected proposals, the Government may invite any offeror to enter into negotiations on price issues.  This announcement is set aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 541710, which specifies a small business size standard of 500 employees or fewer. Questions should be directed to Mr. Caldwell.

<DESC>DESC: The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention, (DCP) Chemoprevention Agent Development Research Group (CADRG) is interested in evaluating inhibitors or potential inhibitors of any stage of carcinogenesis, in order to identify potential chemopreventive agents.  Such agents are to be further evaluated in appropriate toxicological and/or clinical settings. The CADRG has established a clearly defined integrated plan for the evaluation of chemopreventive agents.  This plan delineates detailed criteria for classifying the quantity and quality of information that currently exists on any chemopreventive agent and thus defines what additional information and investigations are required to qualify the agent's experimental use in intervention trials of human cancer.  The primary purpose of this RFP is to further evaluate chemopreventive agents for which there exists at least one published report regarding their effectiveness in inhibiting carcinogenesis.  The object of these studies is to establish the general efficacy of the chemopreventive agent in animal model systems representing selected target organs, different species, and different carcinogens. This RFP involves five Workstatements (Nos. 98-102).  Certain study design characteristics apply to the specific Workstatements under this RFP. Most of the requirements for the Workstatement study design will be detailed in the specific workstatement. Each workstatement will have a specific period of performance. The workstatements are: WS 98 - Efficacy studies of selected chemopreventive agents administered by aerosol in the Syrian Golden hamster lung model; WS 99 - Efficacy testing in the p27kip1 knockout mouse prostate tumor model with selected chemopreventive agents;  WS 100 - Chemopreventive studies in an IGF1 mediated of mouse prostate cancer; WS 101 - Efficacy of Chemopreventive agents in a hgf mediate induced model of melanoma; WS 102 - Effacy of topically applied chemopreventive agents and diet in SKH-1 mice: a chemoprevention model for basal cell carcinoma.

It is anticipated that this RFP will be available electronically about August 1, 2002 to all current MA Holders.  In order to be considered for award, all offerors shall be Holders of an Efficacy Studies of Chemopreventive Agents in Animal Models Master Agreement and members of this pool as of the release date of this RFP.

<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with
Watershed Initiatives (WI)) for the National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS).  Purpose of proposed contract is to develop a recovery planning
coordination and outreach strategy for the north central California
coast Recovery Planning domain.  Watershed Initiatives has worked in the
past with NMFS NW Region to establish an effective outreach program in
the Lower columbia/Willamette River recovery planning area.  As part of
that contract, Watershed Initiatives provided initial planning support
to NMFS SW Region for a similar outreach effort.  This work has resulted
in preliminary drafts of educational materials for use in California to
promote understanding and awareness of NMFS' recovery planning process,
to explain the conservation tools available under the Endangered Species
Act (ESA), and to initiate the dialog with co-managers and partners to
begin developing a recovery plan for salmon and steelhead in the North
Central California Coastal recovery planning domain.  Proposed contract
will capitalize on work already performed by WI  and take advantage of
experience gained.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated
value of less than $100,000.  Questions concerning proposed acquisition
may be directed to Randall Brown at (206) 526-6226 or fax (206)
526-6025.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Xiaoling Chen, 4808 Wellington Drive, Apt. 109, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815, to collect data and modify the customized designed database for the Characterization of the Pathogenesis of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) protocol (#96-H-0186) and the LAM Registry protocol (#99-H-0020).  Through non competitive procedure Dr. Xiaoling Chen was issued a purchase order to design a database for the LAM disease.  Dr. Chen designed the LAM Data base and possesses extensive knowledge and expertise in this area, he has designed data collection databases and he is familiar with research initiatives of this type relating to protocols.  An award to any other source would result in a considerable duplication of cost to the Government and those costs cannot be recovered through competition.  BACKGROUND: The NHLBI Pulmonary-Critical Care Medicine Branch maintains a data base of over 200 patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.  The PCCMB admits patients with LAM to the Characterization of the Pathogenesis of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis protocol (#96-H-0186) every six months and to the LAM Registry protocol (#99-H-0020) on a yearly basis.  The duration of these protocols is for five years.  At each yearly visit, the patient is asked to complete several data forms as required by the Registry protocol.  This data includes medical and surgical history, medications, pulmonary function studies, quality of life questionnaires (2), radiographic information and tissue specimen information.  The Contractor shall be responsible for transcribing data onto standard data collection forms; checking the forms for completeness and accuracy and forwarding them to the LAM Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at the Cleveland Clinic in a timely manner; answer data queries as generated by the DCC, checking inconsistencies/errors, making any corrections on the data forms and returning them to the DCC; complete other forms as necessary, such as telephone contracts, transplant notifications, post transplant data, and death forms.  Input all the information collected during the six-month visit into the LAM database.  The medical information is collected by physician, nurses, and other disciplines involved in patient care.  The data in the medical records, may contain LAM patient identifying information, patient profile, medical history management, and clinical research.  This information is transcribed by the contractor into a computerized database.  The Database Design is the customized database designed by the contractor for the LAM disease, which includes tables, relationships, queries and melding of the existing PCCMB patient database.  The objective of this requirement is to maintain, modify and update the LAM Database based on relevant clinical information.  The period of performance is twelve (12) months from the date of the award of the contract.  The Contractor shall submit weekly reports outlining the progress to date.  Also, Interim reports requested by the Branch Chief shall be submitted.  This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541690, Size Standard $6.0 million is applicable to this requirement.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.  Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PS-2002-99 may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Building RKL2, Suite 6042, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention Ms. Cecilia Morales, Purchasing Agent.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for upgraded Software development tools for use in piloted aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) simulation studies.  The software tools, capable of importing digital terrain elevation and feature analysis data (from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency) to create a 3D database, are to be used in the Flight Simulation Facilities at NASA Ames Research Center. Some of the same 3D databases will eventually be used in the cockpit during actual flight. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase Vega Prime, Annual Support for Vega Prime, Vega Prime Runtime Environment, upgrade MultiGen Creator to Creator Pro with Terrain Pro, and Annual Support for MultiGen Creator Terrain Bundle for Windows, from MultiGen-Paradigm Inc., 19100 Von Karman, Ste 900, Irvine, CA 92612, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) based on the fact that the helicopter-simulation software tools of MultiGen-Paradigm Inc. are able to process tremendous amount of digital elevation terrain data and produce the high-quality clear graphic displays for pilots (or UAV operators) to use during simulations and actual flight.    In addition, MultiGen-Paradigm Creator is currently being used to establish a "first-generation" capability at ARC for synthetic vision simulation in the RIPTIDE simulator.  In order to continue with this development and to advance our synthetic vision simulation capabilities, NASA Ames intends to procure from MultiGen-Paradigm the software upgrades mentioned above.  The software shall be able to import geometrically corrected satellite images, digital terrain elevation data (DTED), and digital feature analysis data (DFAD) from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency archives with the additional ability to create new objects in the database.  Two flight displays shall be developed using the software:  1) The primary flight display which will be a perspective 3D view of the terrain from the eye-point of a simulated, moving aircraft that includes a grid-world (no texture), random textured, and a photo-textured representation of the terrain.  2) The secondary flight display which will be a scrolling, rotating image of the terrain (using satellite photos) in such a way that the eye-point is always at a specified location on the screen and the vertical direction of the photo is aligned with the simulated aircraft heading -  a photo-moving map.  On both the primary and secondary flight display, the OpenGL graphics symbology and text data shall overlay the terrain image or photo image, in order to provide the pilot with aircraft state information.  Compatibility with the existing Openflight file format is required. It is critical that the software tools purchased have the following specific characteristics:  1) the symbology graphics software shall be user programmable in OpenGL;  2) the aircraft state information shall be received using TCP/IP sockets on an Ethernet network; 3) the software shall run on IBM PC compatible computers  running either a Linux or Windows NT, 2000 or XP operating system; 4) the output shall be IBM PC compatible video, from 640x480 to 1280x1024 resolution; 5) the update rate  of the generated graphical display  shall be 25Hz, minimum.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on July 31, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD announces its intent to contract for a Noise Reduction System for the C-9B (DC-9-32F) Aircraft.  This effort will require a Federal Aviation Administration Supplemental Type Certificate for Navy C-9B Aircraft that meets or exceeds the Stage III Noise Levels as specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations, Chapter 1, Part36.5(a)3, appendix C.  This is a non-developmental effort; the Government is seeking a Noise Reduction System with proven performance in the commercial fleet.  In addition, the modification must meet the following requirements:

1.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Takeoff Weight of 110,000 pounds must be maintained.
2.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Landing Weight of 102,000 pounds with 40 degree Approach Flaps must be maintained.
3.	The rated engine thrust of a Stage II Configured Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines, as currently used on the C-9B Aircraft, must not be adversely affected.
4.	Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption of the currently installed Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines must not be adversely affected.
5.	Reliability and maintainability of Navy C-9B Aircraft and JT8D-9A Engines, as currently configured, must not be adversely affected.
6.	Any increase in Aircraft Empty Weight must not exceed 350 pounds.
7.	The system must be supportable by 2-level maintenance concept, O to D.
8.	The system should require no new or critical logistics support resource requirements.
9.	Must not require any additional transportability requirements.

The Government intends to award either one or two firm fixed price contracts for two of the major tasks required to complete this modification: 1. Acquisition of the STC Data and airframe parts required; and, 2.  Installation/integration of the airframe parts and JT8D-9A Engines, following modification o fthose engines to a Stage III configuration.  All work is to be accomplished in accordance with the FAA STC, the Navy Approved Aircraft Maintenance Manual, and the Pratt & Whitney Approved Maintenance Manual for the JT8D-9A Engine.  Prospective offerors may submit proposals for one, or both, of these tasks.  The offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government will be awarded a contract for that task.  If one offeror provides the best value for performing both tasks, one contract will be awarded to that offeror.    

This procurement will be conducted using the principles outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The Navy intends to release the Request for Proposals, including any subsequent amendments, only over the Internet.

Documentation supporting the tentative decision is avail able for review at Building 111, Room 217, Fort Hamilton, New York. Due to heightened security measures interested parties should contact Mr. Bruce Gorski at (718)630-4235 or Mr. Andrew Rupert at (718)630-4494 to schedule review. Appeals of the decision sh ould be mailed or delivered to Mr. William E. Campbell, Jr., Contracting Officer, 9410 Jackson Loop, Suite 101, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5134. This tentative decision was originally announced in FEDBIZOPPS on 1 May 2002 via Special Notice USA-SNOTE-020501-00 4.

<DESC>Furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, operations and all associated work required to perform Firm-Fixed Price Structural Repairs to Pier 4, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, WA in accordance with contract specifications, which include, but are not limited to: 
Epoxy injection of cracks, repair of spalls and delaminations, underwater concrete repair, structurally upgrading the load capacity on the approach section, polyurethane injection of construction joints between Bents 24 to 37, repair of an expansion joint, and replacement of the catwalks and ladders of Pier 4.  The repairs also include performing bond capacity tests on the repair and upgrade materials and other incidental related work.
The primary goal of this project is to extend the useful life of the pier.  This is achieved by filling existing cracks, repairing deteriorated concrete, and replacing corroded reinforcing steel.  Piling and cylinders will also be repaired with specialty underwater materials and methods.
The estimated duration of the project is 20 months.  It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to work around ongoing operations occurring both on the deck and alongside the pier, requiring a substantial coordination effort between the Contractor and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) during the project. The Contractor will be required to remove all equipment and materials that may interfere with PSNS operations upon a 48-hour notice.
The contract is broken into four phases to control the project quantities and schedule.   Phase A is all work to the 1933 approach section, including repairs, upgrades, and replacements above mean higher high water (MHHW).  Phase B is the 1914 pier section above MHHW, and Phase C is the 1923 pier section above MHHW.  Underwater (below MHHW) work is lumped into Phase D.  Phase D is an overlapping phase to occur sometime during the project.  This phase must remain flexible to comply with the work restrictions imposed by the Hydraulic Projects Approval (HPA) permit.

The NAICS Code is 234990 with a size standard of $17 Million. This solicitation is open to all business concerns. This acquisition will be competed under Source Selection procurement procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government price and technical factors considered.

<DESC>This is a modification to the initial synopsis for Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Broad Agency Announcement 2001-2 (BAA 2001-2).  For reference purposes, this modification may be considered and referred to as BAA 2001-2, Amendment A002. On June 15, 2001, the FRA posted a notice (i.e., synopsis) to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at  http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ (the same site is also accessible/co-located at http://www.eps.gov) for the conduct of BAA 2001-2 titled, Funds Availability for Research Projects and Technology Advancements under the Next Generation High-Speed Rail Program.  The BAA serves as a means by which the FRA may solicit proposal concept papers for various research projects, technology advancements and/or demonstrations directed at enhancing the deployment of high-speed rail service in the United States.  On July 2, 2001 the BAA 2001-2 Proposal Preparation Package (BAA 2001-2 Package) (i.e., the solicitation (the specific medium, content and format requirements and additional instructions for preparing submissions, as well as further information on the areas of interest themselves and the evaluation/selection process)) was posted at FedBizOpps.  BAA 2001-2 was initially advertised as being open from the date of posting of the BAA 2001-2 Package on FedBizOpps . . . through June 30, 2002.  The Time Line for BAA 2001-2 (as of June 28, 2002, through the issuance of Amendment A001) was revised to read as follows: Prospective offerors may submit and the FRA will accept proposal concept papers as of July 2, 2001.  Unless BAA 2001-2 is superceded or canceled, FRA will continue to accept concept submissions and inquiries through December 31, 2002.  Although the BAA is open for an extended period, interested parties would be well advised to submit proposals as early as possible.  Submissions that are incomplete or materially lacking, pursuant to the instructions in the BAA 2001-2 Package, may be returned unevaluated, or evaluated as is, without further opportunity for revision, at the discretion of the Source Selection Authority. Amendment A001 officially extended the closing date of BAA 2001-2 to December 31, 2002.  Amendment A002 (a) confirms that extension through December 31, 2002, and (b) is issued to meet a technical systems requirement of FedBizOpps that is necessary to ensure the documentation and materials related to BAA 2001-2 remain accessible for viewing, printing or downloading by interested parties through the date of extension.  All other portions of BAA 2001-2, to include the initial synopsis,  the BAA 2001-2 Package, and Amendment A001 (excepting the appearance in any of these documents of a BAA 2001-2 closing date other than December 31, 2002, as amended), shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.  For information concerning BAA 2001-2, all parties should contact the grants/contracting or technical officials listed in the initial synopsis and BAA 2001-2 Package.

Q3 - How many total workstations will the design be for?
Q3 - There are two large work stations and two admin areas, one of which is also a small work station.  Other areas are for equipment and storage.
Q4 - Are these units to be place outdoor or indoor location? 
A4 ? Indoor
Q5 - In reviewing the Description of the Solicitation and the drawings, we could not confirm the electrical requirements.  Do all panels have power raceways?

Could you provide dimensions both in overall plan, i.e. length and width of each modular unit and overall size as well as height is needed - both floor to ceiling and overall height limits. Can you provide detail plans? On your bid site, I only saw two 'images' in plan view and no elevation view.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD announces its intent to contract for a Noise Reduction System for the C-9B (DC-9-32F) Aircraft.  This effort will require a Federal Aviation Administration Supplemental Type Certificate for Navy C-9B Aircraft that meets or exceeds the Stage III Noise Levels as specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations, Chapter 1, Part36.5(a)3, appendix C.  This is a non-developmental effort; the Government is seeking a Noise Reduction System with proven performance in the commercial fleet.  In addition, the modification must meet the following requirements:

1.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Takeoff Weight of 110,000 pounds must be maintained.
2.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Landing Weight of 102,000 pounds with 40 degree Approach Flaps must be maintained.
3.	The rated engine thrust of a Stage II Configured Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines, as currently used on the C-9B Aircraft, must not be adversely affected.
4.	Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption of the currently installed Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines must not be adversely affected.
5.	Reliability and maintainability of Navy C-9B Aircraft and JT8D-9A Engines, as currently configured, must not be adversely affected.
6.	Any increase in Aircraft Empty Weight must not exceed 350 pounds.
7.	The system must be supportable by 2-level maintenance concept, O to D.
8.	The system should require no new or critical logistics support resource requirements.
9.	Must not require any additional transportability requirements.
10.     System should have no adverse impact on aircraft range, as currently configured.

The Government will require pre and post-Hushkit engine and aircraft performance data regarding, but not limited to, such factors as; Thrust, Fuel Flow (TSFC, Total Fuel Burn) and Acceleration (Spool-Up) Time.  The Goverment also desires an on-site review of all technical data presented by the Contractor to the FAA, as the basis for granting of the Stage III Hushkit STC.

The Government intends to award either one or two firm fixed price contracts for two of the major tasks required to complete this modification: 1. Acquisition of the STC Data and airframe parts required; and, 2.  Installation/integration of the airframe parts and JT8D-9A Engines, following modification o fthose engines to a Stage III configuration.  All work is to be accomplished in accordance with the FAA STC, the Navy Approved Aircraft Maintenance Manual, and the Pratt & Whitney Approved Maintenance Manual for the JT8D-9A Engine.  Prospective offerors may submit proposals for one, or both, of these tasks.  The offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government will be awarded a contract for that task.  If one offeror provides the best value for performing both tasks, one contract will be awarded to that offeror.    

This procurement will be conducted using the principles outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The Navy intends to release the Request for Proposals, including any subsequent amendments, only over the Internet.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought.  The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center is seeking qualified sources for the inspection and repair of Ingersoll-Rand Pneumatic Winches, NSN 3950-00-368-5253 and 3950-01-384-4758, which are used onboard various WLI, WLIC and WLR Class Coast Guard vessels.  Contractor will be required to provide all labor and materials required to perform the following on each winch:  (1) receive; (2) disassemble; (3) inspect; (4) provide a detailed inspection report/repair estimate; (5) repair; (6) reassemble; (7) test; and (8) preserve and install in a reusable container.  All repairs shall be made in accordance with current Ingersoll-Rand specifications and standards and Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center Specification Number 025-R-583-222.  All parts to be furnished and used with the repair must be genuine Ingersoll-Rand parts.  It is believed that only Ingersoll-Rand and/or its authorized repair facilities can (1) obtain the necessary specifications and genuine OEM parts to accomplish repairs; and (2) can furnish the required items and ensure the proper fit, form, and function of all its components.  Therefore, it is the Coast Guard?s intent to handle this procurement as a sole source with Ingersoll-Rand or its authorized repair facilities.  Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Ingersoll-Rand are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Ingersoll-Rand.  Accordingly, it is believed that this no availability of technical data precludes the Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center from obtaining competition, as the proprietary data is only available from only one source.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning its capability to overhaul the winches for the purpose of the Coast Guard to determined whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the parts and perform the repair/overhaul are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities by submitting the following information:  (1)  Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufactured for the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer, which includes complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e. salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics); and (2) Data that the required repair/overhaul has been previously and successfully provided to the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  This information shall be submitted within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required at this time.  This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirements mentioned above.  Adequate detailed data shall be sent to the attention of Sharon Jackson.  ATTENTION:  Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs)!  The Department of Transportation (DOT) Short-Term Lending Program (STLP) offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation related contracts.  Maximum line of credit is $500,000 with interest at the prime rate.  For further information call (800) 532-1169.  Internet address:  http://osdbuweb.dot.gov.  See number notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) 	is seeking qualification statements from sources capable of delivering Hot box detectors.  Unless another qualified source is available it is anticipated that a sole source firm fixed price award will be made to GE Transportation System - Global Signaling. The required delivery date is September 2002.
As a part of the IDOT PTC (Illinois Department of Transportation Positive Train Control) project, FRA plans to acquire a high speed hot box detector to interface with a new train control system to be equipped in the Chicago, IL and St. Louis, MO rail corridor.  The hot box detector mounted on the base of the rail will detect overheated bearings in locomotives and freight cars when a train rolls by at a speed up to 150 mph.  This detector also has the ability to detect any dragging appurtenances detached from their connections to the freight cars.  The detector will automatically alert the train crew if any overheated bearing or dragging equipment is detected, so that the train will be stopped and the defective condition can be corrected before any hazard can be developed.  Necessary hardware and software will be an integral part of the detector system so that this new generation of detectors can communicate with the central office and the locomotives through the train control system using a pre-defined and existing message protocol as a basis of communication to a unit installed on the wayside of the track and the central office through a wireless communication network. The system needs to be a turnkey system, i.e. all the parts, except conduits, telephone lines and power cables, are to be supplied by the vendor.  Additional accessories to enable the device to perform more reliably, e.g. scanner heaters and train presence detection mechanism are to be provided by the vendor.  Non-volatile computer memory is required to store the data on 100,000 axles.  The data will include, but may not be limited to, train speed, direction, axle count of the train, defects found, axle number and side of the train with the defects.  Defects with dragging equipment will be logged also.  The results of the detection are expected to be broadcast and the data be sent instantaneously to the wayside unit described above as soon as the rear end of the train passes the scanner of the detector.  Any post processing after the rear end passes the detector will take less than 10 seconds.  The detector is expected to be highly reliable and will not initiate false alarms unnecessarily.  Software algorithm is to be employed to increase the reliability of detection by comparing the bearing temperature as compared to others of the train for any abnormal condition.  Necessary calibration and alignment equipment should be included in the proposal.  Engineering and other technical support is expected from the supplier throughout the installation process up to a successful completion with a fully functional unit.  Interested sources must submit a fully descriptive statement of qualification by 2:00 p.m., on Thursday May 23, 2002.  Qualification statements shall be limited to 15 pages, including a description of organizational and individual knowledge as well as working experience with the aforementioned tasks.   Sufficient detail should be provided in the qualification statement to allow the agency to make a determination of whether the work can be performed by your company.   In addition to qualification statements, please submit Resumes of key personnel who would be assigned to manage and implement the required work.  Resumes shall be limited to 2 pages or less and will not be included in the 15 page limit.  Qualification statements may be submitted to the above address, fax number 202-493-6171 or e-mail to Sharon.Flowers@fra.dot.gov.

<DESC>1.0 INTRODUCTION:

The United States Customs Service currently operates sixteen P3 Orion variants to perform interceptor, tracker and maritime surveillance missions.  These aircraft are over thirty years old, and six have in excess of 20,000 flight hours.  Customs wishes to explore the feasibility of performing an engineering investigation into the continued airworthiness of these airframes.  All aircraft have been extensively modified to perform a variety of missions.  These alterations include the addition of structural components and airframe modifications. 

2.0 REQUEST:

Customs is seeking industry interest and information on commercially available engineering analysis of the P3 flight profile and airframe airworthiness.  The derived data should enable an independent determination of airframe service life remaining, current mission profile impact, and future heavy maintenance requirements.  Data will be evaluated to assess the risk associated with continued aircraft utilization at an untenably high Fatigue Life Index (FLI) and/or whether the resultant operational and support costs are excessive due to increased inspection and repair costs.

3.0 REQUIREMENTS:

Determine the current Fatigue Life Index (FLI) of each aircraft.
Project the future FLI based on projected usage of each aircraft.
Project future inspection and heavy maintenance requirements.
Project Service Life of individual aircraft.
Determine the greatest risk factors which will limit continued service.
Determine whether the aircraft are suitable to be operated under their original design specification. 

4.0 RESPONSES

<DESC>NA Recent operational experience has demonstrated that Army watercraft do not possess the capabilities to seamlessly integrate its logistical requirements.  This capability shortfall puts the burden on the vessel crew to manually log their inventory, requisit ion supplies, track completed maintenance actions, and record projected logistics requirements.  This paperwork detracts from the available maintenance crew time and contributes to overall performance delays.  Army watercraft must possess the capability to  automatically monitor and manage all mission critical on-board systems.  To that end the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command is seeking sources to identify a monitoring, management and audible alarm notification system for our developing Telel ogistics Program.  This Program requires an open architecture system that can provide integrated watercraft systems management, support of logistical functions such as inventory management and supply requisitions, tracking and prioritization of maintenance , machinery history, vessel modifications, and fuel management.  It will need to include interface capability with Interactive Electronic Manuals (IETMs) to support interactive equipment troubleshooting, monitoring of on-board systems with an audible notif ication to enable condition based maintenance, prognostic/diagnostic capabilities, and enhance vessel situational awareness.  These technologies are to be integrated into a single on-board maintenance management system providing automation interface with t he Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS), and The Army Maintenance Management Systems (TAMMS) as pertains to Army watercraft, as a minimum.  Additionally, the system must show a balance of focus on both the current and future watercraft req uirements.  It must consider complete vessel systems integration to include voyage management, administrative/personnel functions and on-board communications systems.  All information systems (engineering, navigation, personnel, etc.) on-board Army watercr aft will need to be fully integrated utilizing a Ship Wide Area Network (SWAN).  This is required to enable seamless oversight, information sharing, information warehousing, and allow watercraft crews to effectively and efficiently monitor, maintain, troub leshoot, and sustain the Armys watercraft fleet of LSV's (7 ea.), LCU's (35 ea.) and Large Tugs (6 ea.) in all environments, including joint operations. The following information is also requested: (1) Has your company done work with the Government before? If so, provide a listing of those programs with an explanation of what you provided.  If you have provided a similar product to the commercial industry an explanation of what was provided and to wh om it was provided is desired. Were you the prime contractor? The subcontractor? (2) Have you provided any telecommunications system to commercial or Government agencies for Watercraft? (3) Identify the Company name, point of contact, address, telephone, and e-mail address (if available).   (4) Are you a small business, large business, and/or do you have set-aside status of any kind?   (5) Are you registered in the CCR? The response to this request may be submitted in any form or format, including the company's standard literature. Price data is desirable. Proprietary information submitted will be protected when so designated. The sources sought announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by TACOM to issue a formal solicitation, nor award a contract, nor is it a Request for Proposal. TACOM is not responsible for reimbursement of any costs connected with providing any information requested herein.  Potential/interested sources should send the requested information to the following: Commander, U.S. Army TACOM, ATTN: AMSTA-LC-CJEB, Mail Stop 231 (Toni Spalding, Contract Specialist), 6501 East 11 Mile Road, Warren, MI 48397-5000, or through e-mail to th e Contract Specialist, within 30-days of the date of publication of this notice.

<SUBJECT>A -- Gamma Watermarking Products
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY LICENSEE TO PRODUCE AND SELL GAMMA WATERMARKING PRODUCTS


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to produce Gamma Watermarking products.

A Livermore research team has developed a new property-tagging and identification technology that uses a combination of tiny quantities of radioisotopes and advanced commercially-supported gamma-ray spectroscopy. This new technology, known as Gamma Watermarking, produces "gamma watermarks" that can establish robust links between owners and their property.

This technology uses miniscule combinations of radioisotopes to provide a unique identification and time stamp on objects.   These "watermarks"  emit a billionth of a curie (this is no stronger than background radiation which exists around us).   The watermark can consist of a small dot of material (less than 1 microgram or less than 0.01 cm  in diameter), or the tag can be mixed directly into liquids such as ink. (The format of the "watermark" may be tailored to the specific application, enhancing the tag's covert nature.)  This new property-marking technology protects any item of greater than microscopic size. 

This effectively-invisible watermark can be sensed and read for decades thereafter with an appropriate detector. In addition to the object-identifying digital signature, the watermark-tag contains a built-in "clock" that provides a date-stamp corresponding to its creation.  Gamma Watermarking thus produces a unique digital signature comprised of combinations of radioactive isotopes that emit extremely low levels of gamma radiation, which enhances its covert nature and prevents counterfeiting.

Enhanced security for especially valuable objects may be attained by placing one or more watermarks within the object in an ad hoc manner to make it/them virtually invisible, even under detailed examination. 

Commercial gamma-ray detectors can detect the tag if the users know what they are looking for.  One of the advantages of this system lies in the non-obvious nature of the tag.  Because the tag uses extremely low levels of gamma-ray emissions, it blends into the background radiation.  This makes the tag difficult to detect unless a searcher knows what and where to search for it. To provide further security, it is also possible for the tag to operate properly if buried inside of an object.  Given the location and the signature, the watermark is readily detectable and may be made readable from buried locations up to a few centimeters in depth.


Despite being non-obvious, the tag provides ironclad proof of an object's identity and age, and this technology offers an excellent means for covertly marking objects. Companies working in cooperation with federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies may find the Gamma Watermark a useful tool-set for uniquely and inexpensively establishing object identification/authentication, over intervals as long as several decades.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's GAMMA WATERMARKING should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

<SUBJECT>A -- Direct Carbon Conversion Fuel Cells
<DESC>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Seeking Partnerships with Industry to Develop and Commercialize Direct Carbon Conversion Fuel Cells Technology

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking industrial partners to further develop and commercialize Direct Carbon Conversion Fuel Cell Technology

The earth's atmosphere faces a detrimental accumulation of greenhouse gases-especially CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels. This has led to considerations of increasing the efficiency of energy production from fossil fuels and managing the release of the product CO2 to the atmosphere through integrated production and sequestration technologies.

LLNL scientists have developed a novel configuration for a carbon/air fuel cell that consumes particles of carbon and oxygen (e.g., from the air) in a molten salt electrolyte and produces electric power at practical rates at an efficiency of 80% based on the heat of combustion of carbon.  LLNL has intellectual property in such areas as cell configurations and refueling, control of melt saturation of fuels and components, rejection of impurities, and preparation of fuels.

Government uses for this technology include efficient electric power generation in broad mobile, transportable and stationary applications. 

Potential commercial applications include electric power generation at high efficiencies from coal-derived carbon, petroleum-derived fuels, petroleum coke, biomass charcoal and natural gas. 

LLNL has filed patents on various embodiments of these inventions.  LLNL is seeking industrial partners to license and commercialize LLNL's direct carbon conversion fuel cell technology. LLNL is also interested in collaborative research and development partnership to improve and to explore other usages of the inventions. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's direct carbon conversion fuel cell technology should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) and will follow simplified acquisition procedures.  Responses are requested pursuant to this announcement.  All responses shall reference Solicitation 163P02200849.   This solicitation incorporates all of the applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 01-08, as if stated in full text, as well as the terms and conditions of FAR 52-212-1.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) anticipates awarding multiple purchase orders as a result of this solicitation.  This procurement is set aside for small business.  The North American Industrial Classification Code System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 422920.  For this NAICS a small business is not to exceed 100 employees.



Background:  The USPTO Scientific and Technical Information Center (STIC) provides research tools to the patent examining corps.  The patent examining corps uses non-patent literature to keep abreast of trends and advances in areas related to patent examination and to help determine the patentability of inventions.  A part of that research requires the review of current and historical literature in varied fields of patent invention and current and historical trends through standard references, handbooks, textbooks, and general desk references.  Not all of these materials are available in electronic format.  STIC procures hard copy titles through the FEDLINK Basic Ordering Agreement.  FEDLINK delivery times and availability vary.  

STIC has committed to book delivery to patent examiners within 10-14 business days of the receipt of the request.  This complies with the core of the USPTO Strategic Plan to improve patent pendency and the efficiency of the agency.  The requested service will contribute to the Strategic Plan and help patent examiners meet targeted congressional and agency goals.  It is imperative that delivery of books be timely.  STIC will continue to use FEDLINK as the primary and preferred source for all requests.  STIC will determine when FEDLINK is not able to meet the requirement.


Objective:  The USPTO STIC plans to acquire ordering services that will provide rush delivery of all in-print literature, and prompt delivery of rare, foreign, and out-of-print titles that are not otherwise available through FEDLINK.  This procurement is set aside for small business.  The intended procurement method is un-priced purchase orders as described in FAR 13-302-2.  These purchase orders will be awarded on a not-to-exceed basis with a maximum performance period of one base year and four option years.  Subject to adjustment, the realistic monetary limitation per book/item is $130.00.  Price will be established at the time of issuance of each individual request to the vendors.
