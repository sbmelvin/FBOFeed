All potential offerors are reminded that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (CCR), lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.

<DESC><strong>Description<br /></strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Center Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans to procure on a sole source basis the two (2) Radium-224 Radioisotope Generators with purification process for the removal of stable lead (Pb) from AlphaMed, Inc. P.O. Box 361, Sheldonville, MA 02070.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />Delivery Date: 120 days from date of award. <br /><br />The Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) focuses on the biologic and therapeutic effect of radiation therapy. The research clinical trials that the ROB develops and conducts involve novel technology and imaging based approaches to radiation therapy treatment. Currently, Ra-224 generators are required for on-site production of the daughter radionuclide from the decay process, Pb-212, that the NCI has been using to perform extensive pre-clinical studies on disseminated colorectal disease animal model system. These experiments have defined not only max. tolerated dose (MTD) in this model but also produced significant extension of survival, and defined the impact of combination therapy with gemcitabine. Most recently the NCI has demonstrated not only the beneficial effects of combination therapy with paclitaxel, but also that administration order is a critical variable that had to be arrived at empirically. This same variable was radionuclide dependent as opposed to being a direct biological factor. To this end, the NCI has now actively translated the results into a Phase 1 clinical trial in collaboration with the University of Alabama, Birmingham with our CRADA partner, AREVAMed with an IND approved by the FDA in Feb. 2011. From that same IND approval, the NCI now possesses requirements for further studies as well as periodic stability measurements required by the FDA as well as transchelation studies and protein stability studies requisite to maintain and continue that same Phase 1 trial. To execute those studies there is a significant need of generators to validate both the cGMP production antibody conjugate as well as to continue to validate both facilities and SOPs.<br /><br />AlphaMed has the exclusive contract from the Department of Energy (DOE) for marketing this radionuclide due to the parental being fissionable and not available from any commercial source in this country. AlphaMed was awarded this contract by the DOE in June of 2002 to privatize production of Bi-212 which is one of the daughters eluted from the Ra-224 generators. There are no other known sources which sell ready to use generators at greater than 2-5 mCi of Ra-224. The most critical characteristics and requirements of these generators is that they are consistent with those previously prepared for and used by the ROB for their animal model pre-clinical therapy studies. Activity levels of 15-20 mCi is a minimal amount of Ra-224 that has to be on the generators such that adequate amounts of Pb-212 can be provided. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received at the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on May 23, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-110062-TG on all correspondences.

<SUBJECT>Assessing Psychopathology in Children with Early-Life Temperament Types

<CONTACT>Korriise L. LaRoche, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-8782, Email larochek@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to the University of Maryland - Child Development Laboratory/Department of Human Development, College Park, MD  20742 for assessing psychopathology in children with early-life temperament types.

The Section on Development and Affective Neuroscience (SDAN) and the Child Development Laboratory (CDL) represent two laboratories that are currently collaborating on studies of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in children.  SDAN is centered within the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program, within the NIMH-IRP while CDL is located within the Department of Human Development, University of Maryland, College Park.  These studies are designed to examine brain structure and function within temperamentally fearful children and children that are associated with various person-specific factors, including aspects of cognitive development, chronological age, and psychopathology.  The population of temperamentally fearful school-age children has been followed for several years by the CDL. The collaborative research with SDAN requires considerable data collection on the social, contextual, and cognitive status of the sample. In particular, data are needed to examine friendship and social status of the children, personality variables, and family relationships.  Moreover, maintaining contact with the sample at CDL also requires considerable effort.  This is necessary so that subjects can be readily available to participate in studies at NIH when MRI time is available.  

The CDL has considerable expertise in the collection of these types of data.  They also have considerable expertise in facilitating cooperation in collaborative, MRI-based research, specifically through a series of studies performed with NIMH.  In order for the research collaboration between CDL and SDAN to move forward it is vital that detailed questionnaire data be collected from the subjects and their families, prior to their visit to SDAN and the NIH. It is also vital that close contact be maintained with this sample.  CDL personnel have over the years established rapport with the subjects and their families and thus are in a natural and unique position to easily collect such data and to maintain contact with the sample. 

The CDL has spent the past 20 years studying two populations of children who are extreme in their temperamental disposition. In each case, these two samples of children were identified in infancy and have been followed through to either adolescence (cohort 1) or school age (cohort 2).  Very few such samples are available worldwide.  No samples are available in close proximity to the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  

The CDL has been collaborating with NIMH to study children with extreme temperaments (NIMH-IRP Protocol 03-M-0186; The Psychobiology of Temperament).  This collaboration has developed over the past 11 years. A prior contract supported collaborative work on cohort 1.  The current contract is designed to support similar collaborative work on cohort 2.  The current studies require acquiring novel clinical data on psychopathology, personality and social relationships from the sample as well as working with the sample so that they will be readily available to participate in fMRI research. It would take years to develop a new sample, and it is imperative that the current sample be tested while contact is maintained with them. NIMH has considerable contact with the sample and will over the coming period be in a position to complete unique neuroimaging studies with this sample. NIMH would not be able to contact or recruit this sample, nor acquire the necessary questionnaire data on personality and social relationships without the collaboration and work of the CDL. Therefore, it is imperative that NIMH continue its collaboration with the CDL.

The CDL will acquire a wide range of clinical data from 45 temperamentally fearful children and 45 non-fearful children who have been part of the CDL longitudinal study and to facilitate entry of these individuals into fMRI studies conducted by SDAN at the NIMH.

The Period of Performance is 12 months.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 2:00 PM E.T., May 24, 2011 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2088716 on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the Ecosystems Surveys Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Mid-Water Trawl(s).
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA/NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) conducts an annual survey to estimate the population abundance of Atlantic herring in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank regions. A pelagic trawl is used during this survey to provide scientific samples of the species composition and biology (e.g., length, weight, age, diet, maturity, and gender) of the fauna acoustically observed with scientific echo sounders. The trawl catch data are not directly utilized for abundance estimates and thus the tow duration, location, depth, and tow characteristics such as mouth opening or wing spread are not standardized for these surveys. Because the trawl data are not used in the abundance estimates, the mid-water trawl design and physical specifications has not required standardization.</p>
<p>Over the past 10-12 years, the NEFSC has used two basic types of mid-water trawls: a "high-speed rope trawl" and an "Irish herring mid-water trawl". Both have proved useful, each with its advantages and limitations. Due to a variety of factors, the NEFSC has used a hybrid of these two nets over the past two years (the "front and back ends" of the Irish trawl and the cod end of the rope trawl), and this hybrid has been successful at capturing the organisms of interest. The contractor shall design and construct a mid-water trawl. This net should be of similar design to NOAA's existing mid-water trawl with improvements in construction and material as specified.</p>
<p>This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 114119 Other Marine Fishing. The small business size standard is $4M. The solicitation and proposed fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing FAR Part 12 and the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors 1 - 3, listed in descending order of importance, when combined, are significantly more important than price: (1) Net design; (2) Experience; (3) Past Performance; and (4) Price. All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, vendors must obtain a DUNS number (this may be done by calling 1-800-333-0505) and be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov. Prospective contractors are also required to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required CCR registration. The solicitation will be available electronically on or about May 25, 2011 via FedBizOpps at www.fedbizopps.gov. Amendments to the solicitation will also be provided on the Internet using the same protocol listed above. Telephone requests for hard copies will not be honored. Hard copies of the solicitation may also be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the contractor. Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may also be faxed to (757) 664-3648. Quotes will be accepted electronically at the following email address: Roberta.H.Smith@noaa.gov and via facsimile at (757) 664-3648.</p>

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation number N00024-11-R-4312 on a sole source basis to General Dynamics, Electric Boat Corporation, 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT 06340 for the New England Maintenance Manpower Initiative (NEMMI) non-nuclear submarine services.
 The level-of-effort contract will require direct labor, supervision, administrative support, to provide intermediate and depot level overhaul, repair and modernization services in support of operational nuclear powered submarines, floating dry-docks, support and service craft, and other submarine related platforms and equipment. Work will be performed at the submarine base in New London, CT with occasional efforts at the company's shipyard in Groton, CT. The dynamics of submarine force operations require a NEMMI capable supplemental workforce comprised of Electric Boat employees located at the Naval Submarine Support Facility (NSSF), New London, CT, to accomplish operational submarine maintenance, repair and modifications to maintain fleet readiness and operational commitments.
 This requires a NEMMI contractor to be a nuclear qualified shipyard and to maintain a staff in close proximity to SUBASE, New London. The contractor must be capable of providing the necessary mix of personnel in a rapid timeframe. Electric Boat Corporation is the only source with a nuclear qualified shipyard staff within the necessary proximity to SUBASE, New London, CT capable of meeting the NEMMI requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a contract to Thales Australia Limited (Thales), Garden Island, Australia 2011, on a sole-source basis for the acquisition of one (1) Australian Acoustic Generator (AAG) and two (2) Sweep Tracker Monitor Systems (STMS4).  This acquisition is sole source for the reasons which follow.  The AAG and STMS4 are exclusively manufactured and distributed by Thales, and are proprietary to this company.  The STMS4 was designed and manufactured exclusively to interface with the AAG.  NSWC PCD has successfully evaluated this equipment for use in the U.S. Mine Countermeasures Fleet having acquired the equipment under prior contracts.
  Contracting with another company to design an alternate to this equipment would require extensive development funds already expended by Thales and would not be cost effective for the U.S. Navy.  Delivery will be to the NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL  32407.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 334419, the FSC Code is 5845.  The Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  All questions concerning this procurement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Stacy Figlinski, at Stacy.Figlinski@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Panama City, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit HDT Expeditionary Systems, Inc, on a sole source basis for the acquisition of System Expansion Kits.  These kits consist of the standard infrastructure and information technology equipment as contained in the Deployable Joint Command and Control System (DJC2).  There is a requirement for expansion kits to utilize existing system equipment design to minimize training, documentation, supportability and other integrated logistics costs.  HDT is the current provider of the DJC2 power generation and distribution equipment.  Changes in the equipment manufacturer would require significant engineering redesign.  The system load plan, power layout, power design, power distribution calculations and material planning would all require significant changes based on a review of the equipment available from other manufactures.
  Changes in the equipment manufacturer would also require significant Integrated Logistics changes.  The system training, training material, JOB AIDS, technical manuals and drawings would all require significant changes.   Based on the above this would increase the cost associated with opening this action to competition and there is no reasonable expectation that these costs can be recovered through competition.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The basis for award will be upon fair and reasonable pricing with an estimated award date on or about 11 May 2011.

<CONTACT>Andrew Flynn, Contract Specialist, Email flynn.andrew@epa.gov - Rob Flowers, Contracting Officer, Email flowers.Rob@epa.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for Support for the Metals, Minerals, and Energy Sector. With the finalization of the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy in July of 1999, the EPA introduced and outlined its risk-based air toxics program, which includes both regulatory and non-regulatory programs and actions. In addition, the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy lists the goals of the EPA's air toxics program, which are as follows: (1) reduce the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous air pollutants by 75% nationally; (2) reduce national non-cancer risks substantially; and (3) address risks which are disproportionately posed on specific subpopulations and geographic areas.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish these goals, the EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components. The first component is source specific regulatory programs. This component includes the development of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources. The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives which focus on multi-media and cumulative risk, such as the Great Water program and EPA's persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative. The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses. The fourth and final component of EPA's air toxics program is education and outreach.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs. The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities. The EPA anticipates the award of a cost-plus fixed fee, level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods. The anticipated contract award date is September 1, 2011.</p>
<p>The total duration of the proposed contracts is sixty (60) months for a total of 300,000 labor hours consisting of a base quantity of 20,000 labor hours and 40,000 optional quantity labor hours for the base year and each option period. This effort is a follow-on to contract EP-D-07-019 with EC/R which expires on August 31, 2011. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $7.0M in average annual receipts over the last three years. The draft Conflict of Interest (COI) clauses can be reviewed at EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.</p>
<p>The solicitation is scheduled to be issued on or around June 1, 2011 as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation. The solicitation and amendments will be available via the World Wide Web at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. Firms are encouraged to access the solicitation and amendments via the Internet. If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via the Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted to ensure that you have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Ethiopia is the second most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, with a 2005 population estimated at 78 million people from 83 ethnic groups and languages, in an area almost twice the size of Texas.&nbsp; There are nine ethnically based regions and two special administrative areas, one of which is the capital, Addis Ababa.&nbsp; Approximately 4% of the population lives in Addis Ababa and another 11% in scores of much smaller urban areas throughout the country.&nbsp; Approximately 85% of the population lives in rural areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Religion plays a major role in the lives of most Ethiopians:&nbsp; approximately 40%-45% of the population adheres to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; approximately 45% of the population is Muslim; and Evangelical and Pentecostal Protestantism constitute more than 10% of the population.&nbsp; To date there is remarkable religious tolerance and harmony.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The national adult HIV sero-prevalence for 2005 is estimated at 2.1%, with a 7.7% urban rate and a 0.9% rural rate.&nbsp; HIV in Ethiopia continues to be primarily urban, with wide variation in rural areas.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The HIV/AIDS Family and Community Service Health Advisor serves as Family and Community Service Cluster Coordinator (FCS) and has technical and supervisory responsibilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FCS Cluster is part of the HIV/AIDS Team in the Health, AIDS, Population and Nutrition (HAPN) Office at USAID/Ethiopia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Cluster focuses on designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating care and support programs, with emphasis on community level and family-focused responses to service delivery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Advisor will address family-centered approaches that link comprehensive and accessible health services for the HIV-infected family (PMTCT, palliative care, treatment services, etc.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The HIV/AIDS portfolio also includes home-based and palliative care, community-based counseling and testing, linkages and referrals to health facilities, home services delivery, adherence council, and food/nutritional support at the community level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Advisor plays a critical role on the HIV/AIDS Team including providing comprehensive care and support services to orphans and vulnerable children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Advisor will work to strengthen PMTCT and maternal health and child survival programming including strengthening GOE community-based initiatives such as support to Health Extension Workers (HEWs).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The incumbent will manage and supervisor a staff of five.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The incumbent fulfills a critical technical and managerial role as a cluster coordinator and participant on the PEPFAR Interagency Working Groups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent will be delegated all authorities and responsibilities commensurate with a Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and will be responsible for several assigned programs involving family and community services activities with international and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that support the achievement of PEPFAR targets.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Ethiopia is one of eight plus countries for the President's $63B Global Health Initiative.&nbsp; Building upon the priorities of the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) and the successes of the United States Government (USG) health program to date, the GHI comes at a particularly opportune time for Ethiopia. Coinciding with the launch of the GHI, the GOE has embarked on a new Health Sector Development Program IV (HSDP IV) for 2011 to 2015, which includes new and updated strategic approaches for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB), malaria, maternal child health/family planning (MCH/FP), infectious diseases, non-infectious diseases, mental health and health systems strengthening (HSS).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Therefore, the vision for Ethiopia's GHI strategy is to further collaborate with the GOE and other local partners, including NGOs and the private sector, to improve the health status of Ethiopians and specifically the most vulnerable groups of mothers, newborn and children under five.&nbsp; In this vision, GHI/Ethiopia will contribute both to the ambitious GOE goals and the overall GHI goals of reduction in maternal mortality and child mortality by 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp; Utilization of quality health care services will be improved by increasing access to high impact evidence-based integrated health services, improving specific health-seeking behaviors, and improving specific components of the health system that will have the greatest impact on morbidity and mortality outcomes.&nbsp; Reduction of maternal, neonatal, and child mortality is being prioritized in this strategy as these are the top priorities of the GOE and because the USG health team is convinced that it can successfully apply a "whole of USG approach" to these public health issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Therefore the selected applicant would be expected to work as a member of the whole USG team (USAID, CDC, Peace Corps, DOS and DOD) and collaborate in the implementation of the Global Health Implementation Plan. </span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This will be an open QPL, meaning that the Offeror will be able to submit white papers to the contracting officer at any time, although testing will only occur at the discretion of the TSA.  If initial testing finds that the product fails to meet the basic requirements, a vendor will not be permitted to retest sooner than 30 business days after the failure, unless it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  If the product fails a second test, the product will be locked out of future testing for six months, unless the Government determines it is in TSAs best interest to allow further testing.  Only Offerors who successfully complete testing will be placed on the QPL and be considered for a contract award.

Requirements for the WBI system have been broken into four tiers with progressively increasing levels of requirements.  The vendor has the choice to meet the requirements of the different tiers.  To be added to the QPL, each vendor must meet all Tier I requirements.  A higher-level system must meet all the requirements of the tiers below it.  For example, a Tier III system must meet all Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III requirements.  Potential examples of Tier I requirements include Security Technology Interface Program (STIP), privacy filters, and the ability to scan an individual in the 95th percentile for height.  The tier structure primarily reflects progressively increased requirements for performance to potentially include multiplexing and explosives detection. (see attachments for full announcement)

<DESC>The USGS, Western Coastal and Marine Geology Team, Geologic Discipline, has a requirement to lease a marine BGM-3 Gravimeter, which includes mobilization and demobilization, and technical training for two deployments:  one to the Artic aboard the Canadian Coast Guard Vessel, Louis St-Laurent (4 months); and one deployment in Puget Sound on the USGS Vessel Karluk (1 month).   Period of Performance is July through November, 2011.
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b), (1), to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA.  Marine gravimeters are highly specialized, extremely sensitive, and uncommon instruments.  The gravimeter pool maintained by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is entirely unique and the BGM-3 Gravimeter is required because data acquired by the joint US-Canada program over the past three years has been using the BGM-3 instruments, and data processing algorithms for these specific meters have been developed.  The joint US-Canada mission involves two vessels that are working in tandem, and therefore correlation of similar data sets from identical equipment is imperative.
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This is NOT an RFQ.  This does represent the Governments only written notice of this procurement. All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency.  
Place of Performance:   Menlo Park, CA
This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 05-51 (effective 1 April, 2011).
All questions regarding this procurement shall be in writing, and addressed to Cheryl Fitch at cfitch@usgs.gov no later than 05/16/2011.

<DESC>This notification is a request for information to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid, and it shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government since the Government will not pay for any cost incurred by the Contractor in providing this information. If a solicitation and award of a contractual document takes place, it may be as a new contract, against an existing delivery order contract, and/or any other contractual vehicle determined appropriate by the Government. To be considered as a potential source for this requirement, a Contractor will be required to submit data in response to any future solicitation (which would include final/official requirements that are more detailed than what is identified in this Sources Sought Synopsis). The Government does not intend to pay for any cost incurred by the Contractor in providing this information.
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) to assist the United States Air Force (USAF) in Market Research of Industry to identify potential sources that may meet requirements for Control and Reporting Center (CRC) Site Support. The CRC was formerly known as Ground Theater Air Control System (GTACS).</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to provide engineering and technical services to design three modifications to the AN/TYQ-23(V)5. These efforts include analysis of the current design, development of the new design, delivery of production representative new design hardware, validation testing within the end item, and delivery of redline revisions to existing government documentation to reflect the new design.</p>
<p>The AN/TYQ-23 Modular Control Equipment (MCE) program provides the US Air Force with a transportable automated air command and control system for controlling and coordinating the employment of aircraft and air defense weapons. The AN/TYQ-23(V)5 fielded circa 2004 and the modifications above are to address obsolescence issues that have developed since fielding. These issues have not previously been addressed.</p>
<p>The AN/TYQ-23(V)5 contains four Operator Console Units OCUs. Two of the OCUs, are master OCUs, are located on the road side of the Tactical Air Operations Module TAOM, and contain peripheral bay expansion chassis (P/N: BT404-ESY) and a VME card cage (P/N: 11VS-0615-RV21J12A-P750-LDS). The peripheral bay expansion chassis houses four removable mass media storage devices: a hard drive (P/N: TP6MD36S-KS), CD-RW drive (P/N: TP6-MPCDW-00), 8mm-tape drive (P/N: TP6-MP8MM-00), and 3.5 inch floppy drive (P/N: TP6-MPFLP-00). Each drive is removable for secure storage. The VME card cage houses the Tactical Processor Unit (P/N: V5C/N256-850). and the BUS Communications Controller (P/N: 295786-100).</p>
<p>The three design modifications address obsolescence issues with the following components of the AN/TYQ-23(V)5:<br />&bull; System Server Unit (SSU) Peripheral Suite Replacement. The purpose of this sub-task is to identify a replacement for the peripheral suite of devices that support the SSU Server Processor. The peripheral suite of devices includes a removable hard disk drive, a CD-RW drive, an 8mm Digital Audio Tape drive, a 3.5 in Floppy Disk drive, the associated peripheral docking bay, and the related power and data cables. The drives in the Peripheral Suite are Small Computer System Interface (SCSI).<br />&bull; Single Board Computer (SBC) Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) Replacement. The purpose of this task will primarily involve identification, integration, and test of a suitable replacement of the current Single Board Computers. Ideally, one SBC would be identified that could perform as either CCA (TPU or DP).<br />&bull; BUS Communication Controller (BCC) CCA Replacement. The BCC CCA is a component of the SSU. It interfaces the Digital Data Bus DDB to the Server CCA to form the primary connection between the Computer units and the SSU. The purpose of this sub-task is to develop a form, fit, function, and interface replacement for BCC (CAGE: 06481, P/N: 8940211).<br />The schedule for performance is 8 months After Receipt of Order (ARO) with the last two months reserved for Government review and contractor rework of deliveries (if required).<br /><br />SSU Peripheral Suite Replacement<br />The SSU peripheral suite replacement shall install within the existing SSU footprint (consisting of the VME rack and peripheral bay area). The design shall ensure that the required capabilities provided by the current suite are provided by the replacement suite. The design should favor the use of the VME backplane connections over front panel connections where practical. <br /><br />SBC CCA Replacement<br />In addition to being a form, fit, function &amp; interface equivalent, the replacement SBC CCA shall be fully interoperable in the AN/TYQ-23(v)5 TAOM system that may contain any combination of the original SBC CCA and the replacement SBC CCA developed under this effort.<br /><br />BCC CCA Replacement<br />In addition to being a form, fit, function &amp; interface replacement, the replacement BCC CCA shall be fully interoperable in the AN/TYQ-23(v)5 TAOM system that may contain any combination of original BCC CCA (P/N 295768-10x), the first redesigned BCC CCA (P/N 88940211-000x), and the replacement BCC CCA developed under this project.<br />Request Each Interested Contractor:</p>
<p>Please address each of the following by restating them (one at a time) and providing your response under each specific one:<br />&#61485; Address your capabilities to accomplish the service and provide highlights of successful past experience on similar government contracts within the past 10 years.

<p>DRAFT Statement of Work</p>
<p><br />TITLE: Mine Rescue Ensembles for Underground Coal Mining</p>
<p><br />I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Mine rescue operations are a high risk activity in underground coal mining. Mine rescue team members must be prepared to respond when an emergency occurs and take the necessary precautions required to ensure worker safety. It is vital that members of the teams have the capability and proper protection to immediately respond to a wide range of hazardous situations. Their ensembles need to protect them from hazards that they may encounter. In addition, mine rescue team members must know the limitations of their personal protective ensembles. The ultimate goal of this project is to protect mine rescuers from the hazards that they may face.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of an underground coal mine fire, explosion or water inundation, specially equipped and trained teams are sent underground to investigate the causes of the disaster, fight fires, rescue entrapped miners or recover the dead. Mine rescue and recovery operations are conducted under high threat, high risk conditions. The function of the mine rescue ensemble is to improve a team member's protection against the hazards of mine rescue and recovery.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to provide the basis for and recommend appropriate minimum design and performance requirements for mine rescue ensembles. This goal will be achieved by evaluating the mine rescue environment and ensembles used currently by mine rescue teams and improving personal protective technology for use during rescue. The implementation of this project will establish the guidelines for certifying protective clothing and equipment for use during mine rescue, mine emergency and recovery, resulting in more uniform and appropriate levels of protection than currently provided. The results of the project will broaden the acceptance of mine rescue protective clothing and equipment and possibly lead to new standards. Expected project end outcomes are a better equipped workforce that can respond to mine emergencies in a safe and proficient manner and thus reduce the risk of injury, illness and death. The overall project end outcomes will include: an improvement in the safety, effectiveness, confidence of mine rescue teams during emergency operations and the widespread use of improved technologies for response to mine emergencies.</p>
<p><br />II. PURPOSE</p>
<p>This research project will use the best practices learned from the fire services sector and examine mine rescue ensembles to identify existing limitations and current best practices. The primary objective of this project is to provide the basis for and to recommend appropriate minimum design and performance requirements for mine rescue ensembles. Other objectives include:</p>
<p>1. Identifying the specific hazards and use conditions related to mine rescue ensembles through literature review and meetings with mine rescue teams, trainers, and stakeholders</p>
<p>2. Determining the performance properties needed to demonstrate protective clothing effectiveness for mine rescuers during emergency operations</p>
<p>3. Communicating recommended criteria to the industry, stakeholders, standard development committees and other government agencies</p>
<p>During the initial development of the project, meetings were held with mine rescue teams, trainers, stakeholders to further define the project and assess current practices. It was found that personal protective equipment (PPE) practices for mine rescue teams differ by the type of operations (firefighting, rescue, and recovery) and by the type of organization (federal, state, and private). It was observed that there was no consistency in mine rescue ensembles worn by different teams. In other words, different teams choose different levels of protection from regular cotton/polyester work clothes to firefighter gear and different elements including, helmets, hoods, cap lamps, gloves and boots. Currently, there are no minimum requirements or nationally recognized consensus standards for personal protective clothing worn by mine rescue teams. The lack of requirements results in the potential for the individual teams to enter an emergency situation while wearing significantly different levels of protection. In addition, a single mine emergency frequently involves a mine rescue response of a mix of federal, state and local teams.</p>
<p>The experimental portion of this study will be conducted in three phases. Phase I testing will be bench-scale testing which is covered in this statement of work.</p>
<p>&bull; Phase I - The performance of the most commonly used elements of mine rescue ensembles will be tested using test methods specified in National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), ASTM International (ASTM), and American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) standards. In this phase, a range of mine rescue ensemble elements (garments, gloves, hoods, and helmets) which are currently used by U.S. underground coal mine rescue teams will be evaluated using bench-scale standardized testing that is used in the certification of PPE for firefighting and technical rescue.</p>
<p><br />III. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor will provide all labor and equipment required to complete the four tasks outlined below. Testing materials will be provided by NIOSH.</p>
<p><br />IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks to evaluate the performance of mine rescue elements.</p>
<p>The following elements of the mine rescue ensemble will be tested individually using the relevant NFPA Standards (Table 1). These elements were selected from our stakeholders based on their common use. Three NFPA standards, NFPA 1971 "Standard on Protective Ensembles for Structural Fire Fighting and Proximity Fire Fighting, 2007 Edition", NFPA 1977 "Standard on Protective Clothing and Equipment for Wildland Fire Fighting, 2011 Edition" and NFPA 1951 "Standard on Protective Ensembles for Technical Rescue Incidents, 2007 Edition" will be primarily used for evaluating the elements and element materials. In addition, applicable ASTM and AATCC standards will be used. These standards were chosen since the type and levels of the hazards, environmental conditions, activities, and protection needs of wildland firefighters (NFPA 1977) and technical rescuers (NFPA 1951) are found similar to underground coal mine rescuers based on the information collected through the literature review, field observations, and stakeholder meetings. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Table 1. Mine rescue ensemble elements which will be tested in Phase I (*)<br />Component Type-I Type-II Type-III Type-IV<br />Garments<br />(Task 1) 6.0 oz/yd2 (65/35) Polyester/Cotton 9.0 oz/yd2 FR Cotton 6.0 oz/yd2 Nomex&reg;IIIA <br />Gloves<br />(Task 2) Regular leather miner glove Nylon glove palms dipped in nitrile Technical worker glove (non FR) (96/4 Polyester/Spandex gloves with nylon coating on palms, fourchettes &amp; fingers) Firefighter glove (NFPA1971-2007 certified)<br />Hoods<br />(Task 3) 6.0 oz/yd2 Nomex&reg; 4.0 oz/yd2 Nomex&reg; 6.0 oz/yd2 80/20 FR Rayon/Nomex&reg; <br />Helmets<br />(Task 4) Low Profile Miner Helmet Regular Miner Helmet (ANSI/ISEA Z89.1-2009) <br />(*) Testing will be conducted on the most commonly used materials by mine rescue workers in the U.S. underground coal mining, which were identified through stakeholder meetings, n=1 for each type.</p>
<p><br />Preconditioning: <br />Samples of garment textile fabrics will be tested both before and after being subjected to 25 laundering and drying cycles using AATCC Test Method 135-2004 Dimensional Changes of Fabrics after Home Laundering if the test procedure specifies any laundering or drying preconditioning in the standard other than flame resistance.

<DESC>The Military Sealift Command (MSC) is responsible for providing combat logistics support to Department of Navy (DON) ships at sea, and providing strategic transportation of ocean cargo as part of the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). MSC is unique because it has administrative responsibility to both the DON and to USTRANSCOM. It therefore operates two separate Working Capital Fund (WCF) accounts - the Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) and Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) - each of which is funded from revenue generated from its buyer-seller relationship with its customers. While MSC has resources that support both of these funds, it must submit separate budgets and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) costs for each WCF. <br />
<p>The Comptroller's Office (N8) of MSC has a need to implement a new budget formulation system that will modernize MSC's current budget development process which it uses to formulate, review, and produce the MSC budget and POM for its portion of the NWCF and TWCF. The objective is for the new budget formulation system to reduce the administrative burden on MSC N8 staff, eliminate duplicate entry of budget/POM information into multiple systems, improve the analysis and justification of MSC programs, and produce required budgetary exhibits.</p>
<p>Responses to this market survey shall be submitted NLT 4:00PM (Washington DC time) on 25 May 2011.</p>

This will facilitate enhanced testing of polymeric materials and composites. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.<br /><br />NIST has a need for an upgrade of an MTS servohydraulic test machine to include 5500 lb actuator, extensometer, and laser extensometer that would meet the following functional requirements:<br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Materials and Construction Research Division of the Engineering Laboratory requires upgrade of an MTS servohydraulic test machine to include 5500 lb actuator, extensometer, and laser extensometer. The laser extensometer will require analog input card to interface with the Teststar IIs controller and cables to interface with MTS controlled Instron screw test frame. This will also require calibration and tuning of servohydraulic test machine for load control. It will require calibration of load cells (5), 2 LVDTs, an MTS controlled Instron screw test frae, and tuning of servohydraulic for load control. Actuator will use existing 3000 psi manifold (MTS 294.11) at NIST. The manifold will require new filters and piston accumulator. The manifold will require mounting hardware to mount to frame and hardware will be required to mount actuator, grips, and load cell. <br /><br />Equipment must be fully compatible and integrated with current MTS hardware, electronics, and software currently available at NIST.
<p>Relevant instrument information:<br />Servohydraulic: MTS model 312.21 22 kip load frame. Power unit is an MTS 505.07 with servohydraulic grips (MTS 647.10A). Software is Test Star Version 4.0A and Multipurpose Testware.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR  INFORMATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY
Yosemite National Park is seeking potential vendors for the following hazardous waste pickup and disposal task: NAICS Code is 562111.
This requirement is for transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste generated by Yosemite National Park in accordance with EPA regulations 40 CFR, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and Title 22 California Code of Regulations.  Yosemite National Park (YNP) operations are typical of any municipality including facility and fleet management.  Due to the amount of hazardous waste generated each month, we are considered a Large Quantity Generator (LQG) and must meet additional requirements that do not apply to most other National Park Service units.  The park normally generates 25-30 tons of waste annually with four to five shipments off site per year. Off site shipments fluctuate between one to five tons, with variable and infrequent waste streams.  Shipments are roughly on a quarterly basis from a central location, with spring and winter shipments being much lighter than summer and fall.  As a LQG we are limited to accumulating hazardous waste for 90 days at the primary location.  RCRA regulations require that a generator of hazardous waste be held responsible for every point in the waste cycle in a "cradle -to -grave" process that covers generation, storage, treatment, and disposal.  Previously, the park was involved in situations with small business hazardous waste transporters in which additional costs were incurred and EPA fines were given due to their mismanagement of the park's hazardous waste transported off-site.  
The overall contract purpose is to acquire the services of a nationally recognized company with a long-standing positive record of compliance managing hazardous wastes. The minimum need of the park is to have a reputable company that has a long standing positive record of compliance with state and federal regulations. The contractor must have the ability to handle our fluctuating waste streams, provide data managing our waste profiles, and cradle to grave tracking to ensure compliance. We prefer a contractor that owns licensed hazardous waste transporter and permitted Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) to ensure tighter control of our waste "cradle to grave".  Regulations require us to personally inspect the waste transporters facility and the TSDF to ensure compliance. Contractor shall provide personnel, labor, transportation, test equipment, packaging, materials and documentation required to legally transport hazardous waste. Contractor shall ensure that hazardous waste is properly segregated, safely packaged, labeled, documented, loaded and placarded in accordance with state and federal regulations. Contractor shall be licensed and up to date meeting all state and federal regulations for hazardous materials/waste transportation. Contractor must ensure that all Yosemite waste streams are properly managed through a licensed TSDF in accordance with state and federal laws.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />RCRA Enforcement, Permitting, and Assistance Contract (REPA 5)<br />REPA Zone II (EPA Regions 4, 5, and 6)<br /><br /></strong>This is a Sources Sought Notice only, NOT a solicitation announcement. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify if capable, qualified small businesses (including Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB)) which<br />possess the capability to support EPA's RCRA Enforcement, Permitting, and Assistance requirement in Regions 4, 5, and 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (size standard of $7,000,000 in gross annual receipts or income as defined in 13 CFR &sect; 121.104).<br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION<br /><br /></strong>EPA has a potential requirement to provide technical support services to the EPA Zone II, which is comprised of EPA Regions IV, V, and VI. The requirement would support EPA activities, as well as EPA coordinated efforts with states, tribes and other Federal agencies, at private, state and federal facilities, Indian Country, U.S. Territories, along the United States international<br />borders, and further abroad. The activities required under this contract will support the RCRA goals cited above and other programs or related Agency initiatives.&nbsp; <br /><br />Under the authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and in cooperation with our state and tribal partners, EPA manages a hazardous waste program, an underground storage tank program, and a solid waste program including development of waste reduction strategies such as recycling. The goals of the RCRA program are: 1) Protect human health and<br />the environment from the hazards posed by waste disposal; 2) Conserve energy and natural resources through waste recycling and recovery; 3) Reduce or eliminate the amount of waste generated, including hazardous waste; and, 4) Ensure that waste is managed in an environmentally safe manner.&nbsp; <br /><br />RCRA is the result of several laws. Congress passed the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) in 1965. This statute provided the basis for regulating the proper management of solid waste. The SWDA went through several major amendments resulting in the RCRA of 1976. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) in 1984 and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act of<br />1992 have also amended RCRA. <br /><br />To achieve RCRA program goals, four distinct yet interrelated programs exist under RCRA.&nbsp; Subtitle D of RCRA promotes and encourages the environmentally sound management of solid waste. It includes minimum Federal technical standards and guidelines for state solid waste plans. Subtitle C establishes a management system that regulates hazardous waste from the time it is generated until its ultimate disposal, in effect, from "cradle to grave". Subtitle I regulates petroleum products and hazardous substances (as defined under Superfund) that are stored in underground tanks. It establishes performance standards for new tanks and requires leak detection, prevention and corrective action at underground tank sites. Subtitle J regulates medical waste generation, treatment, destruction, and disposal.<br /><br />In conjunction with achieving the RCRA program goals, other programs or related Agency initiatives may be addressed within this performance work statement. This includes the following programs and initiatives: Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Toxic Substance and Control Act (TSCA), Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation Challenge (RCC), Pollution Prevention (P2), National Environmental Performance Track (NEPT), Environmental<br />Management Systems (EMS), Border 2012, Environmental Justice (EJ), National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (NEJAC), Community Based Environmental Protection (CBEP), Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know (EPCRA), RCRA Brownfields, and other new initiatives and special programs.<br /><br /><strong>ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT (LOE)<br /></strong><br />EPA estimates the potential requirement to consist of 150,000 hours, in professional labor, over a five (5) year contract.<br /><br /><strong>CAPABILITY STATEMENT:<br /></strong><br />In order to help EPA determine if this potential requirement should be set-aside for small business concerns, EPA seeking capability statements from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft Performance Work Statement. EPA will evaluate the qualifications of interested parties based on their responses regarding capability of performing the draft PWS referenced located at:<br />http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm#sources under the "RCRA Enforcement, Permitting, and Assistance Contract (REPA 5) REPA Zone II (EPA Regions 4, 5, and 6)" link.

<DESC>CHIO 11-57   User Experience Program Support Services

Request for Information VA-701-11-RI- 0086

I. Introduction:
This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.   

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for user experience program support Services.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

II. Background: 
VHA desires to return the end user, both Veteran and clinician, to the center of application design activities and to ensure that all software, purchased or developed in-house, provides a highly satisfactory user experience.  To this end, a User Experience (UX) Program is being established to develop and maintain tools, methods, resources and expertise needed to support human-centered design and usability testing of next generation health information technology (HIT) software and devices. 

For purposes of this market research, user experience is defined as " all the users' emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological responses, behaviors and accomplishments that occur before, during and after use" (ISO FDIS 9241-210). The UX Program will optimize both clinician and Veteran user experience with HIT by designing system user interfaces (UI) that enhance effectiveness, minimize mental load, support clinician decision making, maximize clinical workflow efficiency, improve patient safety and enhance quality of care. 

Much of the user experience work will be conducted in the UX Lab, located near the Vanderbilt campus in Nashville, TN, and  part of an Innovation, Research, and Design facility.   The lab contains an 'Exploratorium' for simulating various clinical settings, workshop spaces with interactive whiteboards for conducting conceptual design and affinity diagram sessions, and classrooms suited for creating visual simulations of UI designs. A state of the art usability lab with dual participant rooms enables the observation of care team collaboration when testing home tele-health, virtual medicine, and collaborative care systems. 

VHA will leverage the UX Lab's human-centered design and usability testing capabilities to ensure that user experience, as opposed to technical features, serves as the basis of next-generation HIT systems design. The benefits associated with adopting these design principles include:
"	Improving the usability of the system design
"	Increasing clinician effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction
"	Increasing clinician acceptance and Veteran adoption of HIT
"	Assessing feasibility and impact of integrating information technologies into specific healthcare settings.
"	Decreasing user error rates
"	Ensuring inclusion of necessary product features and avoiding unnecessary product features 
"	Simplifying design documentation and user-facing publications 
"	Expediting design and development through properly conceived and applied best practices and guidelines 
"	Reducing development time and costs due to unclear or inaccurate requirements
"	Decreasing training and support costs
"	Decreasing post-deployment redesign efforts


III. Requirements:  
EHT seeks support for the full range of user experience activities.  Deliverables produced under this contract will vary widely depending on the task but will include items such as, but not limited to, written reports, video clips, wireframes, affinity diagrams, visual models of user interface design, interactive multimedia demonstrations, functional prototypes, and presentations.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Air Force Safety Center, Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract FA9401-07-D-0003 which expires on 6 May 11. The bridge contract will consist of a four (4) month basic period of performance with four 1-month options. The AFNWC/PKOC (formerly 377th Contracting Squadron) intends to make an award to UNIVERSAL TECHNICAL RESOURCE SERVICES (UTRS), 950 KINGS HWY N STE 208, CHERRY HILL, NJ 08034-1518. Interested parties may e-mail susan.mcdaniel@kirtland.af.mil or fax 505-846-5744, Attn: Susan McDaniel, not later than 1 April 2011, 3:00 p.m. MST.
<p>IAW FAR Part 5.207(c)15(ii), the proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302. All responsible parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the government. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements, proposals, or quotations received within five (5) business days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. Responsible parties must clearly demonstrate in the submitted documents that there will be no service interruptions and no added investment and start-up costs associated with award of a bridge contract to any contractor other than the incumbent contractor. Documentation submitted will not exceed five (5) pages and will be submitted electronically to the cognizant Contracting Officer listed in the first paragraph above. A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>The nature of this bridge contract is to provide MAJCOM Commanders uninterrupted proactive flight safety mishap analyses for four (4) month basic period of performance with four 1-month options. In that short period of time, any contractor other than the incumbent (UTRS) would incur start-up costs and ramp-up transition time to meet the current contract's requirements. Those significant costs to hire subject matter experts with experience flying military aircraft would not be recouped in such a short contract period. Also, the transition ramp-up period will require one to two months under this contract period and would disrupt critical aircraft schedule downtime and loss of a crucial safety capability. If this eight month bridge contract effort were awarded to any other contractor than the incumbent, that contractor would not transition quickly into performing real time safety analyses for aircraft that have been scheduled for evaluation by MAJCOM Commanders. The impact would be a disruption of schedules and services and severely impact flight safety that MAJCOM Commanders depend on for mission planning. A bridge contract with the incumbent for four (4) month basic period of performance with four 1-month options would provide time to allow the awarding of the follow-on effort and not disrupt mission schedules.</p>
<p>In summary, several contractors can perform these services on a long-term basis as the October 2010 sources sought indicates; however, there is only one (1) contractor (UTRS) who appears to be capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

<a href="mailto:dawn.montgomery@conus.army.mil">Fort Bliss DOC</a>
<DESC>Vendor Demonstration Opportunity<br><br>This Mission and Installation Contracting Command Fort Bliss is hosting a Mock Training Special Effects Industry Day on 1-2 June 2011.  The intent for this event is to allow vendors to provide demonstrations or information on their products focused on training aids for live fire targetry concepts, battlefield effects, and training aids.  We anticipate holding an open forum discussion setting on Day 1 to discuss contracting strategies, industry standards, and the command vision.  This will be an opportunity for contractors and Army personnel to network and share ideas.  A representative from several installation offices will attend and give a presentation on the proposed vision and the business model for contracting.   <br>All suggestions are welcome to make this a worthwhile event for everyone.   All interested vendors/contractors are invited to RSVP their attendance as space will be limited for the event due to the fact that this event is scheduled for just 2 days.  We have limited space and time for booths/Tables/Presentation/ Demonstrations.  Vendors that have previously RSVP's will be given the first opportunity for reservations.  <br><br>Day One - 1 June 2011<br>The first day will begin at approximately 8:00 AM with round table discussions followed by static displays that provide the visitor literature about the product and an opportunity for a "hands-on" experience.  <br><br>Day Two - 22 June 2011<br>The second day will consist of demonstrations of products that may require more space than the previous day's venue, scheduled by vendor for an audience of military and civilians.  The second day will be conducted on a range or area on East Fort Bliss that will allow for pyrotechnics and remotely operated devices to be used; it will not support live-fire demonstrations that would include projectiles or bullets to be used.  <br>The goal of the event is to develop best practices for future contract solicitations for the equipment, supplies, services listed in the following pages.  In these days of constricting budgets, Fort Bliss is looking for ways to provide cutting edge realistic training "Better, Faster, Cheaper, and Safer."  <br><br>TARGETS<br>Fort Bliss is looking at options for remotely controlled mobile in two categories, man-size and vehicle-size.   They should both have locator systems that allow a user to locate the target among several structures even though out of line of sight.<br>	The man size targets will be remotely controlled from up to one km away.  Both of these types should also be equipped to allow the operator to interact with the Soldiers executing the ranges.   <br>		-The first type will be basically a mannequin target that can be moved by two or more wheels independent of some kind of track and across non-paved surfaces.  The target should be able to be engaged by up to 7.62mm rounds.  The movement system does have to be hardened against small arms as well.  The movement system should allow the target to negotiate three to four inch high obstacles, enter a ground level building or move across unpaved desert terrain.<br>		-The second type of target should be stationary falling man targetry, mannequin-type targets linked to a mechanism that allows for the target to fall once it has been engaged.  The mechanism should have a varying sensitivity, the capability to be set to fall after being hit one to three times.  This mechanism should be unobtrusive, hidden within in the mannequin wearing a robe or other garment. <br>	  The vehicular targets will be in at least two pieces, the movement system and the shell.  The movement system should be hardened to withstand up 7.62mm rounds.  It should have a top speed of at least 25 mph and be either diesel or electrically driven.  The system will be remotely controlled from up to one to two kilometers away.  It should have position location ability in order to allow the operator to ascertain its location in reference to the range upon which it is being operated.  The shell should be easily attached and unattached from the movement system by two personnel.  The shells should be available in a mix of configurations from civilian cars or trucks to commonly found military equipment.  <br><br>CASUALTY TRAINING AIDS<br>Fort Bliss is looking for combat casualty training aids, something that more closely replicates combat wounds than the standard moulage kits.  These aids include live tissue replication and amputation.  These aids would allow Soldiers to wear wound-replicating attachments that would allow the responding personnel to do more than just evaluate the casualty.  The first responders should be able to begin to treat the casualty and see results.  More complex treatment apparatus would allow medically trained Soldiers to conduct evaluations on a living patient that replicates organ and soft tissue damage.  <br><br>TRAINING BUILDINGS<br>Fort Bliss is also looking for temporary, easily transportable, and easily assembled training aids that replicate small buildings from Afghanistan, the Middle East, and rural Africa.  The exterior and interior should replicate the look and texture of various building materials like brick, cinder block, adobe, mud, wood, bamboo, straw, thatch, etc.  These aids may or may not have floors but must have roofs.  Ideally the training aids would be stackable and able to be palletized and designed for movement by truck or towed across rough terrain into locations.  These aids should be configurable or scalable in size and number to provide various size units varying experiences.  They must be easily assembled/disassembled by 2-4 persons using minimal hand tools, able to be procured in a mixture of buildings that resemble Afghanistan and Iraqi village structures, have (2) doors and (2) window openings, with each door being "breachable" and replaceable at low cost, have a hidden compartment for a weapons cache, made of long-lasting materials suitable for year-round military training, and include installation and training for first iteration of set up.<br><br>BREACHING DOORS/ WALL SECTIONS<br>Fort Bliss is interested in training aids for breaching operations.  The overarching intent is to reduce repair time, time spent replacing training aids between iterations, and increase realism over current methods.  The feedback to the Soldier/user requires training aids that will give realistic feedback in resistance and operation to those found in theater.  The overall cost would be realized between saved man-hours and, over time, the replacement cost of alternative doors even though the initial dollar amount will be more than a hollow-core door.  <br>The doors must be "scalable" to replicate doors of differing security levels, closed (latched), locked, and dead-bolted.  The doors and frames should be parts of the same system to alleviate any compatibility issues.  The doors should be breachable along the hinges or lock plate by pry, ram, shotgun (up to two-shot hinges and lock), hydraulic means, and/or explosives.  The doors will be reusable, not needing to be replaced, after being breached by explosives up to C2.  There may be different types of doors; a door may meet two of the five different types.  These doors will be able to open in either direction.<br>The breachable wall sections should be a "plug" that can be used in an existing mud, brick, stone, or wooden wall that will allow Soldiers to explosively breach resulting in damage to that section only.  The rest of the wall will be undamaged and returning it to its "un-breached" appearance will be done by replacing the plug.  The plug can be produced in varying sizes, small squares or entire height-of-the-wall sections.<br><br>VISUAL MODIFICATIONS TO HMMWVS<br>Fort Bliss is looking for easily applied and removed visual modification packages for M998 HMMWVs to replicate civilian cargo trucks of a type found in Afghanistan and in the Middle East in general.  Unlike the VISMODs used at the CTCs these would replicate civilian vehicles not OPFOR or Russian produce military equipment.  <br><br>BATTLEFIELD EFFECTS <br><br>Fort Bliss is looking for a way to replicate battlefield effects in regards to perceived threat without the dangers of producing casualties.  RPGs, mines, IEDs, VBIEDs, suicide vests, and artillery impact simulations are examples of the effects for which we are looking.  These effects will need to be able to be conducted in safely close proximity to Soldiers in day/night and all weather conditions.  They will provide an immersive environment in which Soldiers will be exposed to a level of realism that is not currently available.<br>The solicitation would call for the contractor to provide subject matter experts and associated equipment and material to perform these effects as necessary for units' training for a period of 12 months with an option for an additional 12 months.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Biomaterials Group of the Polymers Division, Material Measurement Laboratory, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.501(a), with Toptica Photonics, Inc., Victor NY, for the purchase of a broadband, dual-pulse fiber laser (FemtoFiber pro NIR UCP). <br /><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The laser system will be used as an excitation light source of a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy apparatus, which is to be used for high-speed, noninvasive and quantitative spectral imaging of biological tissues and cells. The excitation light source must have a footprint of less than or equal to (4 X 4) feet, and have two pulsed light outputs that are synchronized with timing jitter less than 1 femtosecond (10-15 s). One pulse (the Stokes pulse) must contain at least 2800 cm-1 of bandwidth and be compressible to at most 25 fs in order to efficiently populate vibrational coherence within the sample. The Stokes pulse must also be in the range (900 to 1400) nm in order to avoid multiphoton-induced cell damage, and light absorption by water. The second pulse (the probe pulse) must have a ~ 1 picosecond (10-12 s) duration in order to probe the vibrational coherence with sufficient spectral resolution. This pulse must have temporal edges that rise and fall with time constants no longer than 100 fs in order to measure reference spectra on the fly, and it must be centered somewhere in the spectral range (700 to 800) nm in order to be sufficiently spectrally separated from the Stokes pulse without inducing cell damage. This laser system will enable noninvasive, near-video rate spectroscopic imaging of cells and tissues, which is a key deliverable in the Bio-Imaging Project.
<p>Toptica Photonics, Inc., is the only vendor capable of providing the required broadband, dual-pulse laser source in order to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. Toptica Photonics, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 24, 2011, 3:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Conference, Event, and Meeting Support Services</strong></p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose<br /></span>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research and gather information from industry on conference, event, and meeting planning and support for EPA offices and regions across the country. The EPA's goal is to establish a strategic approach to acquiring and providing such services.</p>
<p>This RFI is solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation. The U.S. Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission. The U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span>Each year the EPA sponsors hundreds of conferences and events across the country. The majority of these events are in the 250 - 2,000 person range. These events are critical to the successful execution of the Agency's mission and act as a forum for collaborative problem solving as well as conveying essential information to a variety of audiences. Currently services for planning and executing these events are acquired in a variety of ways by individual offices and personnel across the Agency. EPA believes there is a more efficient and cost effective way to acquire these services.</p>
<p><strong>Through this RFI, EPA is seeking input and suggestions from industry about conference, event and meeting planning and support services in order for EPA to make decisions about structuring a strategic acquisition solution for these services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>EPA seeks feedback from industry on the general description below as well as suggestions or other responses to help optimize the way EPA acquires these services. EPA also seeks responses to several specific questions listed after the description below.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Description <br /></span>EPA envisions engaging several companies in the conference/event planning industry to help optimize current conference and event preparation and execution in order to minimize costs and maximize efficiency and attendee experience.</p>
<p>Issues and services that EPA envisions contractor(s) handling may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing event planning and coordination services<br />&bull; Identifying and securing event facilities, audio-visual support, supplies and equipment <br />&bull; Identifying and securing event speakers<br />&bull; Identifying and securing lodging for participants<br />&bull; Identifying and arranging for appropriate food or refreshments as allowed by federal regulation<br />&bull; Providing program/agenda support <br />&bull; Providing registration and related on-site support<br />&bull; Providing document preparation support <br />&bull; Providing graphic support and photography<br />&bull; Creating and managing an on-line interface for EPA offices to review available options, choose from a variety of services, and perform information exchanges electronically.<br />&bull; Providing on-line participant registration<br />EPA further envisions contracting with companies that understand Federal regulations, protocols and issues affecting Federal conference/event management, including:<br />&bull; Federal travel regulations <br />&bull; The Federal Acquisition Regulation<br />&bull; Green meeting best practices and requirements (e.g., GSA Guidance for Sustainable TDY Policies and Practices www.gsa.gov/graphics/ogp/FTRbulletin10-06.doc, EPA Green Meetings and Conferences http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/octqtr/48cfr1523.703-1.htm, etc.) <br />&bull; Remote meetings<br />&bull; Regulations and policies concerning registration, refreshments and other relevant areas (for example, see Attachments 1 and 2). <br />&bull; Fee-based conferences or similar "no cost" arrangements in accordance with section 5.B of EPA Order #900-3 (see Attachment 1).<br />Questions for Industry<br />As part of its market research EPA is requesting industry input on the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Please discus the positive and negative aspects of creating a single over-arching contract vs. multiple contract vehicles. Please be advised that we believe that this service lends itself to developing a strategic sourcing acquisition solution.</p>
<p>2. Please discuss the challenges associated with planning and executing conferences/events of a small, medium and large nature.</p>
<p>3. In the conferencing/event planning arena, what are the typical demographics (size standard, socio-economic categories, geographic location and coverage) for companies that perform this type of work?</p>
<p>4. Please discuss the specific issues that would make a solicitation for this work especially desirable -- or undesirable -- to companies considering competing for the work.</p>
<p>5. Please discuss standard industry practices, and your company's best practices, in providing these services.</p>
<p>6. Please discuss any effective performance-based results associated with providing these services of which you might be aware.</p>
<p>7. Please discuss options for maximizing green meeting and events (e..g, ASTM/APEX Green Meetings and Events Standard, Convention Industry Council's Accepted Practices Exchange Panel on Green Meeting and Event Practices, the Green Meeting Industry Council, etc.)</p>
<p>8. Optional: Attached please find a sample EPA event (see Attachment 3). Please provide your ideas on how to plan and execute this sample event.</p>
<p>9. Please provide any other information you think EPA might find useful in competing and acquiring these services.<br />How to Respond</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span><br />Each year the EPA sponsors hundreds of conferences and events across the country. The majority of these events are in the 250 - 2,000 person range. These events are critical to the successful execution of the Agency's mission and act as a forum for collaborative problem solving as well as conveying essential information to a variety of audiences. Currently services for planning and executing these events are acquired in a variety of ways by individual offices and personnel across the Agency. EPA believes there is a more efficient and cost effective way to acquire these services.</p>
<p><strong>Through this RFI, EPA is seeking input and suggestions from industry about conference, event and meeting planning and support services in order for EPA to make decisions about structuring a strategic acquisition solution for these services. </strong></p>
<p><strong>EPA seeks feedback from industry on the general description below as well as suggestions or other responses to help optimize the way EPA acquires these services. EPA also seeks responses to several specific questions listed after the description below. </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Description <br /></span>EPA envisions engaging several companies in the conference/event planning industry to help optimize current conference and event preparation and execution in order to minimize costs and maximize efficiency and attendee experience.</p>
<p>Issues and services that EPA envisions contractor(s) handling may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing event planning and coordination services<br />&bull; Identifying and securing event facilities, audio-visual support, supplies and equipment <br />&bull; Identifying and securing event speakers<br />&bull; Identifying and securing lodging for participants<br />&bull; Identifying and arranging for appropriate food or refreshments as allowed by federal regulation<br />&bull; Providing program/agenda support <br />&bull; Providing registration and related on-site support<br />&bull; Providing document preparation support <br />&bull; Providing graphic support and photography<br />&bull; Creating and managing an on-line interface for EPA offices to review available options, choose from a variety of services, and perform information exchanges electronically.<br />&bull; Providing on-line participant registration<br />EPA further envisions contracting with companies that understand Federal regulations, protocols and issues affecting Federal conference/event management, including:<br />&bull; Federal travel regulations <br />&bull; The Federal Acquisition Regulation<br />&bull; Green meeting best practices and requirements (e.g., GSA Guidance for Sustainable TDY Policies and Practices www.gsa.gov/graphics/ogp/FTRbulletin10-06.doc, EPA Green Meetings and Conferences http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/octqtr/48cfr1523.703-1.htm, etc.) <br />&bull; Remote meetings<br />&bull; Regulations and policies concerning registration, refreshments and other relevant areas (for example, see Attachments 1 and 2). <br />&bull; Fee-based conferences or similar "no cost" arrangements in accordance with section 5.B of EPA Order #900-3 (see Attachment 1).<br />Questions for Industry<br />As part of its market research EPA is requesting industry input on the following questions:</p>

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development(ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory(NRMRL) located at 68 W. Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, Oh intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University of Cincinnati  to assist the EPA in conducting in-house research studying the fate of transport of nanoparticles in aquatic and soil systems. This project is intended to study the fate and transport of nanoparticles in aquatic and soil systems.  The primary difference between ambient and engineered nanoparticles is that the former have widely varying shapes, sizes, and compositions, whereas the latter are single, uniform compounds.  We are using silica as a model for naturally occurring nanomaterials, whereas titanium oxide, cerium oxide and zinc oxide for engineered particles having varying reactive properties.  The research focuses on comparing nanoparticles that occur naturally with engineered ones based on their mobility in soil systems, aggregation and dissolution to increase the understanding on the fate of nanoparticles.  The mobility of nanoparticles through porous media and their tendency to aggregate or agglomerate to form larger macro-scale particles will be experimentally evaluated under different conditions.  Mobility of nanoparticle could affect the effectiveness of water treatment technology such filtration and physical interactions between the particles themselves and the environment.  The influence of these accumulated nanomaterials on contaminants mobility and soil remediation technologies such as encapsulation techniques will also be investigated.  Understanding physical and chemical interactions nanoparticles with contaminants and natural organic matter such as humic acid would help us assess the fate of nanoparticles in the environment.  This could also lead to the use of nanomaterials for in-situ soil treatment technolo gies for dissolved phase plume treatment. 
The contractor will be required to provide state of the art facilities and equipment necessary to perform the study of the fate and transport of nanoparticles in aquatic and soil systems for use by EPA researchers and post docs within a 30 mile radius of the EPA AWBERC facility, located at 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268.
The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541620.  The size standard for this code is $7 million.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability of meeting EPA requirements by submitting technical documentation to Garry A. Plear, Contract Specialist, at the office identified above, by e-mail plear.garry@epa.gov. The technical documentation must establish that the instrument to be provided meets all requirements.  Anticipated award date will be in May 2011.  Documentation must be submitted to Garry A. Plear by 3:00 PM, May 16, 2011 in order to be considered by EPA.

Increase parent participation in their child's learning and expectations for academic achievement; 4. Support and celebrate the unique cultural and linguistic diversity of each American Indian community served by the program; and 5. Promote lifelong living.BIE has experienced notably results applying a family literacy model founded in parent child contact to achieve FACE goals.  This acquisition is intended to continue that type of service.2.  BACKGROUNDIn 1990 the Bureau of Indian Education initiated the Family and Child Education (FACE) program, an integrated model for an American Indian early childhood/parental involvement program. The FACE program supports the national educational goals identified in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) and the BIE goals and mission, which is to provide quality education opportunities from early childhood through life in accordance with the Tribe's needs for cultural and economic well-being in keeping with the wide diversity of Indian Tribes and Alaska Native person, taking into account the spiritual, mental, physical and cultural aspects of the person within a family and Tribal or Alaska Native village context.  The FACE program primarily serves families with children from prenatal to 5 years of age by providing early childhood education, adult education, and parenting services.  Additionally, continuing opportunities for active learning and parent involvement are provided to families with children in grades K-3.  The FACE program is designed to serve families with children, prenatal to age 5, in home- and center-based settings located within a Bureau of Indian Education school.  Families may receive services in one or both settings.  Families who receive personal visits are referred to as home-based families; families who participate in adult education and early childhood education services at BIE funded schools are referred to as center-based families.  The FACE program design is implemented through a collaborative effort of the BIE and contract support services.Program Information: Inclusive of agenda, strategies, techniques, best practices, forms, prior year newsletter.Since the 1990 implementation of FACE, BIE has seen notable successes to include: 1. Almost all FACE preschoolers demonstrated improvement in language and literacy (92%) and social studies (90%). 2. One-half of FACE preschoolers with pre- and post-assessments demonstrated gains in all seven domains; and 3. One-fourth of adults advance at least one level in reading 30% and advance one level in mathematics during the year.3. Scope / Mission of the AcquisitionTo receive the curriculum, educational expertise, and technical resources to affect a positive Parent Child relationship that furthers family literacy and the other four goals stated in Section 1.0 Purpose of the Acquisition.4.

GLOSSARYHome-based Services: Training and technical assistance is provided for home-based services, which are delivered by parent educators to families with children prenatal to 3 years of age, although some families with children 3-5 years of age also receive home-based services.  The primary goal of home-based service providers (parent educators) is to support parents in their role as their child's first and most influential teacher.  Family literacy is an important focus of home-based services.  Service typically is delivered through personal visits, family group meetings, periodic screening of overall development of the child, and referrals to school and community services. Center-based Services: These services have a pre-school, an adult education, and a PACT.  Pre-school Component: Training and technical assistance is provided for center-based services, which are offered in BIE-funded elementary school facilities, to 3 to 5 year-old children and their parents.  Services are offered four days a week.  Early childhood education is provided for children in a developmentally appropriate preschool setting using the High/Scope approach in which literacy development is emphasized and children are involved in active learning.  Early Childhood Standards for 7 established domains are implemented to facilitate a smooth transition for children from FACE preschool to kindergarten.  They describe a range of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors that children are expected to have developed by the end of preschool years.  Literacy is an important focus of center-based services. Adult Education Component: Adult education addresses the academic needs of the adult who participates with the child, enhances and supports parenting skills, educational goals, and addresses employability skills.  Educational services are customized in response to formal assessments.Parent and Child Time (PACT): A designated time for adult and child to interact in the early childhood setting.Parent:  An adult who plays a significant and meaningful role in the child's life on a day-to-day basis more than 7 hours a day.6.

The Offeror shall provide their quote to provide this service.  16.1 Offer Submission Guidelines The contractor shall submit a written proposal in two Volumes. Volume I is the Technical Volume and Volume II is the Price Volume.  Volume 1: Technical Volume of the successful offeror will be the section that replaces the SOO at award.Each volume shall be clearly marked as to the volume number, section number, subsection number (if applicable), solicitation number, and offeror's name. Each volume shall contain a glossary of any abbreviations and acronyms used with an explanation of each. Each volume shall be written on a stand-alone basis so that its contents may be evaluated with minimal cross-referencing to other volumes of the proposal. Information needed for proposal evaluation not found in its designated volume will be assumed to have been omitted from the proposal. Cross-referencing within a proposal volume is permitted where it would conserve space without impairing clarity. Failure to provide all requested information may render a proposal unacceptable. 16.2	 STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVESThe Government has described its requirement using a Statement of Objectives (SOO) format as defined in FAR 37.602(c).  Consistent with FAR 37.602(c) the SOO section (i.e.  Section 6) will be replaced with the successful offeror's approach.  The Government believes there are opportunities to apply innovation and efficiencies to achieving its stated objectives within stated constraints.  Offerors are expected to submit a proposal that clearly explains the performance objectives and measureable standards it will achieve to accomplish the stated SOO.  The offeror should also clearly state what it expects from Government involvement in the accomplishment of the offerors proposed approach.  16.3	Contents of Proposals Volume I: Technical VolumeSection A(1) Home Based services is limited to 20 pages, excluding the example assessment tool(s). Section A(2) Center Based services is limited to 25 pages, excluding the example assessment tool(s). Section B(1) Home Based services -  Resumes are limited to 2 pages for each person. Section B(2) Center Based services - Resumes are limited to 2 pages for each person. Section C(1) Home Based services - Experience is limited to 5 pages. Section C(2) Center Based services - Experience is limited to 5 pages. Volume II: Price VolumeSection A Subsection 1 (Proposal Cover Letter) is limited to 1 electronic page Section A Subsection 2 Representation and Certifications 52.212-3 completed Section B (Past Performance) is limited to 5 electronic pages Section C (Socio-Economic Considerations) is limited to 5 electronic pages Section D (Price) LINE ITEM schedule completed Factor 1: Technical Capability: Factor 1a. The Technical Approach shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary but limited to the page constraints, to fully explain the quoted technical approach. The technical quote should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work to be performed and include measurable performance standards by which performance will be evaluated for determining whether the offeror performed successfully. The quote shall include the offeror's understanding of the Bureau of Indian Education's goals for the project and an understanding of the SOO. The quote should include, but not be limited to the following:-Knowledge and understanding of the requirements outlined in the SOO.-Understanding of general and local conditions which can affect the SOO.-Demonstrated ability of contractor to accomplish the objectives stated in the SOO within the constraints identified. -Example of assessment tool(s) proposed to be used for early intervention; at least one but not more than three.Factor 1b: Resumes: The contractor shall demonstrate corporate knowledge and experience by submitting resumes for key personnel. Key personnel are defined as those individuals the offeror views as essential to successfully performing its proposal technical approach.  The offeror shall provide at minimum 3 resumes and no more than 7 resumes of individuals offered as key personnel.  The Government will look more favorably on personnel with direct experience supporting Bureau of Indian Education entities.Factor 1c: Experience: The offeror shall describe the relevance of the past performance it is providing under Factor 2: Past Performance. Specifically, the contractor shall demonstrate its knowledge of BIE, as well as the schools and tribal entities it supports. The offeror must demonstrate that they have experience performing Home based and/or Center based support consistent with the BIA FACE program objectives or with other efforts similar in size, scope, and complexity of this requirement.Factor 2: Past Performance: The Past Performance quote shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary to fully explain the quoted past performance. The contractor must demonstrate (provide reference and phone numbers) that they have developed and brought to completion activities as described in this SOO. Examples must be recent, having been performed in the last 3 years. The offer must describe how its past performance is on a scale similar in size to the requirement of this requirement. Factor 3: Price: The Government will evaluate each offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness. The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. Unrealistically high (or low) pricing in the initial or revised proposal may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition - either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. The Government will review (1) proposed prices to determine whether they are materially unbalanced; and (2) any unbalanced offer to assess the associated risks to the Government in awarding to such an offeror, and whether award will result in unreasonably high or low price for contract performance. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. The Government will determine each offer's total evaluated price by summing the base year and all option periods. Award at each option year will be based on the funds available.  Quotes will be submitted in writing and signed by an individual with the authority to bind their respective company.   Price proposal should include cost buildup details that identify direct cost elements, (e.g. labor, materials, travel, subcontracts, etc), indirect cost elements, (e.g. labor overhead, general and administrative expense, etc), and profit.  The price should be inclusive of any Federal, State, and Local taxes.  The detail should include sufficient descriptions to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the realism of the offeror's price and to determine the reasonableness of the price submitted.The Government, at a minimum, expects a payment schedule that is on a firm fixed price monthly amount for all of the services.  However, the offeror may propose for Government consideration a firm fixed price payment schedule that further breaks down the monthly services and is aligned to its proposed approach. 16.6 Proposal Acceptance Period Notwithstanding FAR clause 52.212-1, the proposal acceptance period is 90 days after the date set for receipt of proposals. The Offeror shall make a clear statement in the proposal cover page that the proposal is valid until this period has ended.17	Evaluation (see attachment /02)

The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:
(1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;

(4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel;
(5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and,
(6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.
(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden compliance with the boycott, and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above:<BR><BR>(1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:
(i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,
(ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;
(2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;
(3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;
(4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;
(5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individuals family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,
(6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.<BR><BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision:
Foreign person means any person other than a United States person as defined below.
United States person means any United States resident or national (other than an individual resident outside the United States and employed by other than a United States person), any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic establishment of any foreign concern), and any foreign subsidiary or affiliate (including any permanent foreign establishment) of any domestic concern which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern, as provided under the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended.

(1) Taking or knowingly agreeing to take any action, with respect to the boycott of Israel by Arab League countries, which Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)) prohibits a United States person from taking; or,
(2) Discriminating in the award of subcontracts on the basis of religion.<BR><BR>Questions must be submitted by May 16, 2011. Questions submitted after the deadline may not be considered.<BR><BR>

<DESC><strong>BACKGROUND:<br /></strong>During the initial closing (3/29/2011) of the 72 inch drain gate for the Elkwater Fork RCC Dam, the stem guides slipped allowing the gate stem to move out of vertical alignment. It is possible that too much torque was applied to the gate after it reached the bottom position. The pedestal for the gate crank assembly moved enough to crack a 5 inch high grout base installed between the top of dam and the bottom of the pedestal base plate.&nbsp;<br /><br />NRCS is requesting quotations&nbsp;to inspect the gate stem, fix damage done during the initial closing, tighten loose bolts, replace damaged bolts, and vertically align the stem. The damage was observed on April 8, 2011 during the first opening of gate with head and subsequent attempt to re-close the gate.
<p><strong>SCOPE OF WORK:<br /></strong>The work consists of all work related to the proper adjustment of the gate stems and guides to ensure the gates operate properly. The work includes vertical alignment of the 72-inch gate stem; lubrication of stem; inspection of stem and related components; replacement of grout pad; checking and tightening nuts; providing clear plastic stem covers; providing lock washers; and work as further described below. Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, and materials to restore the 72-inch drain gate to proper working order as defined by this statement of work.</p>
<p>All work related to the alignment of the stem for the 72-inch gate shall be done according to the Installation, Operation, &amp; Maintenance Manual for Cast Iron Slide Gates, by Hydro Gate, 6-28-2010 which is provided with this solicitation.<br /><br /><br />This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and Quotations&nbsp;are being requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A Request for Quotation form (SF-18) along with all relevant solicitation documents&nbsp;are&nbsp;attached to this notice.<br /><br />This is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The applicable NAICS Code is 811310, with a business size standard of $7M.</p>
<p>All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to being awarded a BPA. Detailed information about CCR is available at www.ccr.gov. The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at 1-888-227-2423.</p>

Should a deceased leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the shelter will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs office and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from the Department of Veterans Affairs concerning disposition.

b. It is agreed that the facility will notify Orlando VA Medical Center immediately when a medical emergency requiring hospitalization occurs.  It is agreed that the veterans will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility.  When such readmission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal hospital may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to the VA hospital will be accomplished promptly.

c. The facility agrees and warrants that it does not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color or national origin.  The shelter may neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, etc.  It is agreed that the Department of Veterans Affairs will have the right the center and all appurtenances by an authorized representative(s) designated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, to determine whether acceptable standards are maintained and adequate care is being rendered.

d. The facility agrees to accept referral of and to provide all services specified in this contract for any person determined eligible by the Chief Medical Director or his designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered. 

12. Payments:

a. Per diem will generally be paid for the day of admission or the day of discharge from the program, but not for both.
b. Payment for shelter settings is made on a monthly basis, for services rendered.

c. Payments made by the Orlando VA Medical Center under this contract will constitute the total cost of room and board and personal hygiene items.  The shelter agrees that no additional charges will be billed to the beneficiary or his family, either by the residential treatment center or any third party furnishing services or supplies required for such care. 

d. If a beneficiary is admitted to and discharged in the same calendar day, 
payment will be made for one day.

e. Should a patient referred to the facility be absent in an unauthorized manner, payment for services for that veteran may be continued for a period of 2 days, provided there is an active outreach attempt on the part of the shelter staff to return the veteran to the shelter and strong likelihood that the patient will return.

Absences of the patient from the facility in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable except with the prior approval of the MAS officer.

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (Jun 2008) ADDENDUM <br />52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998) <br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this Internet address http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html <br />(End of provision)<br />52.204-4 Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Recycled Paper (Aug 2000) <br />52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008) <br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are ( ) are not ( )presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have ( )have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have ( ), have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. </span></p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) # GS-05P-11-FA-C-0031<br />HOTEL, DINING, AND AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION<br />Facilities Management (FM) TRAINING FORUM
<p><strong>PROPOSED DATES HAVE BEEN MADE FLEXIBLE FOR THE WEEK OF JUNE 27TH. SEE AMENDMENTS 0001 AND 0002, BELOW<br /></strong><br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses which are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-51. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6 million.</p>
<p>A. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS<br />Funds are not presently available for award. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. No legal liability on the part of the Government may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Vendors shall include the details of their cancellation terms and conditions with their offer. Offerors are advised to submit their best terms and conditions now, as the government reserves the right to award based on initial offers without conducting negotiations.</p>
<p>B. IDENTIFICATION<br />The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Great Lakes Region, Organizational Resources Division (ORD), 230 S. Dearborn, Ste. 3500, Chicago, IL, intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, meeting space, meals, and audio/visual (A/V) event production services for general session presentations and approximately 20-25 separate breakout session presentations (5-6 time slots of four sessions each) for the Property Management Service Centers (PMSC) and Facilities Management Services Program (FMSP) "Facilities Management (FM) Training Forum," which must accommodate 200 attendees.</p>
<p>C. OBJECTIVES <br />The Great Lakes GSA FM Training Forum serves as the primary mechanism to train and recognize associates responsible for federal property management region wide. The workshop also offers training in property management techniques and business process improvement. It creates a unique opportunity to unite geographically dispersed associates for face-to-face discussions regarding project challenges, opportunities, lessons learned, and best practices. The FM Training Forum also creates important networking opportunities and sharing of ideas across the region and among various property management roles, program areas, and regional support staff.</p>
<p><br />D. BACKGROUND <br />The FM Training Forum is aimed at property managers and many other GSA associates involved in property management programs. Past workshops have typically united 270 regional headquarters and field office employees involved in all aspects of the region's property management program for a series of lectures, interactive break-out sessions, sharing of lessons learned, best practices, and training sessions.</p>
<p>It is organized around a series of general sessions which begins each day and carries through a working lunch. In between the general sessions will be a series of break out and networking sessions, typically four per time slot, with six time slots throughout the conference.</p>
<p>The conference begins with a managers-only meeting from about 11 am to 5 pm on day one. On day 2 it continues with more managers' meetings from 8-11 am before starting the full forum with a lunch at 11am and kickoff presentation at 12:30 pm, followed by general sessions and breakouts until 5:30 pm and concluding with an awards dinner from 6 - 10 pm. The forum concludes on day three from 8 am - 2 pm. (closing lunch and activities from around noon until 2 pm).</p>
<p>E. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />In order to meet GSA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The Ballroom space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the Training Forum; therefore, the space should be visually appealing and provide a sense of grandeur and class. All program space must be blocked for the sole use of GSA for the duration of our conference. Spaces shall be contemporary, clean, well-ventilated, adequately soundproofed and handicapped accessible.</p>
<p>Because networking is a primary function of this Training Forum, seating and other furnishings in all public and guestroom areas of the hotel must be contemporary, attractive, or recently renovated.</p>
<p>GSA reserves the right to view and approve AV equipment during site visits. Equipment should be in excellent operating condition. AV prices should be submitted with the proposal and will be considered prior to award.</p>
<p>Guestrooms will be individually occupied. All must have flat screen TVs and be contemporary, handicapped accessible, and able to offer refrigerators upon request.</p>
<p>Food and beverage service must meet Federal Government's per diem rates. Presentation of food should be visually appealing, colorful, and offer a good variety of nutritional value and selection at each meal and snack.</p>
<p>In keeping with GSA's goal to be environmentally-friendly in all we do, the hotel selected should have an environmental program in place. The environmental program should be available for GSA to review upon request.</p>
<p>Fast and easy check-in and check-out capabilities are required. With 200 Training Forum attendees arriving at the property at one time, hotel must have a plan/staff to have check-in/check-out move quickly and efficiently. Luggage storage is required if guestrooms are not available for early check-in (11:00 AM arrival). Express check-out via guestroom TV or under guestroom door invoicing is required. Business Center with free boarding pass printing and a fully-functioning, clean, well-lit Fitness Center is a high preference.</p>
<p>The hotels considered must also meet the following event specifications and criteria:</p>
<p>1. Hotels located in Cook County are EXCLUDED, due to travel policies. <br />2. Hotel must be located in Lake or Dupage County within 30 miles proximity of O'Hare Airport. <br />3.

General areas (lobby, elevators, restrooms, etc.) should be modern, well maintained, spacious and well-lit.<br />5. An onsite restaurant is preferred.<br />6. The hotel must have accessibility primarily via major highways and thoroughfares. <br />7. The hotel must be able to accommodate both meeting and lodging needs in the same building.<br />8. Hotel must be able to provide a large open space conducive to social networking. <br />9. Single occupancy rate shall be within or below prevailing Federal Government per diem (currently $166/night in Lake Co., $92/night in DuPage Co.) <br />10. The hotel must be located in safe, accessible, well-lighted area.<br />11. Room rate must be offered three (3) days pre and post the proposed conference dates:</p>
<p>Tuesday, June 7: 15 rooms<br />Wednesday, June 8: 200 rooms</p>
<p>12. Reservations will be made through a group rooming list, to be provided 3 weeks prior to conference start (however, individuals will pay their own lodging).<br />13. Individual sleeping rooms should be equipped with telephone data ports. <br />14. No additional charge for double occupancy (i.e., spouses).<br />15. Four (4) Suite upgrades at the group rate.<br />16. Staff rooms at discounted rate are preferred.<br />17. Onsite free parking.<br />18. Providing some rooms with balconies or patios would be most ideal.<br />19. Free Internet for GSA attendees is highly preferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>F. GENERAL SESSION AND BREAK-OUT SESSION, AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION AND ROOM SET-UP REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />1.

<p>COMMANDANT CG-9121(WS)<br />U.S. COAST GUARD <br />2100 2ND Street, SW STOP 7112 <br />Washington, DC 20593-7112<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /><br />AMENDMENT I: THE SOLICITATION IS HEREBY AMENDED TO CORRECT AN ERROR IN THE "QUOTE PRICING SHEET". THE QUANTITY REQUESTED FOR QUOTATION OF "4" IS HEREBY REPLACED WITH "3". THIS CHANGE IS REFLECTED IN THE ATTACHED "REVISED QUOTE PRICING SHEET".&nbsp; VENDORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE REVISED QUOTE PRICING SHEET.&nbsp; ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.</p>

<p>Description:</p>
<p>The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) under Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the State of Mississippi Department of Public Safety (MDPS), pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. MDPS is uniquely qualified to provide the required data/services sought as it has sole control over the information contained within the Mississippi DMV database, the ability to change/correct such information, and up-to-date information from the database, which changes daily.</p>
<p>USCIS has a requirement to link Mississippi State DMV administration records to USCIS's Verification Information System (VIS). Currently the Verification Division (VER) is seeking to acquire access to Mississippi DMV information, customer service assistance, and program management services in order to implement an enhancement to the E-Verify System.

<DESC>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR PACKING, CONTAINERIZATION ANIJ<br>LOCAL DRAYAGE OF DIRECT PROCUREMENT METHOD (DPM) PERSONAL<br>PROPERTY SHIPMENTS<br><br>PART I DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES<br><br>A.	SCOPE OF WORK<br><br>The contractor will furnish all personnel, equipment, facilities, supplies, services and materials,<br>except as specified herein as government-furnished, for the preparation of personal property of<br>Department of Defense (DOD) personnel for shipment and/or storage and related services through the DPM. Work to be performed will be those services in the Schedules awarded to the contractor as outlined in individual Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) items. Tasks by type of move are reflected in Table G-I. Task/Type of Move Matrix, showing which tasks normally apply to each type of move. Specific requirements for each task are described below. If specific instructions or requirements are not provided, commercial standards of services and best business practices are acceptable.<br><br>1.	 PREMOVE SURVEY. The contractor will determine the nature of personal property offered for shipment either by physical inspection or telephone survey with the member/employee. The survey will be conducted at a time and date mutually agreed upon between the contractor and the member/employee. Any pack/pickup date changes will be coordinated with the ordering officer.<br><br>2.   WEIGHING.<br><br>a.    The gross, tare, and net weight of all shipments will be determined through the use of scales properly certified by a state inspector of weights and measures In Accordance With (TAW) the regulations of the state or district having legal jurisdiction over the scales. Personnel designated to operate the scales will be licensed or otherwise qualified as weigh masters if required by the state, commonwealth, or district. When a metric scale is utilized, the contractor will use I kilogram per 2.2 pounds for conversion.<br><br> b.    The contractor will submit weight tickets, reflecting gross, tare, and net weight, in duplicate, properly certified TAW federal, state, and commonwealth or district regulations to the ordering officer with documentation (Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) 0002).<br><br>c. When scales are not available or their use is not practical, the application of a constructive weight of seven pounds per cubic foot will be used provided prior written approval is obtained from the ordering officer. (See Paragraph (Para) A.2.d for constructive weight of Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E), (also known as PRO or PRO-Gear).<br><br><br>d. When PBP&E are included as part of the shipment, the weight of each item individually described on the inventory will be entered on the same line of the inventory next to the description. The total weight of such articles will be annotated separately on the inventory and packing list. The PBP&E weight may be obtained using bathroom or platform type scales. If it is not possible or practical for the contractor to weigh the items at the time of packing and pick p, and there is no cube indicated on the inventory, a constructive weight of 40 pounds per cubic foot will be used for PBP&E.<br><br>e. The weight tickets will contain the name and address of the weighing station, the date, name of contractor, van or trailer number, name of member/employee, call number assigned by the ordering officer, and signature of the weigh master.<br><br>f. For inbound personal property, the contractor will bill on the origin net weights obtained from the Personal Property Government Bill of Lading/Bill of Lading (PPGBL/BL) or other movement document and need not submit a weight certificate, unless a reweigh is ordered.  When a reweigh is ordered, the contractor will bill on the reweigh weight.<br><br>g. If the PPGBL/BL, movement document, or container does not reflect the net weight for inbound shipments or if the PPGBL/BL is unavailable at the destination, the contractor will bill on the origin gross weights obtained from the PPGBL/BL, or other available sources, such as containers or supporting documentation. The contractor is required to use all means available (containers, supporting documentation) to obtain a net weight prior to submitting the bill. If the bill is submitted on the origin gross weight, the contractor is paid for the gross weight based on the net weight bid price.<br><br>h. The contractor will perform reweigh services when ordered. The reweigh will normally<br>be requested at the time the delivery order is placed and will be performed TAW<br>instructions set forth in Para A.2.a. When so advised by the ordering officer, a<br>designated representative of the ordering officer or the member/employee will be permitted to accompany, in a separate conveyance, the contractor to witness the reweigh. This would be at no extra charge and the contractor would not provide the separate conveyance.<br><br>i. When a reweigh is ordered, the contractor will furnish the ordering officer weight tickets in duplicate within seven workdays of completion of the service.<br><br>j. When the weighing of a shipment at origin is witnessed by the Personal Property Shipping Office (PPSO), the back of all copies of the weight ticket will be annotated with the statement "weight observed" and verified by the signature of the PPSO. The number 7 copy of the PPGBLIBL (property received copy) will be similarly annotated prior to mailing to the destination PPSo. When computer generated PPGBLIBLs are used, the copy going to the destination PPSO will be annotated.<br><br>k. Billing Procedures. For Continental United States (CONUS) activities, to include Hawaii and Alaska, shipments are payable on the basis of 100-pound minimum weight for Unaccompanied Baggage (UB) and a 500-pound minimum weight for Household Goods (HHG), net or gross weight, as indicated in the bid item. For overseas activities, excluding Hawaii and Alaska, shipments are payable on the actual net weight shipped.<br><br>l. Actual pieces, weight, and cube of UB shipments will be provided to the Transportation Office (TO)/PPSO prior to the issuance of the PPGBL/BL.<br><br>3. TIME REQUIREMENTS.<br><br>    a. The ordering officer will normally give the contractor notice to commence services ordered<br>   herein at least one full workday prior to the date specified. Oral orders will be confirmed in<br>   writing within two workdays following order acceptance by the contractor. The contractor<br>   will be available to receive orders between the hours 0800 and 1700. Upon request, the<br>   contractor will provide information as to whether the service will be performed between the<br>   hours of 0800 to 1200 hours or between the hours of 1200 to 1700 hours, based upon the best<br>   information available.<br><br>   b. In unusual situations, it may be necessary for the ordering officer to direct performance of<br>services at specified times or days. When services are ordered for other than normal duty<br>days and hours, then overtime charges are applicable under Attachment G3, Schedule I, Item<br>0014, Additional Services.<br><br>  c. The contractor will not begin pick-up or delivery services at a member/employee's residence<br>before 0800 hours or after 1700 hours without prior approval of the ordering officer and the<br>member/employee. The contractor will not begin any service that will not allow completion<br>by 2100 hours without approval by the ordering officer and the member/employee by 1630<br>hours of the scheduled date. When services cannot be completed on the scheduled date, the<br>contractor will notify the ordering officer and the member/employee. In case of an approved<br>suspension of operations, the contractor will assure his/her return the next workday at 0800<br>hours to complete the services.<br><br>  d. If containerization is ordered at the contractor's facility, the HHG or UB will be picked up on<br>the date and within the hours specified. Unless a longer period is authorized by the ordering<br>office, the maximum containerization time allowed at the contractor's facility will be three<br>workdays following the specified pickup date for BEG and two workdays following the<br>specified pickup date for UB.<br><br>  e. The contractor will accept from commercial carriers and pickup from commercial, air, water,<br>and military terminals inbound shipments of HHG or UB. The contractor will notify the<br>ordering officer upon arrival of a shipment but not later than 1200 hours of the next workday.<br>Delivery will be affected within three workdays following the date of the contractor's arrival<br>notification unless otherwise specified. For shipments in storage, the contractor will affect<br>delivery to the residence within three workdays following notification for delivery by the<br>ordering officer (e.g., ordering officer calls on Monday, personal property will be delivered<br>on or before Thursday). The contractor will not deviate from the specified delivery date<br>unless approved by the ordering officer.<br><br>4. PREPARATION. PACKING.  LOADING.  AND CONTAINERIZATION.<br><br>a. Personal property will be prepared, packed, loaded, and containerized for all types of<br>shipments destined for the CONUS or Outside CONUS (OCONUS). It is the contractor's<br>responsibility to coordinate with the ordering officer container size and configuration for each mode of shipment prior to packing containers.<br><br>b. The contractor will perform all preparation and packing in a manner requiring the least cubic measurement, producing packages that withstand normal movement without damage to the container or contents and at a minimum of weight. All shipments will be protected from the elements (rain, snow or sun) and theft at all times.<br><br>(1) Items of unusual nature may require disassembly service by a third party. The<br>contractor will not arrange for third party servicing without the authorization of the ordering officer. The charges for third party service will be billed by the contractor as separate charge on the invoice and supported with two copies of the third party Company's invoice. Examples of such items are: Shrunks, wall units, grandfather clocks, and grand pianos.<br><br>(2) The contractor will not be required to disassemble swing sets, outdoor recreation equipment, television and radio antennas, and similar articles. The member/employee will disassemble these items. Items disassembled by the member/employee will be shown in the remarks section of the inventory as Disassembled by the Owner (DBO).<br><br>(3) Member/Employee Packed Items. Items already packed by the member/employee will be inspected and repacked by the contractor, with the exception of Attachment G3, Schedule I, Item 0006, Outbound Service Unaccompanied Baggage Packed by Member/Employee and Item 0007, Outbound Service-Unaccompanied Baggage Packed By Member/Employee-Consolidated Shipments/Government Facility. The carrier assumes liability for whatever they pack. The carrier has the right to inspect all items and will use the appropriate carton(s) to pack all items (i.e., clothes in wardrobe boxes) thereby affording items the proper protection. PPSOs will ensure that items are shipped in sealed cartons for stacking in trucks/crates and to avoid pilferage.<br>Therefore, one of two things must occur:<br><br>(a) Let the carrier pack all contents in cartons and then stack empty plastic totes or tubs separately for onward movement, or<br><br>(b) Let the member/employee provide an already-packed tote/tub. The carrier will then inspect and decide the following:<br><br>1 Empty the tote/tub and place its contents in a carton, or<br><br>2 Ship the tote/tub as is with contents. It will be the carrier's responsibility to place the tote/tub in a proper carton or container for safe movement. Tape may not be placed directly on the tote/tub.<br><br>(c) The above decision is at the carrier's discretion. Members/employees cannot insist that the contents must remain in the tote/tub since the carrier assumes liability for the tote/tub and the contents.<br><br>(4) Trunks and Footlockers. Trunks and footlockers may contain a properly packed quantity of HHG that is reasonable for the construction and condition of the container.<br><br>c. When the ordering officer authorizes tailgating, the load will not extend beyond the surface of the tailgate or beyond the surface of the vehicle. The tailgated items will be protected from inclement weather by a suitable covering.<br><br>d. Containerization. Containerization of outbound HHG and UB will be done at the member's/employee's residence, unless otherwise authorized by the ordering officer. The contractor will perform all exterior containerization services as prescribed in Paragraph A.7 for the type of articles, destination, and method of shipment designated by the ordering officer.<br><br>(I) FIREARMS. When firearms are included in containerized shipments, they will be placed<br>in the number one container in such a manner to permit easy withdrawal for inspection.<br>Make, model, caliber or gauge, and serial number of the firearm will be listed on the<br>inventory form (See Paragraph A.5.c.)<br><br>(2) BOATS. Boats may include, but are not limited to, the following: canoes, skiffs, light<br>rowboats, kayaks, and sailboats. The contractor will be required to accept a boat and/or<br>boat trailer less than 14 feet in length or over 14 feet in length (member only) but less<br>than 500 pounds in weight from a member/employee. Employees are limited to<br>domestic shipment of boats and their associated trailer that can be transported in a<br>moving van (e.g., canoe, kayak, rowboat, outboard/inboard motorboat [14 ft or<br>less*. Components and boat accessories that will not fit into an American Society for<br>Testing and Materials, (ASTM) D4I690 1. Standard Practice for Performance Testing of<br>Shipping Containers and Systems or Military Surface Deployment and Distribution<br>Command (SDDC) Pamphlet 55.12, Commercial Containers for Department of Defense<br>Household Goods Shipments. Container will be containerized LA W ASTM<br>D625I /D6251 MO 1. Standard Specification for Wood Cleated Panelboard Shipping<br>Boxes. The member/employee will be responsible for any special crating or materials<br>needed to move the boat by DPM.<br><br>e. Security Seals. All exterior HHG/UB containers and boxes, including overflow and oversize<br>boxes and rug tubes/cartons, will be sealed with accountable seals at the member's/employee's residence, unless otherwise authorized by the ordering officer. Sealing will be completed prior to any movement and the seal (control) numbers entered on the inventory, cross-referencing the container number. Two seals, as a minimum, for UB, will be used per box and seals will secure the access overlap top and ends. If only two seals out of a set of four are used, the seals not used will be destroyed at the time of sealing or given to the member/employee. Four seals, as a minimum, on HHG, will be used per box and seals will secure the access overlap door and side panels.<br><br>f. Removal of Debris. Packing and loading at the origin will include, as a minimum, removing<br>from the member's/employee's residence all empty contractor-provided containers, packing<br>materials, and other debris accumulated incident to packing and loading unless specifically<br>waived by the member/employee in writing.<br><br>5. TAGGING INVENTORYING. AND PACKING LIST. The contractor, in coordination with the member/employee, will prepare an accurate, legible, HHG/UB descriptive inventory similar to Figure G 1-1. Household Goods Descriptive Inventory. The contractor will count and examine all goods tendered for shipments, receipt for them, and make written exception for any goods not in apparent good order. All tagging will be accomplished prior to the removal of goods from the<br>residence.<br><br>a. Inventory Identification. Each carton will be marked to indicate the general contents and member's/employee's last name. Each carton will be tagged and inventoried as a separate inventory tine item. Identify the cartons by type and cube with an indication of general contents, such as, linens, pots and pans, mirror carton, 3.5 cubic feet.<br><br>b. Inventory Symbols. The "Exception Symbols" and "Location Symbols," as shown in Figure 01-1, will be used to describe locations and exceptions. Locations and exceptions will be true and accurate. The omission of exception symbols will indicate good condition except for normal wear. Describe in as much detail as possible items of furniture; for example, television sets will be identified as being either "color" (C) or "black and white" (B&W) and console or portable. The contractor will annotate on the inventory item(s) such as TVs, stereo components, computer hardware, VCRs, video cameras, by make, model, and serial number when these are visible on the outside of the item.<br><br>c. Each privately owned firearm will be annotated on the inventory by make, model, caliber or gauge, and serial number.<br><br>d. For PBP&E, ensure that the term "PRO-GEAR (PRO)" is used to identify such articles on the inventory, together with the cube and weight of the individual carton; a line entry item for each container, such as, carton PRO 3 cubic ft., 53 lbs. These items identified by the member/employee will be separated from other items of the shipment, weighed separately, and placed in separate boxes or cartons to provide safe transportation. The symbol PRO will be used. The total weight of the packed professional items will be recorded on the last page of the inventory and on the packing list for outbound HHG and UB shipments.<br><br>(I) For employees, PBP&E includes an employee's personally owned professional or specialized items and other materials used for official duty performance. PBP&E does not include sports equipment; office, household, or shop fixtures; or furniture (e.g., bookcases, file cabinets, desks, and racks of any kind). PBP&E are HHG. If the PBP&E may cause an excess weight condition, PBP&E may be moved as an administrative expense, (see the Joint Travel Regulations, Para C3154, Basic Allowances) as opposed to a HHG transportation expense, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>(a) The employee will furnish an itemized inventory of PBP&E for review by an official designated by the authorizing/order-issuing command, at the new Permanent Duty Station (PDS);<br><br>(b) The employee will furnish evidence (as determined by the authorizing/order-issuing command) that transporting the itemized materials as part of the HHG results in a weight in excess of the maximum weight allowance; and<br><br>( c) An official designated by the authorizing/order-issuing command at the new PDS, will review and certify that the itemized PBP&E, are necessary for the proper performance of the employee's duties at the new PDS, and that if these items are not transported to the new PDS, the same or similar items would have to be obtained (at government expense) for the employee's use at the new PDS.<br><br>e. Items disassembled by the contractor will be shown in the remarks section of the inventory as Contractor Disassembled (CD). Items disassembled by the member/employee will be shown in the remarks section of the inventory as DBO. When an article is packed in an original container furnished by the member/employee, the inventory will indicate the type of article and will be shown as Contractor Packed (CP).<br><br>f. Motorcycles, mopeds, and motor scooters will be inventoried as one line item, listing their serial number, make, year, model, and odometer reading. For international shipments, ensure one copy of the title and/or registration is attached to all copies of the<br>PPGBL/BL Commercial Bill of Lading/Transportation Control and Movement Document (TCMD).<br><br>NOTE: Motorcycles and mopeds that do not conform to vehicle emissions standards and<br>motor vehicle safety standards of the destination country cannot be shipped as part of a HHG shipment.<br><br>g. When the ordering officer permits the contractor to partially containerize a shipment at the warehouse, each item removed from the residence will be annotated on the inventory as Containerized Warehouse (CW).<br><br>h. Inventory Form. The inventory form will bear the signature of the member/employee, and date signed, together with the signature of the contractor's representative and date signed certifying to its accuracy and completeness.<br>i. The contractor will prepare the inventory in five copies for outbound HHG and UB shipments and in three copies for local drayage moves. The original and all copies will be legible and will bear the name and complete mailing address of the contractor. The original inventory will be furnished to the ordering officer, the contractor will retain one copy, and one copy will be given to the member/employee (CDRL 0003, Household Goods Descriptive Inventory). For HHG and UB, the contractor will place in a waterproof envelope secured to the No. I container: one copy of the inventory; one copy of the DD Form 1299, Application for the Shipment and/or Storage of Personal Property (Figure 401-1), and if an overseas shipment, one copy of the member's/employee's orders and custom's document. Additionally, for HHG, the contractor will place an envelope containing the following documents in an easily accessible location inside the No.1 container: one copy of the packing list and Exception Sheet for shipments released from Nontemporary Storage (NTS). For unaccompanied baggage shipments, the contractor will place one copy of the member's/employee's orders inside the carton prior to sealing. The member/employee will be required to furnish all necessary copies of their order.<br><br>j. Annotate the receiving document or inventory to show any overage, shortage, and damage found, including visible damage to external shipping containers and condition of security seals each time custody of the property changes from a storage contractor (warehouseman) to the contractor or from one contractor or carrier to another. When available, use the same inventory prepared at origin to verify delivery and condition of the articles at destination.<br><br>k. Packing Lists. The packing list identified in Figure G 1-2, Packing List of Household Goods. or a similar format, will be used. The contracting officer will advise the contractor as to the required packing list prior to the start date of the contract. The contractor will prepare a packing list at the time the goods are packed, noting the number of each piece, the weight, and the cubic measurement.<br><br>l. Removal from NTS. When the personal property is to be removed from NTS, the contractor will obtain from the storage contractor two legible copies of the NTS inventory and in conjunction with the storage contractor, check each item of the storage lot JAW such inventory. If at the time each item is checked there is a difference in condition of the item from that listed on the NTS inventory, the contractor will prepare an Exception Sheet and such differing conditions will be noted thereon. When the contractor elects to make a new inventory, differences as to condition of individual items, as compared with the NTS inventory, will be shown on an Exception Sheet as described above. In the event the opinions of the contractor's representative and storage contractor's representative differ as to shortages and overages or condition of an item(s), both opinions will be listed on the Exception Sheet and separately identified as to the source. Both parties will sign and date the Exception Sheet, each retaining a legible copy for their respective files (CDRL 0004, Exception Sheet). Such an Exception Sheet will remain an internal industry document. In the event a claim is filed, the contractor will provide legible copies of the Exception Sheet to the claims officer.<br><br>(1) Preparation of Inventories. Inventories prepared on shipments released from NTS will indicate the same article identification and item number as on the NTS inventory or a cross-reference will be made on the new inventory indicating the item number and identification from the NTS inventory. The use of legible photo reproductions of the storage contractor's inventory in lieu of preparing a new inventory is permissible.<br><br>(2) Identify personal property by affixing a tag or tape to each article (not applicable to individual items in packing containers). Each shipment will be separately identified by lot number. Each article will be assigned a number that will correspond with the item number shown on the inventory form. The type of identification used and the method of affixing it to the article will be such as not to damage any article so identified.<br><br>(3) Identify items disassembled or serviced by contractor or by third party at origin and record such items in the remarks section of the inventory.<br><br>6. APPLIANCE SERVICING AND UNSERVICING. The contractor will service and un service<br>appliances TAW manufacturer's specifications. If third party servicing or unservicing is<br>required and approved by the ordering officer, the contractor will bill the services as prescribed<br>in Paragraph A.4.b.(1).<br><br>7. CONTAINERS AND VEHICLES<br><br>a. Government-Owned Containers (GOCs). GOCs are containers constructed lAW Commercial Standard ASTM-D4169-01, Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Shipping Containers and Systems. GOCs also include those containers listed in SDDC Pamphlet 5512, those meeting ASTM-D6251, and wooden overflow and oversize containers purchased by the government or received by the contractor awarded the Schedule II, Inbound Services contract. GOCs will be used to the extent as they are available for Schedule l Items 0001 through 0005, before using contractor-furnished containers.<br><br>(1) All GOCs and contractor-furnished containers will be free of defects (holes, loose or broken framing, missing skids, caulking repairs, or separated plywood). Unacceptable containers are those that have been extended to accommodate oversize or overflow items, any panel bowed or bulging beyond their normal conformity, those with deteriorated plywood (either rotted or delaminated), those caulked on outside seams or joints, and those patched without the use of caulking compound. Patches on the outside surfaces are not acceptable because they increase the overall dimension and are subject to being scraped off during handling. The floor will be solid and all skids installed and<br>in sound condition.<br><br>(2) All GOCs and contractor furnished containers must conform to USDA requirements for Wood Packaging Materials (WPM). WPM is defined as wood pallets, skids, load boards, pallet collars, wooden boxes, reels, dunnage, crates, frames, and cleats. Packaging materials exempt from the requirements are materials that have undergone a manufacturing process such as corrugated fiberboard, plywood, particleboard, veneer and oriented strand board. All WPM must be constructed from Heat Treated (HT) lumber (HT to 56 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes) and certified by an accredited agency recognized by the American Lumber Standards Committee (ALSC), Incorporated or an equivalent organization recognized by the host nation's government for WPM procured outside the United States (US) TAW WPM policy and WPM enforcement regulations CIittp://www.alsc.org). Wood fumigated with methyl bromide is<br>not authorized for use in the shipment of HHGs as damage may occur to the HHGs. All materials must include certification markings TAW ALSC standards and be placed in an unobstructed area that will be readily visible to inspectors. Pallet markings will be applied to the stringer or block on diagonally opposite sides and ends of the pallet and be contrasting and clearly visible.

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and incorporates provisions and clauses as those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition and is available upon request by e-mail only at Les.Lecceardone@va.gov.  The North American Classification System Code (NAICS) is 622210 with a $34.5M size standard.  The NCA plans to purchase Consulting services that includes: (1) the development of a Veterans Health Administration (VA) version of the Preventing Addiction Related Suicide (PARS-VA) module, a secondary suicide prevention program that targets high-risk Veterans receiving group-based outpatient VA addiction treatment; (2) the revision of  the PARS-VA so that it is acceptable, feasible, and applicable to include in VA-based Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) addiction treatment.  Iterative versions or Beta drafts of the PARS-VA will be developed from multiple sources (e.g., evidence-based literature) and through input from stakeholders including VA addiction patients, counselors, administrators, as well as civilian consultants with expertise in addiction and suicide prevention; and (3) to pilot test and examine the effect of the PARS-VA on addiction patient and addiction counselor outcomes including knowledge regarding issues such as suicide prevention and addiction, attitudes toward suicide, suicide prevention, and addiction, and behavior should issues of suicide emerge in oneself or others (e.g., calling a crisis line).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes and no response to this announcement is necessary.  Questions may be directed to Les Lecceardone, Contracting Specialist at Les.Lecceardone@va.gov .
