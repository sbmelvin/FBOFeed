<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with 
New Jersey officials, requires a firm, fixed-priced, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennnis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey. This spring APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total dbh of 1,774 via Mauget trunk injection. Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees. ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal to or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore. This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified. Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by May 30, 2003.  .   
A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional applications are needed beyond May 30th or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the Fall of 2003.  . The effective period of the contract will be from approximately May 1, 2003, or date of award, through September 30, 2003, with unilateral options to extend the effective period of the contract on a month-by-month basis for a period not to exceed an additional 6 months.  The solicitation will be issued as a request for proposals (RFP) and will be released on or about March 17, 2003. Offers are due to the Contracting Officer by 11:00 A.M. Central Time, Tuesday, April 8, 2003, or as indicated on the RFP, whichever is later.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs, and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code: 115310.  Size Standard: $6.0 million dollar average annual receipts. The RFP may be downloaded off the Internet after March 17, 2003, or within 2 days after the issuance of the RFP, from the following Internet site: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html  TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR A COPY OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation (RFP 101-17-03) for commerci= al items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; responses reflecting availability of the service as described are requested in the form of a proposal.  A separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-12.  The NAICS Classification code is 561110 the size limited is 6 million.  It is a set-aside for small businesses.  The value range of this requirement is 50,000 =96 100,000 dollars. The objective of this project will be to create a Master Program Schedule for the CARES initiative using critical-path-methodology (CPM).  Once the initial baseline schedule is prepared, Contractor will update progress to date and address changes to the critical path on a weekly basis for the next 6 months. Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has initiated the CARES project for the purpose of realigning their capital infrastructure to provide the optimal level of care to a projected target date of 2022. VA facilities across the country will be grouped into markets and each market will have to develop a market plan to address the above stated purpose. To facilitate this process VA desires to develop a master program schedule to coordinate the workload of various internal task assignments and independent contracts. We require a critical-path-methodology (CPM) that will highlight the critical path activities at the program level with drill-down capabilities. Methodology: Contractor will take all existing schedules from current CARES contracts and VA staff responsible for deliverables and integrate into a Master Program Schedule applying predecessor and successor logic at key integrated points or Milestones that will allow the project team and management to monitor critical path at the macro (Program) and micro (Project/Contractor) levels.  Activity coding requirements are data parameters that allow for various forms of sorting operations, data analysis and organization of work.  Examples of activity coding requirements include responsibility, area (location), type of work, and work-breakdown-structure.  Additionally, contractor will assign (labor hours or other resources) activities to project resource requirements and or cost load activities to determine costing requirements for the project.  Schedules will be prepared for work relating to each contractor and responsible VA office.  Requirements: Contractor will use a scheduling tool as Project Management (PPM) method to accomplish this task.  MS Project, along with PPM method, has the functionality to develop and track the data parameters, CPM, and resource/cost-loading requirements needed for this project. The preferred tool is Primavera. Contractor will produce the integrated Master Program Schedule in the first week and then an updated Master Program Schedule each week over the next 25 weeks. Weekly documents will be placed on CARES WEB-Site and up-dated each week by Contractor. Additional information is available and will be provided via e-mail upon request.

<DESC>NA Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) sole source contract using FAR Part 15 to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)  of McLean, VA.  Cost-Plus-Award-Fee, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee and Firm Fixed Price Task Orders will be issued against the basic IDIQ contract for continued Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) for services necessary to support the Cooperative Th reat Reduction (CT) Directorate for a base period of 12 months with a six-month option period. The contract will also include language to allow either the base period to exceed the ordering period by an additional six months or if the option period is exer cised then allow the option period to exceed the ordering period by an additional four months for a potential total of 22 months of performance.  It is anticipated that the contract and task order(s) will be effective on or about July 2003.  This sole sour ce contract is necessary to insure continued SETA support to the CT Directorate until the execution of a contract under a follow-on competition.  It is anticipated that in June 2003 a synopsis announcing the issuance of a draft RFP for the follow-on compet ition for SETA support to the CT Directorate will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).  The Government's minimum requirements for the SETA support for this sole source fall into six major technical areas available on an integrat ed basis from one contractor: (1) Operational Support, (2) Logistics Support, (3) Technical Support, (4) Financial Management Support, (5) Program Management Support, and (6) Information System Support.  The functions to be supported include, but are not l imited to, the review of requirements and schedules; planning, coordination and evaluating task performance; participating with CT Directorate personnel in interactions with other contractors, other Executive Branch departments and agencies, and government s of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and other countries as the CT mission dictates. The contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, materials and equipment required to provide professional SETA services necessary to support the CT Directorate and all of its associated mission areas.  The CT effort is large, complex and highly visible effort to prevent the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and related technologies and expertise from other countries.  This includes providing for the safe  destruction of Soviet era WMD and WMD in other countries as the CT mission dictates, associated delivery systems and related infrastructure.   Therefore, it requires an experienced, technically astute, innovative and flexible management structure, which c an respond to rapidly shifting priorities and requirements and anticipate problems long before they arise.  To facilitate access to contractor expertise by CT personnel, the contractor shall maintain an appropriate technical staff at a single location that  is no more than 20 minutes by car in a non-rush hour setting from DTRA Headquarters at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested parties have five business days from the date of publication of this Synopsis, to submit in writing, to the identified point of contact, clear and convincing evidence of their qualifications and/ or capabilities.  Such qualifications and/or capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after five days, or without the required information, will b e considered non-responsive to this synopsis and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government to not conduct this effort as a full-and-open competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the G overnment.  All inquiries must be submitted  in writing to the address or facsimile number stated herein and to the attention of Ms. Cynthia Dean, Contract Specialist.  Responses to this notice must be received by close of business, 13 March 2003.  Responses must include your business name, point of  contact, address, and telephone number with area code.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Requests may be faxed to (703) 767-4691.  If no responses are received, an award will be made to Science Applications International Corporation.

<CONTACT>Thomas Howcroft, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-713-0838 x205, Fax (301) 713-0809, Email thomas.howcroft@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate with the Conference Board Inc on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source.   The Conference Board Inc creates and disseminates knowledge about management and the marketplace to help businesses strengthen their performance and better serve society.  Working as a global, independent membership organization in the public interest, they conduct research, convene conferences, make forecasts, assess trends, publish information and analysis, and bring executives together to learn from one another, convenes conferences, publishes information and analyses, makes forecasts, and assesses trends.  The Conference Board has a long history as a trusted "think-tank" for corporate America.  More than 3,000 companies and organizations in 67 nations are members of the Conference Board's global network.  The Conference Board is one of the best resources and is a trusted channel of communication to CEOs.  The Conference Board's strategic goal is to engage CEOs and other senior management using its resources in economics, corporate citizenship leadership, performance excellence and governance to address critical infrastructure issues surrounding the role of strategic management in the broader context of business management.  The relationship with the Conference Board will explore and communicate business security policy issues through non-partisan research, publications, and forums.  The Conference Board Inc is a not-for-profit organization and holds 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status in the United States.  It is anticipated that this requirement will be awarded for a base period and two option years.  

This requirement is being issued to provide program support for the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO), which was part of the Department of Commerce/ Bureau of Industry and Security, but transitioned on March 1, 2003 to the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IA&IP) Directorate in the Department of Homeland Security.  The CIAO, under Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), has the responsibility for coordinating a national awareness and outreach program on critical infrastructure protection, particularly information security, to the private sector.  To support this mission, the office works with private industry channels of communication and influence to reach strategic audiences within industry who can make policy, strategy and investment decisions within their own companies and industries to support the objectives of PDD-63.  The CIAO has the responsibility to establish a national outreach, education and awareness effort with the leadership of local government and industry representing major sectors for this effort.  The CIAO has identified the issue of public leadership as one that urgently needs to be addressed within State and Local Governments.

The purpose of this requirement is to allow the Department of Homeland to raise awareness on security (both in terms of cyber and physical protection) among corporate executives (e.g., CEOs, CFOs, COOs, CIOs, and other senior level management).  The challenge of a national awareness and outreach effort is to present a compelling business case for corporate action.  The primary focus of the CIAO's efforts will be to reach leaders in the critical infrastructure industries (i.e., food and agriculture, water, public health, emergency services, government, defense industrial base, information and telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking and finance, chemical and hazardous materials, and postal and shipping) and particularly corporate boards and chief executive officers who are ultimately responsible for setting company policy and allocating company resources.  The basic message is that critical infrastructure assurance is a matter of corporate governance and risk management.  Senior management is responsible for securing corporate assets, including information and information systems.  As part of their fiduciary duties, corporate boards are accountable for providing effective oversight of the development and implementation of appropriate infrastructure security policies and best practices.  The CIAO seeks to engender awareness within this key group and concentrate its efforts on the economic implications of securing vital assets, systems, and networks against deliberate physical and cyber attacks.

The tasks include:  (1) development of an in-depth research report on security awareness for corporate executives.  The goal of the research will be to provide a comprehensive cross-section of knowledge on corporate practices and trends in security awareness and business continuity issues;  (2) development of three Executive Action Reports that are designed to communicate key concepts to generate awareness of key themes and trends of potential interest and importance to senior business executives; and (3) development of  two (one-day) conferences to reach senior level executives.  The conferences will focus on the economic perspective of security and critical infrastructure assurance.  

Offerors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response with a demonstrating their expertise and a level of competency in the field.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 45-days after publication of this synopsis.  See note 22.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) Integrated Product Team (IPT) under the Area Attack Program Office, AAC/YH, plans to issue a competitive solicitation within 60 days to modify the TMD Fuze (currently in production) to a Government Performance Specification.  The plan is for replacement of a mechanical timer with an electronic timer in the fuze for the Tactical Munition Dispenser (TMD) section of the SFW system due to reliability issues.  This effort was previously synopsized in the FedBizOps as Solicitation Number YHK-03-0001; however, the acquisition strategy has changed.  An Industry Day will be conducted on Eglin AFB on 3 April 2003 in building 1, conference room 204.  Directions shall be available upon request.  This will be a 1-day event including a preliminary Government presentation in the morning, followed by separate 90-minute, one-on-one sessions with each interested contractor.  The purpose of this event will be to disseminate Government intentions and expectations to potential contractors participating in a competitive, best value acquisition for a modification to the SFW TMD fuze.  It is requested that each contractor limit the number of Industry Day participants to no more than 5 individuals.  Accordingly, please submit your visitor request forms no later than 3 working days prior to commencement of Industry Day.  For contractual questions including submission of visitor requests and scheduling one-on-one sessions, please contact Lt Anita Skipper at anita.skipper@eglin.af.mil or call (850) 882-3416 ext. 3259.  The TMD fuze is currently manufactured in accordance with a Government Owned Technical Data Package by Alliant TechSystems, Janesville, WI, under contract to Textron Systems, Wilmington, MA, the SFW contractor.  In this competitive acquisition, the contractor must produce a modified fuze to be qualified and tested.  The modified fuze must be physically and functionally interchangeable with the current production fuze.  This project is considered to be medium to high risk based on safety of flight and integration with existing components.  The modified fuze must meet the safety requirements contained in MIL-STD-1316E and be approved by the Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB).  The initial effort includes non-recurring production engineering required to modify the current fuze design to current electronic technology and produce and qualify the hardware.  Options will be included for production quantities.  The estimated contract cost for this initial effort is $2.1M with $35M in options through fiscal year 2012.  A firm fixed-price type contract is contemplated.  An export controlled Technical Data Package is available upon request and Government receipt of a DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement.  The DD Form 2345 is for export control certification from the Defense Logistics Center (DLSC), Battle Creek MI 49016-3412 (1-800-352-3572) in accordance with DODD 5230.25.  This is not a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid.  Additionally, it is not the Government’s intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.   No collect calls, or telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted.  Direct all requests for solicitation and routine communications concerning this acquisition to Lt Anita Skipper (850) 882-3416, extension 3259.

This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

2. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

3. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), has a requirement for a Communication Relay Payload (CRP) System that can be integrated into a Dragon Eye (DE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) System. The DE CRP is intended to provide a relay to a separate DE air vehicle that is extended beyond the normal line of sight (LOS) range. The basic requirements to fulfill this effort as described in the Statement of Work (SOW) are as follows. The contractor shall provide one (1) CRP System to be integrated into the DE UAV System that meets the following requirements. (a) The electronics for the CRP shall “fit” into the existing DE nose and weigh as close to one (1) pound as possible. (b) There shall be no Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) issues between the CRP system and all existing UAV electronics on board. All cables should be shielded. (c) The CRP shall interface with existing DE UAV communication links – uplink and downlink (e.g., power, frequencies). (d) The CRP shall operate in the following temperature range requirements:  -20 degrees Fahrenheit to +120 degrees Fahrenheit. (e) The electronics for the CRP shall draw power from the existing connector in the DE UAV nose. The connector provides 12 volts to the nose from the primary flight battery. (f) The electronics for the CRP shall be packaged in the DE UAV nose in a manner that will withstand a 20G shock load  (Requirement to protect the sensor as much as possible exists in order to reuse sensor if outer shell of nose is damaged). (g) The CRP shall operate in a light rain.  Conformal coating of circuit boards should be implemented as required.  The contractor shall describe additional options for implementation in light rain. (h) The electronics for the CRP shall be integrated without introducing changes to the bottom of the nose (due to dirt and debris intake).  If modifications to the nose are required, changes can be made to the sides or the top of the nose as long as they do not interfere with the aerodynamics of the air vehicle or the air data sensors. (i) The Center of Gravity (CG) of the aircraft shall be maintained upon integration of the electronics into the DE UAV nose. (j) The CRP system shall provide a minimum of four selectable non-interfering channels for both uplink and downlink. Downlink frequencies shall reside in 1710 – 1850 Megahertz (MHz) band, and uplink frequencies shall reside in 335.4 – 399.9 MHz band. The four specific frequencies shall be provided after contract award. Responses should be mailed to the following address: COMMANDER, Marine Corps Systems Command, Code CTQ6LF, 2033 Barnett Avenue Suite 315, Quantico, Virginia, 22134-5010. Email responses should be sent to frazierly@mcsc.usmc.mil.  The hand carry/courier address is: COMMANDER, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attention: Lynn Y. Frazier, Code CTQ6LF, 3041A McCawley Ave, Quantico, VA 22134. Responses shall be submitted not later than 14 Apr 2003.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209), intends to award a modification to sole-source firm-fixed price contract N00019-03-C-6554 with Honeywell, Defense Avionics Systems, 9201 San Mateo Blvd, Albuquerque, NM for one additional year of full rate production and support of the Advanced Multi-Purpose Color Display (AMPCD) system.  The AMPCD replaces the legacy Multi-Purpose Color Display (MPCD) in the F/A-18C/D and AV-8B.  Military aircraft continue to require a replacement display to remain mission capable as the legacy display becomes unsupportable in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003.  The AMPCD shall comply with the approved Performance Specification for Advanced Mission Computer and Displays (AMC&D) Advanced Multi-Purpose Color Display (AMPCD), Interface Control Document(s), and Full Rate Production Statement of Work for AMPCD.  The modification will extend the contract for one year, providing for the procurement of AMPCD systems for use on the F/A-18C/D and AV-8B with interim depot repair support.  Estimated quantities include 65 each U.S. Navy AMPCD systems plus 35 each spares, with options for a total of 85 Foreign Military Sales (FMS)/Allied AMPCD systems, and an option for up to 20 additional systems.  The production support element of this procurement will include, but is not limited to, platform integration and support and depot level repair of repairables.   Deliveries will be made to various locations throughout the continental United States as well as to FMS customers.  Delivery will be required to begin within 13 months from the date of modification award or option exercise.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. There is an AMPCD FRP competitive procurement currently in process; however, hardware deliveries under that contract will not be delivered in time to prevent downing fleet aircraft in early FY 2005.  Therefore, as the designer, developer, and currently the sole manufacturer of the AMPCD, only Honeywell has the requisite knowledge, experience, technical data, and qualified AMPCD system required at this time to successfully support critical near term fleet requirements. While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability to respond to this requirement and may submit information which shall be considered by the Naval Air Systems Command.  All inquiries may be directed to Clare Carmack via fax 301-757-5955 or sent via email to: carmackcc@navair.navy.mil.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

The diesel engine generator set simulation software will be used to simulate a diesel operational engine (Caterpillar 3512B).  The student station will receive simulated inputs as if a real engine were connected.  The student station configuration will include the diesel generator control panel, the diesel local control panel, the laptop computer system and a two-dimensional photo engraved engine generator mockup.  The DLCP will have the physical appearance of the tactical DLCP and will simulate or stimulate the operations of the tactical DLCP.  Attached to the top of the DLCP will be the engine vision interface module.  This module will link data to the DGCP.  Other modules linking to the DLCP are the electronic control modules, the versatile control module and the integrated temperature sensor module.  The DLCP will provide necessary data to the laptop computer system.  This data will enable correct diagnostic processing with the CAT Electronic Technician (ET) Tool.  The interface between the Caterpillar ET Tool and the DLCP is proprietary and the government does not own the documentation to support it.  There will be no government furnished equipment or government furnished information in the production of this system.

Per the Debt Collections Improvement Act of 1996, The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFAR) requires all contractors to register in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contract Registration (CCR) Database.

The solicitation will contain a seed project upon which evaluation of proposals will be based.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the seed project is 233320 and the Standard is $27.5 million.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Combat Support Systems, System Program office at Eglin AFB, FL, is requesting information and potential sources for a system performance based contract, which will provide a Large Shelter System. The Large Shelter System (LSS) primary goals are to provide an air transportable aircraft hangar to support advanced fighter aircraft at expeditionary airfields worldwide. The LSS should meet performance requirements while reducing the airlift footprint and erection rate over current portable aircraft hangars in the Air Force inventory.  The objective is to find a solution/design while maximizing the use of commercial parts and processes with limited development.  

The purpose of this procurement will be to design, develop, produce, and support a replacement for the Bare Base Aircraft Hangar (ACH) by using existing commercial technology, development of a new design, or a combination of both. The LSS will include a shelter, an integrated environmental control system (ECS), a complete lighting and electrical distribution system, and suitable packaging to allow the LSS to operate as a deployable aircraft hanger.  An operational and maintenance manual with illustrated parts breakdown shall be developed according to military specifications.  To enable the program office to develop an acquisition strategy that reduces program risk by utilizing cost as an independent variable (CAIV), cost estimates are requested in categories such as:  Development non-recurring engineering, prototype hardware development; Production costs to include projected production unit cost of a LSS (specify quantity of systems unit cost is based on) with major subsystem cost breakout if possible.

SHELTER: The LSS will require minimum interior dimensions of 95 feet long, 78 feet wide, and 26 feet high at the center of the structure.  The LSS must be capable of being fully erected and operational with no more than 10 personnel in no more than 32 hours.  The LSS must be capable of withstanding 20 assembly/disassembly cycles with 25 desired. The shelter must provide at a minimum one aircraft entry door, one vehicle entry door (12’ W x 14’ H), and two personnel doors.  Information is requested regarding the impact (cost, shipping weight, erection time) of a shelter design that provides a “pass through” capability (ex. two aircraft doors). A fall protection system must be included as an add-on-kit and shall be generic in nature to allow use by more than one type of aircraft.  The LSS must be capable of withstanding 100 MPH winds with 110 MPH desired.  The LSS must support a snow load of 10 pounds per foot with 20 pounds per foot desired. The LSS must provide properly designed anchoring kits to ensure proper anchoring in all applicable soil types and asphalt/concrete pavements where shelters could reasonably be used.  Once deployed the installed/erected shelters and ECUs must be capable of continual use for a minimum of 1 year with 2 years desired.  Shelters should utilize simple, quick-disconnect type fastening systems vice screws, bolts, and nuts.  Hardware and similar components requiring maintenance and/or periodic replacement should be commercially available.  

ECS: The shelter must be capable of functioning and supporting operations at locations where ambient temperatures range between –25 F to +125 F while maintaining inside shelter temperatures of not less than +55 F and not more than +80 F. Heating and cooling units are to be rugged, portable units capable of being repeatedly transported by land, sea, and air.

ELECTRICAL: The LSS must interface with commercial and Bare Base electrical utility systems. All interior electrical components and wiring methods shall be rated for Class 1, Division 2 hazardous location. Internal lighting up to 100 foot-candles at 4’ above the floor and convenience outlets must be provided.  

PACKAGING: The shelters must be packed in suitable, deployable storage and shipping containers to provide protection from weather during movement and long term storage.  Containers and components must be compatible with the 463L pallet system.  All single components of the shelter system shall be capable of being safely handled by 10K all-terrain forklifts. The weight and cube of the shelter must be reduced by 25% over the existing Bare Base ACH with specific interest in reducing the number of pallet positions required to deploy the LSS.  A maximum of (4) 463L pallet positions shall be used to transport the basic LSS (excluding the HVAC units).  The weight of the ACH is 35,955 lbs.

It will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), contract awarded on a Best Value basis. The Synopsis/Solicitation release date is projected to be in late November 03 and will be released through CBD announcement, and by electronic posting to <http://www.eps.gov>.  Program information will be placed on the Internet as it becomes available, to include the synopsis/solicitation, test plan with methodology, and evaluation criteria.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Special Projects Office (DARPA/SPO) researches, develops, demonstrates and transitions technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges.  SPO investments range from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems.  SPO is developing technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities, used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.  SPO is also developing significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAV's and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance.  SPO is investing in novel space sensing approaches and extremely large space structures to enable tactical sensing from space.  Finally, investments are being made in technologies to provide full-scale comprehensive collective protection systems against the threat of chemical and biological attack.  In all of these areas, SPO efforts encompass the full range of activities required to develop complete prototype systems, from hardware development and characterization to algorithms, exploitation techniques, and full-scale system experimentation.  To support this range of efforts, SPO is also home to DARPA's expertise in the areas of advanced sensor systems and guidance and navigation technologies.  SPO is soliciting innovative concepts for research efforts in several advanced technologies.  Proposed efforts may address the development of prototype components, or systems; studies and modeling of existing or proposed systems; and data collections that will overcome deficiencies in existing data.  Areas of interest include systems and component technologies to address a variety of chem/bio threats, including threats to buildings, to mass transportation nodes, to urban environments, and from mail/packages; the development of robust and complete detection systems for defense against chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents; the development of both the scientific foundation and the technologies to enable U.S. dominance over the proliferating threat posed by the use of adversarial underground structures; concepts for space-based tactical sensing including optical, infrared, radio-wave, microwave, and millimeter-wave sensors, both active and passive; novel materials and technologies to enable space operations; very large, low-cost, lightweight, and low-power-density phased arrays; ultra-wideband phased arrays; significant military capability improvement in the area of guidance and navigation; and other advanced concepts in sensors and signal processing.  Attachment 1 provides additional information and POCs for these areas of interest.  This information is provided to focus interest on innovative concepts that contribute to ongoing SPO investments, but is not meant to preclude white papers on other research efforts.  PROGRAM SCOPE  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY 02 and may occur at any time through the closing date as funds are available.  White papers and proposals determined to not be of interest under this BAA will not be considered if resubmitted unless significant changes in the approach or new technical information becomes available.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with typically no more than $1M per year.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $25M over the time period it remains open.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  GENERAL INFORMATION  SPO is accepting white papers in response to this BAA.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offerer whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  A SPO Program Manager and/or technical agent most closely related to the submitted topic will review white papers and provide a written response by e-mail to the offerer within 30 days.  Those offerers whose white papers are found to be of interest and consistent with the intent of this BAA will be encouraged to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such encouragement does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.   Those offerers whose white papers are not found to be of interest to the cognizant Program Manager and/or technical agent will be provided feedback regarding why their proposal is not of interest.  This does not preclude the offerer from still submitting a full proposal.  A minimum of 45 days will be afforded potential offeroes for submission of full proposals in response to the BAA.  All awards will be subject to availability of government funds.  Awards will be made to those offerers whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the government.  The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or minority institutions (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries.  DARPA/SPO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government.  The point of contact for classified responses is Mr. Frank Purdy, DARPA/SPO, and he can be reached at 703-248-1522.   Those offerers submitting white papers are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offerer is a large, small, woman-owned, small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution.  The white paper should follow the same general format as described for Volume I under PROPOSAL FORMAT but include only Section I and II A and D.  Section I:  	Administrative, including Cost Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)  Section II:	Summary of Proposal  Innovative claims for the proposed research  D.  Technical rationale, technical approach and constructive plan  Each cost proposal shall contain a section addressing the following: Awards made under this initiative are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerers and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offerer supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the offerer believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.  Only those offerers whose proposal is expected to result in contract award will be required to submit a completed and signed copy of "Representations, Certifications, and other Statements by Offerers or Respondents".  This document is not required for the submission of a proposal unless specifically requested. Offerers are notified that this document is frequently updated and any offerer selected for award may be requested to submit an updated "Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements by Offerers or Respondents."   White Paper format and complete instructions for proposal preparation can be found at Attachment 2.  EVALUATION CRITERIA  Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit  b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA Mission   c) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition  d) Offerer's Capabilities and Related Experience  e) Cost Realism  The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.  Only (a) and (b) above will apply to white papers.

<DESC>THE VIRTUAL SOLDIER, SOL BAA 03-02, Addendum 4, DUE 043003, POC: DR. RICHARD SATAVA, DARPA/DSO, Fax: (571) 218-4629, Email: baa03-02@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso. THE VIRTUAL SOLDIER Program represents a DSO thrust area that will comprise a multi-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach to establish a new capability that will revolutionize medical care to support the soldier.  The program will create the mathematical modeling approaches to develop an information (computational) representation of an individual soldier (a holographic medical electronic representation or holomer) that can be used to augment medical care on and off the battlefield with a new level of integration.  This virtual soldier will be based upon a highly complex model that is derived from biologically driven principles and populated with properties that are extracted from evidence-based data.  The initial Phase 1 effort will consist of a two-component, three-dimensionally displayed model, 1) An Organ-tissue System model component and; 2) a Properties Level model component.  Once derived, the virtual soldier will provide multiple capabilities, including but not limited to automatic diagnosis of battlefield injuries (this Phase 1), prediction of soldier performance, testing and evaluation of non-lethal weapons, and virtual clinical trials.  In order to create a virtual soldier, integrated, inter-disciplinary teaming will be necessary; proposers are welcome to submit a single institution or multi-institution, multi-disciplinary proposal that covers one or several of the components.  All researchers in this virtual solider program are expected to collaborate extensively with other participants during the DARPA sponsored meetings and throughout the development toward the single demonstration (see below), in order to integrate the technologies and meet the program goals.  The following areas are required in order to construct a holomer and conduct the Phase 1 demonstration: (1) Global Architecture ¡V A generalizable, scalable ontology to characterize the holomer and provide the architecture that will be the infrastructure that integrates all other components (organ-tissue system model and properties-level model).  The milestone will be an architecture with descriptors for each major organ/system that assigns attributes to each system, incorporates all levels of properties (genetic, molecular, biochemical, cellular, physiologic, organ, tissue and whole body) and provides inter-operable cross-linkages from level to level and system to system. (2) Organ-tissue system model component.  This model component will consist of the different organs and tissue systems (e.g., heart, lung, liver, etc.) that need to be modeled and integrated at each level (see below).  Because of the enormous complexity of the human body, the organ systems to be modeled in this Phase 1 will be certain individual organs of the chest cavity, specifically the chest wall, heart, great vessels, lung and aorta; subsequent Phases will address other organs and tissues (e.g., liver, kidney, hemopoetic, lymphatic, etc.) systems.  The milestone will be a full 3-D representation of the chest cavity with segmented heart, great vessels, lung and aorta of a generic model (visible human dataset is acceptable) which is fully interactive for display, query and modeling of a penetrating injury of each of the structures. (3) Properties-levels model.  These models will consist of the different levels of representation (genetic, molecular, cellular, physiologic, organ or total body) that must be modeled within each organ-tissue system.  For Phase 1 (to add properties to the heart only) the levels to be modeled may include the cellular, molecular (biochemical), physiologic (including electrophysiology, mechanics, hemodynamics, etc.) and total organ structure.  Excluded are genetic, tissue and cardio-vascular system (only the heart is to be modeled with properties, the remainder of organs mentioned above will only have their anatomic shapes modeled).  The modeling dynamics must be able to respond to a penetrating wound of the heart by predicting the expected response at each level to the wounding forces. (4) Automatic segmentation of organ-tissue systems.  The individual organ-tissue system models (e.g., heart, lung, great vessels, etc.) on the whole-organ level must be automatically derived (segmented) from commercially available imaging modalities (Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), etc.) in a form that can be visually displayed in three dimensions as the organ.  In addition, the database that provides the dataset for automatically storing and displaying the segmented image of the organ must also be capable of storing the data for every property of each organ.  In Phase 1, only the heart will be segmented and stored with the properties described above. (5) Holomer display and interface.   The display of the virtual soldier must bear a high-fidelity resemblance to the real soldier data - for Phase 1, the image of the heart must look exactly like the actual heart (see demonstration below).  In addition, interaction with the display must be absolutely intuitive ¡V manipulating and interacting with the holomer must resemble as close as possible the actions that would be performed on a real person. (6) Holomer storage, retrieval and interoperability.  The dataset for the project must be storable on the U.S. Army Personnel Information Carrier (PIC or ¡§electronic dog tag¡¨).  This data must be able to be transferred to a number of platforms and medical records (open architecture) to include the medic hand-held computer, standard laptop, standard desktop personal computer, DoD hospital-based medical record and Veterans Administration (VA) electronic medical record. (7) Demonstration.   There will be a single demonstration that meets not only the individual project milestones, but also the integration of the individual projects into a unified program.  Since the success of the Phase 1 depends upon the successful prediction of outcomes, each of the components will not be considered successful unless the entire demonstration succeeds; therefore consensus of operating standards and interface methodology and continuous interaction among the participants is required. The demonstration that will be conducted in18 months to prove the validity of the virtual soldier (holomer) concept will be in a porcine model of an event from the Wound Data and Munitions Effectiveness Team (WDMET) database.  After a CT scan of the porcine chest, the anatomic model of the heart (and representational models of the chest wall, lung, great vessels and aorta) will be derived through automatic segmentation and the properties (on the properties-levels agreed upon) will be added to only the heart database. This will be stored on a PIC.  The selected event will be initiated, and there will be continuous monitoring until completion of protocol.  There will be two model comparisons made, which must have at least a p> 0.80 correlation:  1) The structural abnormalities of the modeled heart must predict the actual anatomic abnormalities documented at protocol completion and 2) The physiologic response of the event model of the cardiovascular system must follow and predict the actual recording of the same parameters during the demonstration of the event. The submission formatting and requirements of the master BAA 03-02 are to be considered in addition to the guidelines provided herein.  The minimum requested for your proposal to this Addendum is:  Part I -  Technical  1)Problem definition ¡V in one-two paragraphs state clearly what problem you will solve;  2) Previous experience/success in the specific subject matter area (component) ¡V maximum one page;  3) Technical Solution Summary of your innovative solution to the problem, including how you will integrate with the other component areas ¡V no more than two pages;  4) Tasks ¡V simply list (in outline form) the tasks that will be performed (listed as Task 1, 2  etc.) with subtasks and the last subtask as a specific deliverable; 5) Statement of Work (SOW) ¡V for each Task listed above, describe the problem to be solved, how you will solve the problem and what are the possible barriers to success ¡V this is the technical description of the work which will primarily determine the acceptability of the proposal (images and diagrams are encouraged);  6) Timeline graph ¡V listing both the milestones and deliverables;  7)  Facilities/equipment ¡V very brief one or two paragraph description of resources;   8)  Personnel qualifications - of the PI and major participants (maximum of 2 pages each).  You may list (with a one sentence description) any advisors/consultants that bring unique qualifications, however no curriculum vitae should be included.  Part II - Budget.

<DESC>This is a modification to a previous notice.

The following information is provided as clarification:  The Advanced GPS Inertial Navigation Demonstration (AGINT) and Miniature Integrated Navigation Technology (MINT) programs are referenced in Section 1 of the MIND PRDA.  There are no published reports available for these programs.  A conference paper (AIAA 99-4481) on the AGINT program was presented at the 1999 AIAA Space Technology Conference and Exposition held on 28-30 September 1999 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  However, detailed knowledge of the AGINT and MINT programs is not a prerequisite for the MIND program.  The MIND PRDA does not require any specific technology concepts which are exclusive to the AGINT or MINT contractors.  The AGINT and MINT programs are not listed in any MIND requirement nor are they included in the evaluation criteria.  The MIND PRDA states that the goal of the MIND program is to develop a navigator with nearly an order of magnitude smaller size requirement, which is a significant difference.  Also, the evaluation criteria includes the assessment of unique and innovative concepts which significantly advance the state-of-the-art.  The Contracting Officer for the AGINT and MINT programs is Ms. Brenda Soler, 850-882-4294 ext 3206, Brenda.soler@eglin.af.mil.

The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the DS&T's Chief Scientist announce a Fiscal Year 2003 competition for the
DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program. The mission of the DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program is to
establish long-term relationships and mentoring of postdoctoral researchers and to provide research institutes with an
understanding of the Intelligence Community's research requirements. The program will foster partnerships with postdoctoral researchers as they move into career positions and provide innovative solutions to Critical Intelligence Community problems. Through this competition, the Chief Scientist (CS) expects to make awards in specific research topics. All awards will be based on merit competition. Depending on the quantity and quality of proposals received, the CS may not make any award(s) under a particular research topic. In the event more funds become available additional awards maybe made at a later date based on
initial evaluation results. Typically each award will be: for a basic period of one year (funded incrementally), with a potential
option for a second and third year, and for the amount of $100,000 per year/per grant. This DCI Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship Program competition is specifically for the research topics listed below. Offerors are advised to read the Broad
Agency Announcement BAA NMA 501-03-BAA-0001 at www.nima.mil/poc/contracts/baa.html. It explains the program
research needs upon which the topics are based and the terms and conditions of this competition. 

AREAS OF INTEREST: The BAA describes twenty-two (22) research areas, comprising some of the Intelligence Community's most current technology interests. These descriptions provide offerors with a frame of reference. The DCI encourages innovative ideas that address these interests. Offerors are urged to consider the research issues posed and, as appropriate, to contact our research topic chiefs to discuss potential efforts. Inquiries are welcome. Note that while technical contacts are listed for a topic, proposals must be submitted only to the addressees shown in the Broad Agency Announcement. With completion of the first phase, the call in this announcement is seeking qualified postdoctoral research investigators interested in being funded to support research in the specified topical areas and to support interactions with the Intelligence Community advisors. Potential Fellows must be associated with an accredited U.S. university or college. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must be a U.S. citizen. The principal investigator / university mentor, is NOT required to be an U.S. Citizen. 

SUBMISSION HIGHLIGHTS. The Government will evaluate all proposals submitted under the terms and conditions of this
BAA. Government-paid consultants or subject matter experts may be involved in the evaluation and selection processes.
General. The CS, through NIMA as his executive agent, intends to award with FY03 funding. To be considered and evaluated
the Government must receive the full proposal by the due time and date (26 March 2003) identified in the BAA. NIMA will
send the offeror an acknowledgment of receipt of the submission, and will follow-up later with a notification letter announcing
whether the proposal is being recommended for an award. Acknowledgment and notification will be sent to the principal
investigator via e-mail, according to the schedule in the BAA, with a copy to the appropriate university administrative office.
Proposals will be evaluated against criteria in the BAA. The estimated grant start date identified in BAA should be used for
budget and proposal purposes. You may, however, request a later start date and may therefore develop your budget based on
your proposed start date. Submission. Proposals shall be formatted as one .doc file (or "zipped".doc file) of a size not to
exceed 1.95 Megabytes in total. The Government's mail servers will not accept files of a greater size. The proposal shall
reference BAA Number NMA 501-03-BAA-0001. Proposals shall be submitted electronically by e-mail and simultaneously
to MoorJA@nima.mil and mpf it@ticomeast.com. Content: Proposals must be complete and self-contained to qualify for
review. Proposals shall be prepared single-spaced in 12-point Times New Roman font, with at least one-inch margins on top,
bottom and sides, on 8½" by 11" paper. The Intelligence Community is concerned with research in specific areas of science
and engineering. For this reason, all proposals must adequately describe the technical objectives and approaches, support of
principal investigator and Postdoctoral Fellow, and expenditures for equipment, all of which will be evaluated by qualified
reviewers. Separate attachments, such as institutional brochures or reprints that are not germane to the proposal, are
discouraged. The proposal shall include all of the following items. Cover Page The cover page shall include the BAA number
(NMA501-03-BAA-0001), proposal title, and topic or research area of interest. The cover page must also indicate the name,
phone number, fax number, postal address, and e-mail address of both the principal investigator AND an appropriate official in
the university's research administration office. 

Project Description: The project description portion of the proposal shall be limited to three pages and shall: Describe the
proposed research objectives and approach to be undertaken. State the objectives and approach and the relationship to
state-of-knowledge in the field and to similar work in progress. Include appropriate literature citations and prior work. Discuss
the nature of expected results. Describe the expected outcomes and relevance to the Intelligence Community research need.
Identify other parties to whom the proposal has been/will be sent. 

Resume: The Resume shall be limited to two (2) pages each and shall provide the credentials of the principal investigator,
demonstrating why the offeror is qualified to do the work proposed. If a Postdoctoral Fellow has been identified, an additional resume, two (2) pages in length, may also be included. 

Cost: Beginning on a new page, the financial portion of the proposal should contain cost estimates in sufficient detail for
meaningful review. The annual cost must be no greater than $100,000. At least 50% of this cost should be allocated for direct
support of one full-time Postdoctoral Fellow, including salary and fringe benefits. The remaining funds can be allocated to a
fraction of the principal investigator's time, unique equipment needed to conduct the proposed research, other direct costs and
university overhead. For proposal purposes, use the later of the estimated award start date per BAA or the offeror's proposed
start date. Exceptions to the above-recommended allocation will need to be approved by the Chief Scientist. The cost proposal
must include the total cost of the project, as well as a breakdown of the amounts by source of funding (e.g., funds requested from the DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program, and/or institutional funds to be provided as cost sharing). The costs should be broken down for each year of the program and shown by three distinct totals: a total for the basic year and a total for each of the optional follow-on years. Although expected to be short, there is no page limit for the cost section of the proposal. Cost elements should include, but are not limited to: Time being charged to the project by the principal investigator and Postdoctoral Fellow, and their commensurate salaries and benefits. Costs of equipment based on most recent quotations and
broken down in sufficient detail for evaluation (equipment costs should be budgeted primarily during the first year). Allowable
equipment will ordinarily be limited to research equipment and apparatus not already available for the conduct of the work.
General-purpose equipment, such as a personal computer, is not eligible for support unless primarily used in the actual conduct
of the proposed scientific research. Travel costs and time, and the relevance to stated objectives. This shall include a
breakdown of the name and number of travelers, location and duration; and estimated costs for transportation, rental car and
per-diem. This shall also include travel for the required attendance at the annual DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
Program colloquium in the spring of each year. The colloquium is held in the Washington D.C. area. Other direct costs such as
materials and supplies; publication, documentation and dissemination; computer services; communication costs not included in overhead; or others (identify). These costs shall include at least one published article per year in the Journal of Intelligence Community Research and Development (JICRD). This published article will need to be coordinated, vetted and submitted through the IC Advisor. Cetifications: By signing and submitting any proposal under this BAA, the offeror is certifying
Certification at Appendix A to 32 CFR Part 25 regarding debarment, suspension, and other responsibility matters; Certification at Appendix C to 32 CFR Part 25 regarding drug-free workplace requirements; and Certification at Appendix A to 32 CFR
Part 28 regarding lobbying. These certifications are located in Parts 25 and 28 of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulation
(DoDGARs), D0D 3210.6-R. This document is available electronically, under the heading "publications", at the following
Internet site: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/. The person who is authorized to provide these certifications should sign the
proposal. Proposals submitted without signatures shall require a separate execution of the certifications. Also, it will be
necessary for either the Dean or Provost at the University to acknowledge that they are receiving CIA Funds. Awards will be
made for one year with two one-year options. The Government expects to exercise the first year option assuming quality
research is ongoing. Second year option will be the exception, rather than the rule. The awards will be incremental funded at
funding levels no greater than $100,000 per year, per award/option period. Once a proposal is selected for award, one of two scenarios will be executed: If a postdoctoral candidate is already identified and prepared to begin the proposed research,
100% of the first year's award funding could be provided by the start date. If a qualified postdoctoral candidate must be
sought, $10,000 of the award amount will be provided initially, with the remaining first year's funding provided when the
qualified candidate is identified and selected by the university.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division  (NOTSD) requires development, fabrication, testing and logistics support for the Virginia Class Submarine (VSSN) Emergency Diesel Generator Control Panel (DGCP) Front Panel Simulator (FPS).   The successfully tested and completed trainer shall be delivered to NAVSUBSCOL, New London, CT.  The primary use of this trainer will be to teach operation, casualty and degraded modes, maintenance, engine troubleshooting and fault isolation skills.  The diesel engine generator set simulation software will be used to simulate a diesel operational engine (Caterpillar 3512B).  The student station will receive simulated inputs as if a real engine were connected.  The student station configuration will include the diesel generator control panel, the diesel local control panel, the laptop computer system and a two-dimensional photo engraved engine generator mockup.  The DLCP will have the physical appearance of the tactical DLCP and will simulate or stimulate the operations of the tactical DLCP.  Attached to the top of the DLCP will be the engine vision interface module.  This module will link data to the DGCP.  Other modules linking to the DLCP are the electronic control modules, the versatile control module and the integrated temperature sensor module.  The DLCP will provide necessary data to the laptop computer system.  This data will enable correct diagnostic processing with the CAT Electronic Technician (ET) Tool.  The interface between the Caterpillar ET Tool and the DLCP is proprietary and the government does not own the documentation to support it.  There will be no government furnished equipment or government furnished information in the production of this system.  Interested companies should respond with the following information:  1) Past performance on government contracts of like or similar nature;  2) Whether your company intends to bid as a prime or subcontractor; 3) Size and status (based on the related small business size standard of 750 employees).  4)  Describe ability to develop the logistics elements required to support this trainer. These elements include configuration management, provisioning, and operation and maintenance documentation.This announcement is for market research purposes only. The Government does not intend to pay for information received. Submissions should be made in writing or via e-mail only.

<DESC>NA DESC:  The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential contractors for the Development Program to Broaden and Strengthen Current Unique Domestic X-ray Detector Manufacturing Capabilities from cadmium zinc telluride (CZT). The Army has developed and is continuing to develop advanced x-ray radiographic and tomographic systems using a new patented x-ray radiography-tomography technology utilizing photonic energy discrimination.  Although these digital x- ray imaging systems are superior to other digital x-ray imaging systems, full implementation and production has been stymied by the low production yield of CZT detector arrays having photonic throughput greater than one million photons per second per pixel and array size greater than one centimeter by one centimeter by three millimeter.  TACOM-ARDEC hereby requests that any firm, which both manufactures the CZT crystals and manufactures the pixilated arrays from the crystals and is capable of performing research, development, and implementation to improve their manufacturing yield up to one hundred square centimeters of tested high quality pixilated material per week during the first year, provide a Statement of Capability and supporting rationale to Mr. Stephen A. Ernyey at area code (973) 724-3456 so that it may be properly evaluated prior to synopsis and solicitation of the requirement.  In addition, please provide the company’s name, address, and point of contact with telephone number and email address, size of business (small/large) and country represented. It is currently the intention of TACOM-ARDEC to issue a sole-source award to II- VI Inc., 375 Saxonburg Blvd., Saxonburg, PA 16056. This is a market survey for information only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government.

<CONTACT>Beverly Gonzales, 256-842-7408
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) desires industry interface to gain information on available products and technologies to further define/refine the requirements and the acquisition approach specifically for the Electro-Optic (EO) project ion component of the Multi-Spectral Subsystem (MSS)of the Objective Mobile Infrared Scene Projector (MIRSP).  The MSS will be a subsystem of the Objective MIRSP and the MSS will be used to test and evaluate EO sensorsby providing both dynamic scenes and st atic fixed scenes.  The MSS will be a modular and transportable subsystem and will provide EO stimulation for the Unit-Under-Tests (UUTs) in the following spectral bands: Ultraviolet (UV), visible monochrome, visible color, Near Infrared (NIR), Mid-WaveInf rared (MWIR), and Long Wave Infrared (LWIR).  Presently, test and evaluation (T&E) organizations utilize resistive-array-based Infrared Scene Projections (IRSP) for developmental testing of tactical IR sensors in the laboratory environment.  The IR resisti ve array consists of a packaged integrated circuit combined with several hundred thousand micro-resistors (micro-emitters) which each emit individually controlled IR energy when a current is passed through them.  However, T&E of EO sensors are not limited to IR only.  There is a T&E need to stimulate EO sensors in multi-spectral bands as mentioned previously usig scene projection technology.  The current state-of-the-art in EO scene projection is represented utilizing a Texas Instrument Digital Micromirror Device (DMD)containing 858x600 pixels.  These devices are sufficient for some testing of presently fielded sensor systems.  However, they do not provide the necessary resolution and characteristics to fully test advanced-sensors presently fielded or under development.  Subsystem test laboratories, and installed systems test facilities, both need higher resolution EO scene projectors (up to 1280x1024 pixel format in the near term) to cost effectively test the next generation of sensor systems in the confines  of the laboratory, depot, chamber, and hangar.  Information is being requested at this time specifically on developed COTS, emerging technology and products on EO scene projector technology having the following characterists: DMD array for an EO scene projector with a large format configuration of 1280x1024 pixel format. Technically sound designs, approaches and processes to fabricate, package and cool the DMD projector. Continuous projector emission over 0.2 to 14 micron spectral range (UV to LWIR). Emit dynamic and radiometrically accurate EO images of targets and battlefield/test environments that replicate scenes as presented to the sensors in real world scenarios. Technically sound designs and approaches to perform projection at real time frame rates of up to 100 Hz. Windowing techniques at higher frame rates for applications that require lower resolution (e.g., 512x1024) stimulation. Emphasis on uniformity, pixel yield, and heat load. Form, fit and function that provide portability, mobility and reconfigurability needed to fully support installed system testing. The Objective MIRSP Integrated Product Team believes industry feedback is vitally important, and will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  The Government does not intend to pay for the requested information nor respond to submissions.   Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  Please limit formal white paper submission to no more than 5 pages to include cover letter and white paper.  In addition, you may include up to 5 attachments that consist of pre-printed brochures and/or related commercial product literatures.  Responses to this synopsis may be submitted via electronic mail to gayle.norman@redstone.army.mil or mail responses to: U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Co mmand, AMSAM-AC-RD-AX, ATTN: Gayle Norman, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 35898.

<ARCHDATE>05272003
<CONTACT>Michele Williams, 256-955-3388
<DESC>NA The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine if a sufficient number of small business concerns exist to obtain adequate competition to support a determination for small business set-aside.  Large businesses should not respond at this time. This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in the PEO-Soldier Support Services competition at the prime contractor level, and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested s mall business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The capability papers and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm’s or team’s ability to perform; that evaluation wil l be part of the formal source selection process. As the Government is unsure of the extent of anticipated small and small disadvantaged business participation, it is undecided as to how many and/or what types of set-aside awards to target during the development of its acquisition strategy.  The extent of  small business participation is made more complicated by the Small Business Administration (SBA) rules on affiliation, teaming, and limitations on subcontracting.  Briefly, small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award o f a set-aside contract, providing that each team member meets the NAICS code small business definition for that procurement.  The rules allow a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small businesses or small business  teams when at least 50% of the services will be performed by the small business or the collective efforts of all small business members of the team.  Further, the current affiliation rules allow 8(a) joint ventures or teams when each team member is small according to the applicable NAICS Code and the 8(a) concern performs a “significant amount” of the work with its own employees.  Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA.  Small Businesses should note the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard is 541710/1000 employees.   The contractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for systems engineering and technical assistance in support of the Mission and Function Statements for the PEO-Soldier and it’s subordinate Project/Product Managers (PMs), including, PM Sold ier Warrior (PM S-WAR); Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW); and Project Manager Soldier Sensors and Equipment (PM S-SEQ).  PEO-Soldier and PM Soldier Sensors and Equipment (S-SEQ) is located at Ft. Belvoir.  PM Soldier Warrior (S-WAR) is located at bo th Ft. Belvoir and Huntsville AL.  PM Soldier S-SW is located at Picatinny, NJ.   This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The planned scope of work (SOW) has fourteen (14) functional areas:  Requirements Definition, Integration, and Planning ; Strategic, Program, Security and Acquisition Planning; Technology Development Support, Combat System Development Support, Weapon System Development Support, Assessment, and Validation; Threat Estimation/Projections; Weapons Lethality and Effects Estimati on; Modeling, Simulation, and Interfacing; Software Development Support, Software Independent Verification and Validation, System Integration Support, and Configuration Management Support; Program/Project Analysis, Evaluation, Experimentation, Budget and C ost Estimation, and Program Management Support; Production and Fielding Support; Government Property, Logistics, and Operations Support; Liaison and Public Affairs Support; Test Planning and Execution; Communications Support; and Administrative and Graphic s Support.  This acquisition will result in at least two (2) awards with identical SOWs and numbers of person-hours.  The contracts will consist of fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbursable travel and materials line items.   The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams).  Further, we do  not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.  The resultant contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other PEO – Soldier contracts.   To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Government’s interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractor’s actual PEO-Soldier Support Services performance.  Any small business firms, including 8(a) firms, intending to propose as a prime contractor (especially those planning to use the SBA affiliation and teaming rules) are requested to submit a capability paper to the Government (limited to 5 pages).  Interest ed firms should submit an email stating your interest in the acquisition and including the requested paper to the Government within 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement to michele.williams@smdc.army.mil (title email “PEO-Soldier Support Ser vices Capability Paper”).   The capability papers should focus on issues that affect the decision as to number/types of set-aside awards such as: (1) the breadth and depth of technical and management expertise to successfully execute the resultant contract, (2) the capability to quic kly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the contract, (3) the capability to administer and manage an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract (expected to be a minimum of $7M per year for the total program) with nume rous subcontractors, (4) assurance that the small business firm or small business team will perform 50% of the work, (5) capability to perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical and integration efforts, (6) a contract management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable for total performance responsibility, and (7) an understanding of Army, DoD, and Government Agencies with whom PEO-Soldier interface. This acquisition will not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only.  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered F05604-02-R-0017.  Numbered notes 1 and 26 apply.  While the action being advertised is likely to occur, the amount of information available for publication at this time is limited. The solicitation, when issued, will be a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not anticipated at this time that the acquisition will be commercial (FAR Part 12).  A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection.    

The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson AFB CO seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal services in support of the mission of the 21st Communications Squadron, Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado. These services include support of operations, maintenance and management of the Peterson complex Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) to include unclassified and Multi-level Secure System (MLS) and classified network support, secure dial-in services (e.g., Virtual Private Networking), wireless services, network management, system administration, trouble ticketing (e.g., Remedy ARS), Information Assurance and security, configuration management and control, Internet and Intranet, hardware and software maintenance (to include Defense Messaging System (DMS) and others), help desk services and engineering and technical support to the 21ST Communications Squadron.  Work includes integration and expansion of the Peterson Air Force Base Network  (LAN and WAN) as well as assistance to the Air Force and DoD civilian personnel in the areas of responsibility under the statement of work.  The potential exists for some services to migrate off of this requirement after contract award due to consolidations efforts at the Major Command (MAJCOM) level.  The contractor shall also interface with other contractors or government agencies in support of issues dealing with the evolution of Peterson Complex communications systems in areas where the contractor is the functional manager, i.e., LAN and WAN.  These services shall be performed on a 24-hour-per-day 7-day-per-week basis.  This listing should be considered neither final nor all-inclusive at this time.


The contract performance period will be a base period of one year and four one year option periods, exercised at the unilateral right of the Government.  The proposed contract type will be cost plus award fee or cost plus incentive fee.   The North American Industry Classification Code is 513310.  The small business size standard for this procurement is 1500 employees.  This requirement has historically been and is anticipated to be 100% set aside for small business.  The solicitation including the statement of work will be issued on or about January 2003, through FedBizOpps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov.   All amendments will be posted to and available for viewing on FBO.   When the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.

Subject to change, a tentative schedule of events follows:  Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and attachments to be posted on or about 15 October 2002; Industry Days and one-on-one discussions may be held on or about 9 and 10 December 2002; Request for Proposal may be released on or about 24 January 2003; Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit may be held on or about 31 January 2003; announcement of contract award on or about 27 August 2003; and transition period beginning on or about 01 September 2003.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON RESPONSES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS CODE 541710, WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. The Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), DHHS is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and capability of small business firms with the expertise to establish and implement a Clinical Studies Consortium. One award is anticipated. The Clinical Studies Consortium will be one of three components of an Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Immunization Network that will be created via contract awards in mid fiscal year 2004. The Network will have three components:  a Clinical Studies Consortium, an Animal Studies Consortium, and a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center. Each component will be established under separate contracts. Subcontracting will be encouraged. The purpose of the Clinical Studies Consortium is to develop and implement a plan to eliminate the risk for eczema vaccinatum in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients who are immunized with vaccinia. The Consortium will perform clinical studies on AD patients to evaluate innate and adaptive immune responses. These studies should provide important information about immune abnormalities that account for susceptibility to eczema vaccinatum, and should facilitate future design of safer and more effective vaccines for AD patients.  The tasks that the Clinical Studies Consortium must fulfill will be coordinated with the Animal Studies Consortium and the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center.  In their capability statement, organizations capable of fulfilling this effort, at a minimum, must demonstrate capabilities to:  1) Establish a Clinical Studies Consortium consisting of institutions capable of providing the clinical, scientific, technical and administrative expertise necessary to perform clinical studies in patients with AD; 2) Manage an organizational plan that must include processes for: a) establishing research priorities; b) reviewing, modifying, approving and disapproving research studies; c) allocating resources; d) monitoring and evaluating progress and performance; e) redirecting scientific focus and reallocating resources; and f) establishing and maintaining effective working relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and with other NIAID-supported programs on biodefense and relevant non-biodefense research; 3) Propose a governance plan for the Network Executive Committee and chair and participate in this committee, which will be the governing body of the Network for all three components; 4) Design and implement safe protocols that assess immune function and gene expression in atopic dermatitis patients, both in vivo and in vitro, in response to: a) a defined set of antigens; and b) immunization with selected attenuated viruses;  5) Obtain and store blood and tissue samples from atopic dermatitis patients; 6) Identify atopic dermatitis patients with documented disseminated vaccinia and/or disseminated herpes simplex and/or severe molluscum contagiosum infection, for recruitment in a Registry; 7) Provide appropriate resources critical to clinical, scientific, technical and administrative support in a cost-effective manner.  8) Ensure an orderly transition of contract-related activities and materials to a successor Contractor or the Government at contract completion. Interested parties must submit a written capability statement, inclusive of references, that identifies the organization's ability to perform the efforts described above.  Capability statements must identify the business status of the organization (i.e. non-profit, small business, 8(a), or other corporate or noncorporate entity). It is anticipated that the period of performance for the contracts will be five (5) years. Interested small business organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas above, to be received no later than 3:30 PM local time on March 21, 2003, to the attention of Barry Johnson at the address listed above. See Government-wide Numbered Note 22. NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Cognitive Collective-Technology Transfer Opportunity
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) has developed technology that simulates the process whereby experts from different domains interact to reach a collective decision.  For this technology, individual computational models are developed for specific individuals with expertise in certain domains or disciplines.  These models simulate the processes whereby an expert applies their unique knowledge and experience to interpret data, situations or event.  Validation studies have shown that computer models developed using associated methods for expert knowledge elicitation respond in a manner consistent with the actual expert with an accuracy of approximately 90%.

With a Cognitive Collective, cognitive models for different experts interact and in some cases, the collective recognizes a pattern where cues are insufficient for a pattern to emerge with any of the individual expert models.  A validation study compared the performance of the collective to that of the actual experts placed in a situation where they interacted with one another to reach a group decision.  The simulated collective reached the same conclusion as the actual experts for approximately 90% of the scenarios.

In operation, a user may observe individual models as they apply their knowledge to process data, as well as the interaction between individual models.  This includes the ability to playback selected time spans and observe models as they respond to various incoming data.  Additionally, visualization tools allow users to explore the knowledge within individual expert models and to compare and contrast the knowledge of models corresponding to different experts.

This technology is applicable to a broad range of problem domains in which large volumes of dispersed data must be continuously monitored for detection of patterns, events, anomalous behavior, etc.  Current prototypes use the Cognitive Collective for detection of security concerns, employing models of experts from relevant domains (e.g. counterintelligence, psychologist).  In general, this technology is suited for applications that involve strategic and tactical analysis, situation assessment, diagnosis, fault detection, data interpretation, continuous surveillance, complex pattern recognition and other similar functions.

Sandia is making this Cognitive Collective technology available to companies interested in partnering with Sandia to develop near-term and/or future applications.  For further information, please respond by mail, email or fax to Alane Dulski by April 12, 2003 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P. O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-0115.  Email:  adulsk@sandia.gov. Fax:  (505) 844-8011.  Please indicate the date and title of this CBD notice and the type of partnering agreements your company would be most interested in entering into.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Real-Time Awareness of Operator/User Cognitive Processes with the Capability to Detect Operator/User Error - Technology Transfer Opportunity
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) has developed technology that enables systems to infer the ongoing cognitive processes of an equipment operator or computer user in real-time.  For this technology, a cognitive model is developed for an operator that reflects their unique knowledge, understanding and experience with a system(s), equipment, software, task, etc.  Currently, operator models are developed through interaction with the operator, however methods are being developed to automate the data collection needed to model a given operator.  However, generic operator models may be used in some applications.  The system takes data from various sources and uses the operator’s cognitive model to interpret ongoing events in real-time.  Prototype testing has shown that these interpretations correspond to the situation awareness/recognition of an actual operator with an accuracy of approximately 90%.  Thus, the system is able to infer the ongoing cognitive processes of the operator in real-time with this level of accuracy.

Given these capabilities, systems may interact with users in a more contextually relevant and meaningful manner.  For example, one application that has been successfully prototyped provides detection of operator/user errors.  In this case, the system uses the operator’s cognitive model to interpret ongoing events.  The system also uses data obtained from observation of the operator to detect conditions in which an operator has either failed to recognize a developing situation, misinterpreted a situation or falsely believes a situation exists.  Various data concerning the operator may be used including operator actions, speech, eye-fixations, physiological indices (e.g. arousal level), etc.  Once potential error conditions have been recognized, various approaches may be used to alert the operator taking into consideration the urgency, criticality, relevance, etc. of the potential error.

Sandia is making this Real-Time Awareness of Operator/User Cognitive Processes technology available to companies interested in partnering with Sandia to develop near-term and/or future applications.  For further information, please respond by mail, email or fax to Alane Dulski by April 12, 2003 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P. O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-0115.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Human-Like Episodic Memory
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) has developed technology that simulates the processes by which humans retain and utilize a meaningful record of their past experiences.  As people go through their day-to-day lives, they store a continuous record of their experiences, which they may later recall in performing various tasks and interpreting ongoing situations.  People are also adept at using shared experience as a means to facilitate interactions with family, friends, co-workers, etc.  This technology enables a computer to store a record of experience similar to human episodic memory and utilize knowledge of its experiences with specific users as a basis for human-computer interactions.

The technology is based on unique capabilities to computationally model the cognitive processes whereby humans apply their knowledge and experience to interpret situations and events.  This modeling framework is employed to create a record of experience structured with regard to a given individuals knowledge of people, places, things, etc.  Additionally, the cognitive model provides context to episodic memory records through its inherent capacity to meaningfully interpret situations and events based on patterns of cues available to an individual.

In practice, a system equipped with episodic memory will record a continuous record of its interactions with one or more users.  This record may serve two functions.  First, there is the “peripheralization” of memory.  When users’ own memory for experience fails, they may turn to their computer-based episodic memory to ask questions such as “Where did I see this,” “When have I seen these two people together,” “What have I seen that is most like what I’m seeing now?”  Second, the machine may use episodic memory to place ongoing events within a meaningful context.  For example, when the user faces a certain problem, the computer may remind the user of a past experience with the same, or a similar, problem, as well as what the user did and what happened as a result of these actions.

Additionally, this technology may be used in the context of knowledge preservation, providing individuals access to knowledge of the experiences of other individuals.  If a given individual faces an unusual occurrence, they may ask if anyone else has had a comparable experience.  Finally, this technology may also be used to create synthetic entities for simulation and entertainment applications that possess unique life histories, which they may use to interpret and respond to ongoing events, and interact with users.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Realistic Human Cognition Modeling and Simulation - Technology Transfer Opportunity
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) has developed technology to allow realistic simulation of human cognitive processes.  This technology consists of a computational model of the mechanisms whereby humans apply their knowledge and experience to interpret data, situations and events.  Using associated methods for knowledge elicitation, models may be customized to reflect a specific individual with expertise in a given domain, or with expertise using a particular product, technology, etc.  

This technology is unique in that it emphasizes pattern recognition as an essential element of cognition, as opposed to common rule-based approaches.  This provides flexibility and an ability to respond to ambiguity that is not generally available with cognitive and behavioral models.  By varying knowledge contents, models may be created that correspond to different experts, and different tasks, activities and disciplines.  Similarly, models may be developed that capture the beliefs, perspectives and thought patterns of individuals from different cultures, interests groups, etc.  Additionally, there is a thorough integration of cognitive and emotional processes enabling models to exhibit appropriate sensitivities and motivations.  

The framework for the cognitive model simulates basic dynamics of an oscillating system in a manner consistent with findings from research concerning the underlying neurophysiology of human cognition.  This framework provides a number of parameters that may be adjusted to account for various organic factors that affect cognition (e.g. arousal, fatigue, stress, etc.)

Models may be equipped with episodic memory enabling them to record a continuous record of their experiences that may aide in the interpretation of ambiguous situations.  Another unique feature is a Comparator that serves as an anomaly detector that senses and responds to out-of-context cues or events.

In validation studies, synthetic entities created using this technology have been shown to interpret situations in a manner consistent with the actual individuals on whom models were based with an accuracy of approximately 90%.  

This technology may be used to create human-like, computer-based entities for applications that include analytic modeling and simulation, decision aides, interactive system(s), training, gaming, entertainment, as well as others, and may be readily integrated with avatar, speech synthesis and related technologies.

<SUBJECT>99--IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL NASA LARC CONTRACTORS
<DESC>As you may know, NASA is implementing IFMP, an agency-wide initiative to modernize its financial and administrative systems and processes.  NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is going "live" with the Core Financial module, the backbone of IFMP, in June 2003.  The Core Financial module provides timely, consistent, and reliable information for accounting and budgeting decisions, and facilitates improved information exchange with NASA's Centers and contractors -- laying the foundation for NASA's e-commerce and e-government initiatives. NASA LaRC is scheduled to shutdown our legacy financial systems in May 2003 and begin using the Core Financial module of IFMP the end of June 2003.  To facilitate the cutover process, we are attempting to assemble our contractor cost data early so that we can complete our May month-end closing by our established shutdown date.  You can assist us by submitting the Contractor Financial Management Reports (NASA Form 533M) for April no later than, but preferably before, Monday, May 5, 2003, if your report is not currently required before that date.  Although costs and hours reported should be based upon actual amounts incurred, we recognize that you may need to estimate some costs for the latter part of April.  If this is necessary, please ensure that the 533M for May identifies any adjustments made to the costs and hours reported for April. The Center's Deputy Chief Financial Officer for Finance has determined that it is prudent to make early payments prior to closing the legacy financial system.  Invoices received between April 16 and May 7, 2003, will not be subject to the Prompt Payment Act waiting period and will be paid early.	During the cutover period (May 16 through the end of June), NASA LaRC will be unable to make payments.  Therefore, we are encouraging contractors, where possible, to submit invoices to the address specified in the Purchase Order or Contract no later than May 7, 2003.  NASA LaRC will make every effort to pay all approved invoices that are received by May 7, 2003, prior to shutdown of our legacy financial system.  Those invoices not received and approved by May 7, 2003, may not be paid until after NASA LaRC successfully implements Core Financial.   The LaRC Financial Management and Procurement Offices will be working with you to maintain continuity of service since payment processing will be interrupted during our cutover window. As part of our cutover planning, we are currently investigating our options for making emergency payments should the need arise.  As we get closer to our shut down, we will finalize these plans and provide additional information via an announcement on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/nais/hottopic.cgi.   The Core Financial Project Team will present specific information on the cutover process and the impacts it will have on those doing business with LaRC.  The date and time of the forum is April 1, 2003, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern).  Contractors may participate in this event in person or by telephone.  If you plan to attend in person, you should so indicate by completing and faxing the BADGE AND PASS FORM linked below at this site to Peggy Lewis (757-864-4002) by March 26, 2003.  Your notification of attendance must include information on whether the individuals are U.S. Citizens, possess a green card, or are resident aliens for access to the Center.  If you plan to participate by telephone, the USA Toll Free Number is 888-889-4940.  Upon calling in you will need to provide the following PASSCODE: 12345 and the Leader name: Peggy Lewis. In order that as many questions as possible may be answered at the NASA Presentation, written questions should be submitted to Peggy Lewis (p.p.lewis@larc.nasa.gov) no than March 26, 2003.  A limited time may be available for answering questions on the day of the conference.  However, as there is no assurance that adequate time to answer such questions will remain, submission of questions prior to the conference, by the date specified above, will assure their being fully answered. We need your cooperation in this effort and ask for your patience as we transition to the new financial management system.

<SUBJECT>R -- USDA Express Review Studies for Clerical Support and Mailroom Support
<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service-Louisiana State Office (NRCS-LASO) intends to conduct two separate cost comparisons in accordance with OMB-approved USDA Express Review Study procedures.  The studies are for mailroom support functions in Alexandria, Louisiana, NAICS Code 561210 (NRCS-12-LA-03) and clerical support functions in Leesville, LA, NAICS Code 561410 (NRCS-11-LA-03).  Major mailroom support tasks include general mailroom operations (receiving, sorting, distributing, collecting, and sending mail), office reproduction services, vehicle maintenance services, central supply room operations, and pickup and delivery services.  Major clerical support tasks include general office support functions (telephone, reception, typing, filing, copying, mail, faxing, mail distribution), processing training and travel requests, maintain office bulletin board, and basic clerical research. The USDA Express Review process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity under study is regularly performed under contract by commercial activities at firm fixed prices and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modification, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new PWS or a formal solicitation. NRCS-LASO is seeking to locate commercial businesses that have experience and also have current government contracts for (a) mailroom support services and (b) clerical support services. All interested and capable parties that have expertise in (a) mailroom support services and (b) clerical support services should respond VIA E-MAIL to the contracting Officer ralph.broome@la.usda.gov with a list of their 1) contract number 2) Federal Agency name and point of contact 3) the firm fixed price of each contract 4) the period of performance covered and 5) the size and business status. NOTE: This is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for proposals; however, depending on the results of the streamlined cost comparison, a solicitation may be issued at a later date. Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Ralph Broome.

<SUBJECT>39 -- FPI Follow-up
<DESC>On January 16, 2003, FPI published in Federal Business Opportunities a 'good faith' notice regarding FPI's intent to manufacture containers for sale competitively (without using mandatory source) to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).  The January 16th notice explained that FPI does not consider USPS containers to be a 'new product' under FPI's guidelines because FPI has recorded sales in both the Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) which include USPS containers.  Under FPI's guidelines, an item's FSC code and SIC code are the primary and secondary determinant of a 'specific product,' respectively.

The January 16th notice stated that while FPI does not consider USPS containers to be a new product, FPI recognizes that a reasonable person may construe USPS containers to be a product separate and distinct from any other made by FPI.  The notice requested that interested parties submit comments regarding FPI's proposed production of containers for the USPS on a competitive basis.  FPI received comments in response to the January 16th notice from two interested parties.  Both objected to FPI's proposal to manufacture containers for the USPS, as summarized below:

The first commenter's submission stated:

1)  USPS material handling equipment are not commercial items, and, as such, are itself a specific product, separate from anything else; 

2)  If FPI were to enter this market, FPI will monopolize the market and eliminate current suppliers.

The second commenter's submission stated:

1)  USPS containers are an industry unto themselves; 

2)  The USPS container being considered by FPI is only in the design stage.  FPI must go through an extensive design and testing process for this item.  Such a process would not be necessary if the item was not a 'new product';

3)  The material handling storage fabrication industry is primarily composed of small businesses, most of which are marked by recent sales decreases and excess capacity.  The entry of FPI into this market would only create further hardship on the existing firms.

FPI forwarded both sets of comments, in their entirety, to its Presidentially-appointed Board of Directors.  It was the official decision of the Board of Directors that FPI may pursue manufacturing containers for the USPS on a competitive basis, without the use of mandatory source.

In making its decision, FPI’s Board carefully considered all of the points raised in both sets of comments.  The Board acknowledged that while there is no FSC code and SIC code exclusively for USPS containers, that does not equate to this item being a 'new product' under FPI’s guidelines.  Other items (such as different styles of push carts, hand trucks and other material handling equipment) also fall within these categories.  FPI has a history of sales in both the FSC code and the relevant SIC codes for USPS containers.

The Board also considered the comment that containers for the USPS ought to be considered a 'new product' for FPI because of the necessary design and testing process for the item.  The Board agreed that while containers for the USPS may be a 'new' item for FPI in a layman's sense because it is a prototype, that does not make it a 'new product' for purposes of product classification in accordance with FPI's published industry guidelines.

Most importantly, FPI's Board stressed that FPI would only be allowed to obtain work manufacturing containers for the USPS via competitive means.  The Board concluded that FPI may not use its mandatory source to obtain any business manufacturing containers for the USPS.  The Board decided that because FPI would only be allowed to provide USPS containers on a competitive basis, it would essentially operate as just another potential vendor.  Thus, any work awarded to FPI would be done so of the customer's own volition, because FPI was deemed to be the best source for the government.  As such, arguments that FPI's entry into the market would cause an undue burden on the industry are not valid.  The USPS will be notified that FPI is not a mandatory source for this item, and that FPI will bid for the work competitively.

For these reasons, the Board decided that containers for the USPS are not a 'new product' as defined by FPI's expansion guidelines. FPI may manufacture containers for sale to the USPS on a competitive basis, without the use of mandatory source.  USPS containers will be included within the specific product grouping 'FSC 3920 - Material Handling Equipment, Non Self-Propelled.'

Interested parties have the right to raise questions at any time with FPI's Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, 320 First Street, NW, Washington, DC  20534.
