<CONTACT>Kate McKenna Contracting Officer 2022086722     Kate_A_McKenna@nbc.gov;
<DESC>The U. S. Dept. of the Interior (DOI) is requesting Qualification Statements from interested vendors as the first step in setting up multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with vendors with qualifications in conducting Certification and Accreditation (C&A) that conform to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37 methodology. The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) is increasingly reliant on a broad range of information technology (IT) systems with varying degrees of sensitivity and criticality.  DOI has IT processing capabilities dispersed throughout the United States.  IT assets are housed and protected by state, regional, or bureau 'enclaves'.  Major nodes/data centers are located in Washington, DC; Denver, CO; Albuquerque, NM; Sacramento, CA; Portland OR; and Anchorage, AK.  Of primary concern would be to gather a list of vendors that can field C&A teams in one, some, or all locations where DOI has major nodes/data centers to lessen any additional costs incurred from travel, although all qualified vendors may submit statements.  This will be the only notice posted prior to any award.   The NIST SP 800-37 C&A methodology entails the creation of several documents based on both NIST SP series and DOI implementation/template guides which include: ·	NIST SP 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Information Techno Systems; ·	NIST SP 800-20, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems; ·	NIST SP 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems; ·	NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information Techno Systems; ·	DOI IT C&A Guide; ·	DOI Example Risk Assessment Report; ·	DOI System Security Plan Template; ·	DOI Sample IT Contingency Plan Format; ·	DOI IT Asset Valuation Guide; and ·	DOI Security Test and Evaluation Guide. In order to be considered in any acquisition as a result of this notice, interested parties must submit a qualifications statement by Midnight (EDT), October 13, 2003, demonstrating they are qualified to perform the work outlined above.  Submit to the Contracting Officer, Kate McKenna, via e-mail (Kate_A_McKenna@nbc.gov) or fax (202-208-4956).  Any inquiries regarding this request should also be submitted to the Contracting Officer in writing via the same methods.   Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. All sources responding to this synopsis shall submit information relating to their business status, including identification as to whether small, large, minority-owned, woman-owned, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned, HUBZone or 8(a) certified.  NAICS code is 541519.  The applicable size standard is $21 million.
