<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors capable of providing a doped polysilicon process upgrade in support of several on-going scientific and technical research projects in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) NanoFab laboratory. The system will be sited and used in a multi-user facility. 

After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a doped polysilicon process upgrade that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement.  If at least two qualified small business manufacturers are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

The system would need to meet the following requirements:
1. SCOPE: Upgrade existing Tystar Mini-Tytan 4600 LPCVD Undoped Polysilicon Deposition Furnace to include P and N doped Polysilicon processes.  The furnace is currently configured with a 200mm ID process tube and one SiH4 gas deposition channel.

2. SUBSTRATE SIZE: System must be capable of handling substrates from small irregular shaped pieces up to and including 150mm wafer rounds with minimal retooling necessary.

3.  BASIC PROCESS SPECIFICATIONS
3.1 P and N doping concentrations from 1 x 1015 to 5 x 1020 at/cm3
3.2 Doping uniformity across 6” wafer and 50 wafer load <5% [(max-min)/2mean]
3.3 Thickness uniformity across 6” wafer and 50 wafer load <5% [(max-min)/2mean]
3.4 Final System Leak Rate < 5mT/min after 30 min pump down from atmosphere.
3.5 Base Pressure < 5mT after 10 min pump down from atmosphere.

4. HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS
4.1 Modifications as necessary to existing furnace 
4.2 Vacuum system upgrades including Dry Vacuum Pump, Particle Trap, etc.
4.3 Complete set of quartzware including wafer carriers for 4” and 6” processing.
4.4 Gas Panel with Corrosive/Toxic Gas MFCs for dopant source gases and SiH4 with MFC purge capability.
4.5 Dopant Source Gas Cabinet installed inside of existing furnace cabinet.
4.6 Must demonstrate solid prior experience in welding coaxial SS tubing for use with extremely toxic gases.

5. TECHNICAL SUPPORT is required including installation, as well as process development of P and N doped Polysilicon processes at various doping concentrations on 6” Si wafers.

6. OPERATING SOFTWARE: If the furnace control system is replaced as part of this upgrade, PC based software for recipe management and data logging is required.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice. 

Companies that manufacture these types of systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to carol.wood@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. 

The report should include achievable specifications, demonstrate dopant and deposition capability on Si samples, demonstrate prior systems that are currently installed and operating in multi-user type facilities, and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 

1. Name and business size of the company that manufactures the system for which specifications are provided; 
2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the systems, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address); 
3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such processes; 
4. Indication of whether each system (including installation) for which specifications are sent to carol.wood@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s);
 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.

All documentation must be sent to Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.  E-mail address:  CAROL.WOOD@NIST.GOV.

Submission must be received not later than 3:30 PM local time on March 15, 2010.

BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AGENCY
  Research and Interviews for “Beware False Choices” 

1.0	 Title  

This effort acquires research support, interviews, writing, publishing, and management for the book “Beware False Choices.”

2.0 Background

The Business Transformation Agency (BTA) is specifically responsible as a corporate level service organization for the Department of Defense (DoD), accountable for successful definition and execution of DoD-wide business improvement initiatives and system investments. The Agency operates under the authority, direction, and control of the Deputy Chief Management Office.

Mission
The mission of the BTA is to guide the transformation of business operations throughout the Department of Defense and to deliver Enterprise-level capabilities that align to warfighter needs. 

Vision
The BTA will be recognized as the champion for driving and accelerating improvements to business operations across the Department of Defense. We will serve as a magnet to attract talented, dedicated professionals, creating a model for transformation leadership across the federal government

Key mandates driving the transformation of the Department’s business processes include the President’s Management Agenda, the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) e-Gov Initiatives and the OSD Networks & Information (NII) Net-Centric Strategy.  An important priority of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2005 is the business transformation of the military.  This transformation initiative is a significant effort that will affect the business, data, applications, and technical infrastructure layers of the DoD enterprise.  

The objective of the BTA is to provide decision makers within the Department of Defense accurate, useful, reliable and timely financial data and management information.  The objective of the BTA is to attain improvement in system performance, standardization across DoD agencies, and the ability to sustain an unqualified audit opinion.  The BTA efforts will provide substantial improvements over data and information currently used by DoD Agencies in the execution of their fiduciary and management responsibilities

PROPOSAL ASSISTANCE:

Read Me First:  An overview of the MAS Program, this document attempts to help the vendor decide if a schedule contract is right for them and provides general information about contracting with the U.S. Government.  Do not submit with your proposal.

Read Me Second:  Contains a helpful proposal checklist, rejection guidelines, Schedule points of contact, and Environmental Attributes.  

Solicitation:  This document includes all contract clauses and should be downloaded for future reference.  It also includes Supplemental Instructions for preparing a proposal.  (Note that various choices exist due to the variety of products addressed by this schedule, notably FOB terms.  Please disregard clauses which do not reflect your commercial practices.)  Do not submit with your proposal.

Vendor Response Document:  A "subset" of the Solicitation Document, the Vendor Response Document addresses those clauses which require information from the offeror.  The first page provides instructions on how to submit an electronic offer, http://eoffer.gsa.gov, as well as the directions to submit a paper proposal.  The Vendor Response Document must be submitted with any proposal and the last page includes a list of other required items.  REQUIRED.

SF 1449:  This Standard Form will serve as the first page of any contract which may be awarded.  Due to the nature of schedules, not all blocks apply, so please complete blocks 12, 17 and 30 only. See the Solicitation document, Supplemental Instructions, for further information about this form.  REQUIRED.

Regulations Incorporated by Reference:  Here, you will find the full text of those clauses which are incorporated by reference in the Solicitation document.

Do not submit with your proposal.

Past Performance Evaluation (PPE):  Because a PPE, or Open Ratings Report, must be submitted with the proposal, here you will find instructions on how to order such a report.  Do not submit instructions with your proposal.

Small Business Subcontracting Plan:  This document addresses the work the vendor intends to subcontract to small businesses.  REQUIRED when applicable.

Proposal Price List Preparation:  There are no specific requirements for pricelists under this schedule.  This form reminds you that clauses I-FSS-594 and I-FSS-600 will apply after a contract has been awarded.  Do not submit a GSA price list with your proposal.  However, you are required to submit a Commercial Pricelist with your proposal.

Commercial Sales Practice Format (CSP-1):  When determining if the terms the vendor has offered the Government are fair & reasonable, this summary of the vendorâ€™s commercial practices will be evaluated.  REQUIRED.

Letter of Supply:  Here, you will find a template of the form required for non-manufacturers.  REQUIRED when applicable.

MAS Express Program:  This program was designed to streamline and accelerate the offer review process.  (For this office, it is estimated that a contract will be awarded less than 90 days after receipt of a proposal.)  This file includes the checklist required when submitting proposals to the MAS Express Program.  Any questions regarding this program should be directed to (312)886-8897.  Do not submit with your proposal.

Proposed Discounts:  Though this information may be addressed throughout a proposal, this spreadsheet serves as a summary and focal point.  REQUIRED.

Once again, we thank you for your questions regarding the MAS program.

PROPOSAL ASSISTANCE:
Read Me First:  An overview of the MAS Program, this document attempts to help the vendor decide if a schedule contract is right for them and provides general information about contracting with the U.S. Government.  Do not submit with your proposal.
Read Me Second:  Contains a helpful proposal checklist, rejection guidelines, Schedule points of contact, and Environmental Attributes.  
Solicitation:  This document includes all contract clauses and should be downloaded for future reference.  It also includes Supplemental Instructions for preparing a proposal.  (Note that various choices exist due to the variety of products addressed by this schedule, notably FOB terms.  Please disregard clauses which do not reflect your commercial practices.)  Do not submit with your proposal.
Vendor Response Document:  A "subset" of the Solicitation Document, the Vendor Response Document addresses those clauses which require information from the offeror.  The first page provides instructions on how to submit an electronic offer, http://eoffer.gsa.gov, as well as the directions to submit a paper proposal.  The Vendor Response Document must be submitted with any proposal and the last page includes a list of other required items.  REQUIRED.
SF 1449:  This Standard Form will serve as the first page of any contract which may be awarded.  Due to the nature of schedules, not all blocks apply, so please complete blocks 12, 17 and 30 only. See the Solicitation document, Supplemental Instructions, for further information about this form.  REQUIRED.
Regulations Incorporated by Reference:  Here, you will find the full text of those clauses which are incorporated by reference in the Solicitation document. (Of particular interest to many MAS 78 contractors is clause 52.225-5, Trade Agreements.  Be sure to consult this clause before offering a product which is not manufactured in the United States.)  Do not submit with your proposal.
Past Performance Evaluation (PPE):  Because a PPE, or Open Ratings Report, must be submitted with the proposal, here you will find instructions on how to order such a report.  Do not submit instructions with your proposal.
Small Business Subcontracting Plan:  This document addresses the work the vendor intends to subcontract to small businesses.  REQUIRED when applicable.
Proposal Price List Preparation:  There are no specific requirements for pricelists under this schedule.  This form reminds you that clauses I-FSS-594 and I-FSS-600 will apply after a contract has been awarded.  Do not submit a GSA price list with your proposal.  However, you are required to submit a Commercial Pricelist with your proposal.
Commercial Sales Practice Format (CSP-1):  When determining if the terms the vendor has offered the Government are fair & reasonable, this summary of the vendorâ€™s commercial practices will be evaluated.  REQUIRED.
Letter of Supply:  Here, you will find a template of the form required for non-manufacturers.  REQUIRED when applicable.
MAS Express Program:  This program was designed to streamline and accelerate the offer review process.  (For this office, it is estimated that a contract will be awarded less than 90 days after receipt of a proposal.)  This file includes the checklist required when submitting proposals to the MAS Express Program.  Any questions regarding this program should be directed to (312)886-8897.  Do not submit with your proposal.
Proposed Discounts:  Though this information may be addressed throughout a proposal, this spreadsheet serves as a summary and focal point.  REQUIRED.

<DESC>Description:

The U.S. Department of State (DoS) intends to conduct a competitive procurement for a contractor(s) to provide construction security monitoring services at overseas and domestic Department of State (DoS) construction sites and storage areas.  DoS requires Site Security Personnel (SSP) support services at various domestic and overseas facilities to detect unauthorized access to internal controlled areas, to deter the introduction of unauthorized materials to the site, and to surveil the activities of un-cleared construction workers to prevent the implantation of clandestine surveillance devices or systems into the structure being constructed or its surroundings.  Four types of SSP may be required: 1) Cleared American Guards (CAG), 2) Construction Surveillance Technicians (CST), 3) Team Leaders, and 4) Site Security Coordinators (SSC).  There is currently no known requirement for construction security monitoring services at any domestic locations.  However, if a domestic need for these services should arise, DoS may also acquire the necessary services under this contract through issuance of delivery/task orders, which will specify locations and will include any provision and/or instructions applicable to work within the United States.

DoS plans to award multiple Labor-Hour, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for base and (4) four one-year option years. The IDIQ awards will be made to the responsive offerors, whose proposals conform to the solicitation, and will offer the “Best Value” to the government, whereas technical factors are more important than cost.  One award will be set aside for small business should a small business be found capable.  To qualify as a small business under the NAICS code, 561612, the small business size is the average annual receipts of no more than $18.5M.

Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database prior to proposal submissions.  Offerors may obtain information on registration requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.  The Offeror is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.


Proposal Submissions:

The Request for Solicitation and its attached documents will be posted under Solicitation Number, SAQMMA10R0022, on or around January 21, 2010.  No paper copies will be mailed. Proposal submissions will be due no later than 3:00 PM, EST on March 8, 2010.

Questions (Q&A) period opens with the posting of the synopsis. Questions should be e-mailed to:  jonesta3@state.gov.  Questions should be received no later than COB (5:00 PM, EST) on February 3, 2010.  Responses to all submitted questions will posted as an Amendment in FedBizOPPS.com. DoS does not plan to hold a site visit/pre-proposal conference for prospective offerors.

Security Clearance Requirements:

Offerors must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Top Secret facility clearance (FCL), issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M.  All entities comprising a joint venture for this effort must already possess a TS FCL, as well as the joint venture.  Successful offerors shall assign only U.S. citizens who possess current final Top Secret personnel security clearances for performance as Site Security Personnel on this contract.  Certain domestic management personnel must possess DSS Secret personnel security clearances.

DOS will not sponsor any firm for a facility clearance or facility clearance upgrade from Secret to Top Secret for this solicitation due to time constraints.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.  A bidders DD Form 254 has been issued with this solicitation.
