The       approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical     data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or      knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate      source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification  procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having        jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item         requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is      flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined      adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the          source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been          solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that  an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

This brochure           identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's       experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you  have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being          evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which   forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to        provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous   submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be      considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a    source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or   approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to    meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue      based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>Solicitation Amendment 2 with answers to second set of questions is now posted.  The proposal due date of 7/10/07 remains unchanged.

The Department of State (DOS) has a current requirement for telecommunications cable system design, installation and testing services. We anticipate awarding four  IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contracts .  Each contract will have a 12-month base year plus four 12-month Options. The contract ceiling is $2M per contract over 5 years.  Estimated  performance start date is June 2007.

The delivery orders will usually be for testing installed telecommunications cables systems at US Embassies and other diplomatic posts around the world but may require design and installation of systems at overseas posts on an infrequent basis.  The offer must be able to provide a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) Archetect, A RCDD engineer and experienced Senior and Junior technicians.

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $11M.

In order to be considered for award of this contract, interested offerors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. At least two contracts will be awarded to firms currently possessing Interim or Final Top Secret FCLs, while firms with Final Secret FCLs may be selected for one or more additional awards.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm to obtain an Interim Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to the selected offeror.
Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Interim and Final Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.
