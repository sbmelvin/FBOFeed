In making this determination the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID, PLANS AND SPECS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.&nbsp; THE INVITATION FOR BID IS SCHEDULED TO BE POSTED ON OCTOBER 14, 2014.<br /><br /><br />PROJECT DETAILS: CA FTNP YOSE PRES 1(14) Yosemite N.P. Tunnel Preservation</strong>
<p>This project is located on Big Oak Flat Road (CA Route 120) within Yosemite National Park in Mariposa County, California. The project includes preventative maintenance work to Big Oak Flat Road Tunnels No. 1, 2 and 3. The project starts approximately 1 mile west of the intersection with El Portal Road in Yosemite Valley. The proposed work primarily consists of spot repair of damaged reinforced concrete tunnel lining, sealing leaking joints in tunnel liners, improving tunnel liner drainage to existing drainage channel along roadway, installing trench drains across roadway, coring 3 inch weep holes in existing concrete curb and removing and replacing damaged concrete roadway slabs.</p>
<p>Tunnel No. 1 is 371 feet long with a cross section of a 14.5 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, and an 18-inch thick reinforced concrete lining. Tunnel No. 2 is 227 feet long with a cross section of a 14.5 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, and an 18-inch thick reinforced concrete lining. Tunnel No. 3 is 2,087 feet long with a cross section of a 14 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, with a lining which varies from reinforced concrete to exposed rock with a thin layer of shotcrete.</p>
<p>The project is located in Yosemite Valley within the National Park which has high visitation and sensitive resources. The tunnels are on Big Oak Flat Road which has average daily traffic of approximately 1,500 vehicles. Construction caused traffic delays will be limited to 15 minutes during daytime work and 30 minutes during nighttime work with one lane closures allowed.</p>
<p>The project requires specialized, highly technical work within the tunnels while maintaining one lane of traffic at all times. Concrete spall repairs will require location of the actual extent of deteriorated or delaminated concrete by the contractor, including location of the existing reinforcing bars. Chemical grout injection repairs will require qualified personnel with documented previous experience. Acceptance of the grout injection repairs will be based on performance requirements for stopping leaks. All concrete pavement and spall repairs will be integrally colored to match existing treatments, and colored joint sealant will need to be provided to match adjacent sidewalks. All wash water from power washing operations will need to be contained and filtered before being discharged or disposed of.</p>
<p>This project will require approximately 12,000 LNFT of joint and crack sealing (tunnel liner), 91,000 SQFT of tunnel cleaning (power washing), 130 SQYD of reinforced concrete pavement (at tunnel portals), 900 SQFT of concrete pavement patch (within tunnels), 50 SQFT of concrete spall repairs (tunnel liner), and 100 LNFT of coring/pressure grouting (tunnel liner leak repairs). In addition the project will require approximately 800 LNFT of 6 inch underdrain pipe installation and 2 inlets within the tunnels, and 80 LNFT of trench drains just inside the portals.</p>
<p>This project is located in a challenging and highly sensitive location in Yosemite Valley within the National Park, and great attention to detail will be required in achieving customer satisfaction in areas of tunnel repairs, quality control, traffic control and timely completion of work.</p>
<p>Construction is anticipated from February to May 2015. The approximate range for this project is between $1 million and $3 million.</p>

<DESC>Pursuant to 13.106-1(b), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Telerik Inc. for the purchase of a renewal DevCraft Ultimate Enterprise Software License - Bronze Level. The software is used as a reporting tool, screen components, and Office document manipulation for FHWA's Office of Information Management. This software is proprietary and is only available for sale through Telerik Inc.
<p>Because of the nature of this license, FHWA would need to put in a lot of effort and it would not be cost effective for the Agency to procure a similar type of license through another company.</p>
<p>A purchase order, issued under FAR Part 13, is anticipated and the total estimated value is not to exceed $31,950. The anticipated award date is in January of 2015.</p>
<p>The intent of this notice is not to request competitive proposals, and any information received from interested parties will only be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement should be conducted.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is seeking qualified sources to perform a follow up to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. NHLBI anticipates the issuance of a request for proposals (NHLBI-CSB-WH-2016-02-CM) on or about January 21, 2015 titled WHI Clinical Coordinating Center.
<p>Background:<br />The NHLBI, Extramural Research Program, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences (DCVS), Women's Health Initiative Branch (WHI) supports clinical trials and observational studies to improve understanding of the causes and prevention of major diseases affecting the health of women. Current studies focus on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and fractures, in collaboration with other NIH Institutes: NCI, NIAMS, NIA, NINDS, and ORWH. The large multi-center observational epidemiology studies seek to identify risk markers for disease or better quantify known markers using questionnaire, clinical examination, and laboratory data. The large and long-term multi-center clinical trials test promising but unproven interventions such as hormone therapy, diet, and supplements to prevent major diseases and evaluate overall effects on health. The Branch has established an infrastructure to support the utilization of data and blood samples from the studies by the scientific community.<br /><br />I. BACKGROUND INFORMATION - WOMEN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE<br /><br />1992-2005: In 1991 Dr. Bernedine Healy obtained funding for the WHI to study the etiology and prevention of the major chronic diseases of postmenopausal women. The study enrolled 68,132 women age 50-79 years in an overlapping set of randomized controlled clinical trials and another 93,676 women in an observational study (total = 161,808). <br />&bull; The randomized trials examined the health benefits and risks of postmenopausal hormone therapy, low fat dietary pattern, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Together, these trials have made important contributions to understanding the value of commonly used prevention strategies. Findings from the trial of hormone therapy led to a turnaround in medical practice and decreases in rates of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The net societal value of the trial of estrogen plus progestin over the 10 years since its publication is estimated to be ~ $140 for every $1 invested by NIH/NHLBI.<br />&bull; The data from the observational study has been used for a large variety of epidemiologic studies and have proven invaluable to explain discrepancies between trial findings and observational studies. <br /><br />2005-2010: The first renewal continued follow up of outcomes in trial participants and increased study power for subgroups of observational study participants (N=115,407). <br /><br />2010-2015: The current second renewal period (N=93,558) has aims similar to those for the proposed third renewal period. Significant changes were introduced to enhance cost efficiency and to increase the value of the cohort for prevention research. Cost savings realized were applied to additional research and to mentoring young investigators. <br />&bull; The original 40 clinical centers were streamlined to 4 regional centers. The outcomes process was largely centralized to the CCC. Regional centers contact non-responders, collect medical records, and participate in study management, scientific leadership, and mentoring. <br />&bull; Outcomes adjudication was scaled back to 22,283 participants in the Medical Records Cohort (MRC). The MRC comprises all consenting African American and Hispanic women and/or women previously enrolled in the hormone trials. The remaining 71,245 women in the Self-Report Cohort (SRC) are followed at much reduced cost through self-report, CMS, and NDI data queries.<br />&bull; The Long Life Study (LLS) is a subset of the MRC and comprises 7875 women age 63-97 years who were examined at home. <br />&bull; WHI has demonstrated utility of CMS data with positive predictive values of 86-95% for a range of cardiovascular outcomes when compared with adjudicated outcomes. <br />&bull; Two grant proposals for large, simple, low-risk prevention trials have been submitted for funding; one has been funded by private industry. <br />&bull; By virtue of its large size, the WHI program contributes disproportionately to consortium efforts and to public datasets. <br />&bull; NHLBI funded 3 BAAs to enhance the scientific value of the resource by exploring the relationships of genetic variations, methylation, gene expression and regulation, telomere biology, and metabolomics to coronary risk factors and to clinical coronary disease. Overlap between subjects will allow for an initial exploration of systems biology in relation to coronary disease. <br /><br />The third renewal (2016-2021) supports the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) core operations and the follow up of clinical events. The objectives are to:<br /><br />&bull; Expand knowledge about the determinants of cardiovascular disease in older women (and conversely determinants of successful aging with absence of cardiovascular disease);<br />&bull; Expand the study as a scientific resource for the research community;<br />&bull; Mentor young investigators;<br />&bull; Facilitate a new generation of large simple prevention trials.<br /><br />The current structure consisting of a Clinical Coordinating Center, four Regional Centers, and committee/scientific interest groups shall be maintained.</p>
<p>Coordinating Center Core Functions: These functions relate to maintaining and updating the data and biologic specimens as well, as the continuing follow-up of outcomes in ~85,000 participants. The Core functions of the Coordinating Centers are: <br /><br />&bull; Coordinate data collection for this large and complex study; maintain investigator, public, and study participant websites and documentation/data resources; <br />&bull; Make data and biologic specimens available to the research community; <br />&bull; Provide data and analytic support for paper proposals approved by the Publications and Presentations Committee; <br />&bull; Provide data and basic support for proposed ancillary studies and consortium studies; &bull; Deposit curated data into BioLINCC and dbGAP at the required intervals; <br />&bull; Update study files with clinical outcome, laboratory, and ancillary study data; <br />&bull; Provide support for administrative functions such as committee meetings and conference calls; <br />&bull; Provide annual study updates to Steering Committee, NHLBI, and Observational Studies Monitoring Board (OSMB).</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The requirement will cover 60 months and a "Cost-Reimbursement-Completion" type contract is being considered. The ultimate contract type and funding mechanism will be determined by the NHLBI, based on what fits the project's goals and the available funding. The RFP will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS website at www.fbo.gov. Prospective Offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and any/all attachments. The Offeror is responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps Web page for the release of the solicitation and any amendments. The RFP will be available from the FedBizOpps on or about January 21, 2015.</p>

The development of the ADS-B Out system will include upgrading the Integrated Avionics Computers (IACs) Global Positioning System (GPS) card assembly with a new Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS)/Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) GPS card, replacement of the Mode S Transponder, replacement of the GPS antenna, and upgrade to the T-6B Ground Based Training System (GBTS) IACs. The upgrade will include software modifications to the Flight Management System (FMS) to integrate the avionics components into the T-6B/T-6D Integrated Avionics System (IAS) and meet FAA Supplemental Type Certification. The contract will also cover the procurement of 252 T-6B (USN) and 4 T-6D (USA) aircraft modification kits, support and ground training equipment, spares and technical data affected by the engineering change. The prospective contract covers FY 2015 through 2019 and will consist of a cost reimbursable base period with two (2) firm fixed price production lots. A solicitation is not available at this time. Inquiries concerning this synopsis should be submitted IN WRITING via electronic mail to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Meghan E.

These services are an increasingly important component of VHA's integrated health care delivery system. VHA purchases skilled and unskilled services to enhance or build a comprehensive array of resources necessary to address the short term or long term care needs of enrolled veterans.

<DESC><br />SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is operated by Stanford University for the Department of Energy. As a management and operating contractor, subcontracts awarded by the Laboratory are not Federal procurements, and are not directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may affect our DOE approved purchasing system, as required by statute, regulation, or contract terms and conditions.<br /><br />Sources sought for Brand name or equal to:<br /><br />1.) Andor Part # DH320T-25F-03, Scientific camera = Qty 1<br /><br />2.) Andor Part # SOLIS (T), Software for Time-resolved solutions = Qty 1<br /><br />3.) Andor Part #: ANDOR-SDK-CCD, Software library for custom software development = Qty 1<br /><br />SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:<br /><br />1.) The total detector area needs to be at least 1" x 1/4" in order to obtain spectographs from the spectrometer (Andor Shamrock 193i)<br /><br />2.) Precision of gating window in time should be better than 1 microsecond. The model proposed provides a precision of 2 nanosecond. <br /><br />3.) Singal to noise ratio (SNR) as high as possible. The sensitivity of the proposed ICCD camera is about 200 counts/photoelectron at its maximum gain, while the average quantum efficiency is about 0.1 over the spectral range of interest (400-800nm). It corresponds to a signal response of 20 counts/photon. Wiht&nbsp;the maximum gain setting, the RMS noise is lower than 3 counts. As a result, it gives sufficient SNR to detect single photon evens on each pixel.

In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.  <br>  <br> 3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.

In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.  <br>  <br> 6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued for maximizing competition.  Should anything in the requirement be construed as limiting competition, please feel free to contact the MICC Special Competition Advocate (SCA) at dean.m.carsello.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> This synopsis is not a request for proposal. It is a market research tool being used to determine procurement strategy.  Appropriate procurement strategy will be determined after consideration of industry response to this sources sought synopsis. The Government is not obligated to, and will not, pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. <br>  <br> The Government is seeking responses to this sources sought synopsis from all interested businesses capable of providing the requirement.  Small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business, etc.) are highly encouraged to identify capabilities in meeting the requirements at fair market prices.   <br>  <br> For any acquisition set-aside for small business, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply and will require the prime contractor to self-perform at least 50 percent of the labor with its own employees. Prime contractors cannot sub-contract the entire effort.  Again, this applies only to small business set-asides. <br>  <br> This is a follow on contract for support services for the US Army Force Management Support Agency (USAFMSA).  The scope of this contract is to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision, and other items necessary to provide technical and analytical support services in support of the USAFMSA mission.  Support includes data collection, data analysis, data management, document integration, document integrator cross-training, organizational analysis, and other supporting functions.  The base period of performance is 1 August 2015 through 31 July 2016, with two one-year option periods. <br>  <br> USAFMSA, a field operating agency of HQDA G-3/5/7, is a unique and highly-specialized Army resource.  USAFMSA develops, maintains and distributes the Army's organizational requirements and authorization documents and data:  Tables of Organization and Equipment (TOE), Modified Tables of Organization and Equipment (MTOE), Tables of Distribution and Allowance (TDA), Basis of Issue Plans (BOIP) and Joint and Common Tables of Allowance (JTA/CTA).  The Agency maintains the Army's documentation data production and distribution systems; this includes FMSWeb which provides user-friendly, web-based access to force structure documents.   <br>  <br> All MTOEs and TDAs are synchronized with HQDA G-37/FMP's Structure and Manpower Allocation System (SAMAS), enabling complete and accurate accounting for all Army force structure.

<p>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 76,000 students in seven states, twelve foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The number of students varies based on the deployment of military troops worldwide. DoDEA's curriculum, resources, and student achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) seeks to obtain information from interested parties, including the vendor community, about potential opportunities to acquire a commercial off the shelf (COTS) legal-specific software for its Office of General Counsel (OGC).</p>
<p>DoDEA's OGC is contemplating an effort to replace its current case management system with an "off-the-shelf" Case Management System. This software is required to allow the OGC organization to manage their legal cases and matters from inception to completion. This software will need to be a turn-key solution and may require modification from the vendor to implement. The vendor will provide installation assistance; administrator and end-user training; and additionally perform a data migration of cases from DoDEA's current case management system. Additional announcements may be posted to accommodate further market research activities.</p>
<p><strong>Demonstration and Instructions for Interested Parties<br /><br /></strong>The Government plans to host vendor demonstrations during the week of 9 February 2015 DoDEA's Headquarters located in Alexandria, VA. Vendors are requested to provide an overview briefing and product demonstration which addresses the topics outlined in the Draft Statement of Work and includes end users and representatives from the requirement community. All proprietary information must be clearly marked IAW FAR Part 15. A summary of the session structure will be provided to each qualified applicant. A completed application is required to be considered for vendor participation. There is no application fee; however, all costs incurred in responding to this announcement will be solely the responsibility of each individual vendor. Facilities with projection capability will be used; all other materials to include computers, software, and wireless internet must be provided by each individual vendor. Vendors interested in participating should provide a completed application form in accordance with the guidelines outlined to Stesnie Ridley at stesnie.ridley@hq.dodea.edu no later than 4:30pm Eastern Standard time on 13 January 2015. Any questions to be addressed must be submitted to stesnie.ridley@hq.dodea.edu prior to closing of application. Vendors who do not participate in this Demonstration will not be excluded from any resulting solicitation.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the vendor application package, qualified applicants will receive an invitation to participate with detailed instructions. Demonstrations will be conducted in a one-on-one environment to ensure protection of any proprietary information. A Contracting Officer and Legal Counsel will be present during all demonstrations to ensure procurement integrity and equal treatment of all parties in accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304). Information or term and conditions for any future contracting vehicle(s) will not be discussed.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a solicitation and issued solely for market research and planning purposes. It does not constitute a RFP or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This invitation does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Participation is not mandatory, required or a prerequisite for any future procurement activities. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. You are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred or associated with this invitation. All costs associated with this invitation will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>

<DESC>This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any further contract actions, i.e., solicitation and/ or contract. Respondents are advised that the United States Government (FHWA) will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP that may be issued. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S Government to form a binding contract.<br />The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) / Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting market research to determine if there are any small business concerns capable of performing the FHWA Office of Operations (FHWA Operations) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract activities, deliverables, and other tasks required by the IDIQ. Contractors will need to show the ability to perform the objectives identified herein, both individually and concurrently.<br />1 Scope<br />The contractor shall provide support to the U.S. DOT by working with the FHWA Operations on various contracted task orders as part of the office's IDIQ contract. The FHWA Operations is comprised of three Program Offices: 1) Office of Transportation Management, 2) Office of Transportation Operations, and 3) Office of Freight Management and Operations.
<p>The FHWA Operations invests in program areas that are focused on helping State and local transportation agencies both perform core traffic operations activities at a high level, while also moving toward implementation of more proactive solutions. These program areas include:</p>
<p>&bull; Accelerating Implementation of Operations &amp; ITS Technologies and Strategies<br />The goal of accelerating the implementation of operations &amp; integrated ITS technologies &amp; strategies is to ensure effective and successful development, implementation, and use of technologies &amp; strategies by transportation agencies in managing their transportation facilities. A major element of accelerating deployment is the active engagement of FHWA division offices in identifying workshops, peer exchanges, and other resources that have been and may be successful in implementing operations strategies in transportation agencies.</p>
<p>&bull; Operations and Freight Performance Measurement and Management<br />Performance measurement is the use of evidence to determine progress toward specific defined organizational objectives. This includes both quantitative evidence (e.g., travel time measurements) and qualitative evidence (e.g., customer satisfaction and customer perceptions). Operations performance programs measure progress toward meeting the objectives of transportation system management and operations. Although the specific objectives of management and operations activities vary among organizations, most relate to the overall goals of transportation mobility, productivity, and safety. The FHWA Office of Operations is leading numerous activities to advance the implementation and practice of operations performance measurement at the Federal, State, and local level. Freight-specific performance measures help to identify needed transportation improvements and monitor their effectiveness for goods movement, and they also serve as indicators of economic health and traffic congestion.</p>
<p>&bull; Organizing and Planning for Operations<br />To meet the challenge of reducing congestion and improving operations, transportation agencies require tools to evaluate their current organizational capabilities, and plans for when &amp; how to successfully implement process improvements. Evaluating capabilities and making essential improvements to traffic operations and business processes moves an agency closer to organizational excellence, enabling them to successfully plan and execute operations programs that effectively manage transportation and reduce congestion. Planning for operations was developed to promote multimodal planning practices that support 21st century transportation system management and operations. In order to link 21st Century operational services into the transportation planning and programming process, transportation planners and operators should have a common understanding of the mobility, safety, and efficiency benefits of linking planning and operations.</p>
<p>Planning for Operations includes three important aspects:<br />&bull; Regional transportation operations collaboration and coordination activity that facilitates Regional Transportation Systems Management and Operations,<br />&bull; Management and operations considerations within the context of the ongoing regional transportation planning and investment process, and <br />&bull; The opportunities for linkage between regional operations collaboration and regional planning.</p>
<p>Linking planning and operations is vital to improving transportation decisionmaking and the overall effectiveness of transportation systems. Coordination between planners and operators helps ensure that regional transportation investment decisions reflect full consideration of all available strategies and approaches to meet regional goals and objectives.</p>
<p>&bull; Traffic Analysis Tools<br />Through the FHWA Traffic Analysis Tools Program, our partners and customers will expand their use of analysis tools and innovative analysis approaches that consider a system-level approach and will enhance mobility. They will gain insight on recommended/best practices and lessons learned in operational analysis. They will gain a high level of confidence in utilizing the analysis tools for their local needs. The Traffic Analysis Tools Program attempts to strike a balance between efforts to develop new, improved tools in support of traffic operations analysis and efforts to facilitate the deployment and use of existing tools. FHWA has established two tracks under the Traffic Analysis Tools Program: the deployment track and the development track. The deployment track concentrates on the needs and concerns of the traffic analysis stakeholder community. The development track focuses on enhancing and developing models that are easier to use, more robust in their application, and more reliable in their results.</p>
<p>&bull; Traffic Control (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD))<br />The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, or MUTCD, defines the standards used by road managers nationwide to install and maintain traffic control devices on all public streets, highways, bikeways, and private roads open to public travel. The MUTCD is published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) under 23 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 655, Subpart F. The MUTCD, which has been administered by the FHWA since 1971, is a compilation of national standards for all traffic control devices, including road markings, highway signs, and traffic signals. It is updated periodically to accommodate the nation's changing transportation needs and address new safety technologies, traffic control tools and traffic management techniques.</p>
<p>&bull; Active Transportation and Demand Management<br />Active Transportation and Demand Management (ATDM) is the dynamic management, control, and influence of travel demand, traffic demand, and traffic flow of transportation facilities. Through the use of available tools and assets, traffic flow is managed and traveler behavior is influenced in real-time to achieve operational objectives, such as preventing or delaying breakdown conditions, improving safety, promoting sustainable travel modes, reducing emissions, or maximizing system efficiency. Through ATDM, regions attain the capability to monitor, control, and influence travel, traffic, and facility demand of the entire transportation system and over a traveler's entire trip chain. This notion of dynamically managing across the trip chain is the ultimate vision of ATDM. The ATDM program is intended to support agencies and regions considering moving towards an active management approach. Through customized workshops, tools, guidance documents, resources, and peer exchanges, the program can assist with technical support to implement ATDM strategies. Importantly, ATDM is not an exclusive program restricted to specific agencies. Every agency that is considering moving towards active and dynamic capabilities can benefit from the ATDM program's efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; Arterial Management / Traffic Signal Operations<br />Arterial roadways are a crucial link in the national transportation system that provides regional mobility and access to land use that is vital to our economy and quality of life. Arterials account for more than one million lane miles of roadway, connecting local and collector roads to the national highway systems. Over 3000 State and local agencies are responsible for the management and operation of the estimated 311,000 traffic signals that are spread across urban, suburban and rural communities throughout the United States. The objective of the Arterial Management Program is to advance management practices and operations strategies that promote the safe and efficient use of arterial roadway capacity to reduce congestion.</p>
<p>&bull; Congestion Pricing<br />Congestion pricing (or value pricing) is a way of harnessing the power of the market to reduce the waste associated with traffic congestion. Congestion pricing recognizes that trips have different values at different times and places and for different individuals. Faced with premium charges during periods of peak demand, road users are encouraged to eliminate lower-valued trips, take them at a different time, or choose alternative routes or transport modes where available. In cases where congestion pricing is applied to specific traffic lanes rather than to an entire highway facility, users have the option of choosing to pay to use congestion-free priced lanes or continue to travel on general purpose lanes without paying a toll. There is a consensus among economists that congestion pricing represents the single most viable and sustainable approach to reducing traffic congestion. The Congestion Pricing program provides information and resources to help equip State agencies and practitioners with an understanding and tools to implement congestion pricing projects and incorporate pricing into transportation planning.</p>
<p>&bull; Real-Time Transportation Information<br />Real-Time Transportation Information focuses on information for all sorts of travel on the nation's surface transportation networks - how the information is collected, how it's processed, how it's provided to consumers, and how it may be used by transportation system operators to improve travel for everyone. Additionally, real-time transportation system information is shared to improve the security of the surface transportation system, to address congestion problems, to support improved response to weather events and surface transportation incidents, and to facilitate national &amp; regional traveler information.</p>
<p>&bull; Road Weather Management<br />Adverse weather conditions have a major impact on the safety and operation of our Nation's roads, from signalized arterials to Interstate highways. Weather affects driver behavior, vehicle performance, pavement friction, and roadway infrastructure. Weather events and their impacts on roads can be viewed as predictable, non-recurring incidents that affect safety, mobility and productivity. The Road Weather Management Program, within the FHWA Office of Operations, seeks to better understand the impacts of weather on roadways, and promote strategies and tools to mitigate those impacts. Envisioned is a system that provides "Anytime, Anywhere Road Weather Information" for road users and road operating agencies, as well as a robust, competitive market for road weather services.</p>
<p>&bull; Traffic Incident and Events Management<br />Traffic Incident Management (TIM) consists of a planned and coordinated multi-disciplinary process to detect, respond to, and clear traffic incidents so that traffic flow may be restored as safely and quickly as possible. Effective TIM reduces the duration and impacts of traffic incidents and improves the safety of motorists, crash victims and emergency responders. The TIM Program of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is part of a larger all-hazards program called Emergency Transportation Operations (ETO). Effective TIM is a coordinated process that involves a number of public and private sector partners, including: Law Enforcement, Fire and Rescue, Emergency Medical Services, Transportation, Public Safety Communications, Emergency Management, Towing and Recovery, Hazardous Materials Contractors, and Traffic Information Media.</p>
<p>&bull; Work Zone Mobility and Safety<br />The FHWA Work Zone Management Program is working to "make work zones work better" by providing transportation practitioners with high-quality products, tools, and information that can be of value in planning, designing, and implementing safer, more efficient, and less congested work zones. These resources include:<br />&bull; Comprehensive information and guidance for implementing the Work Zone Safety and Mobility Rule (23 CFR 630 Subpart J).<br />&bull; Peer-to-Peer Program that provides State and Local transportation agencies easy access to knowledgeable peers across a range of work zone issues, at no cost to these agencies.<br />&bull; Work zone training courses, to help practitioners plan, design, and implement safe and effective work zones.<br />&bull; Publications and studies on a variety of work zone topics, including work zone ITS, traffic analysis tools for work zones, contracting methods, construction strategies, public information and outreach for work zones, and others.</p>
<p>&bull; Commercial Vehicle Size and Weight</p>
<p>The Freight Office, in coordination with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) oversees the U.S. DOT's commercial vehicle size and weight activities. The Freight Office ensures the federal regulations governing commercial vehicle size and weight are appropriately enforced by the states, primarily through making sure each state has a commercial vehicle size and weight program. The office also works to implement initiatives that promote improved oversize commercial vehicle movements, such as Pilot Car Escort Vehicle training workshops.</p>
<p>&bull; Freight Data and Analysis</p>
<p>The Freight Office conducts much of the freight transportation data analysis conducted by the U.S. DOT. The analysis includes the creation and maintenance of the Freight Analysis Framework (FAF), which spatially maps freight transportation flows within the U.S. and entering the U.S. It also includes analysis on freight transportation performance measures, to evaluate freight flow efficiency on the U.S. transportation network. Finally, the Freight Office examines commercial truck parking data, and works with public and private sector providers to improve truck parking information availability.</p>
<p>&bull; Freight Operations and Technology</p>
<p>The Freight Office conducts various activities that work to enhance freight transportation efficiency through improved transportation operations. These activities include the implementation and promotion of the Freight Advanced Traveler Information System (FRATIS), which utilizes both private shipper and carrier freight shipment information and public sector traveler information to optimize freight flows and minimize the number of empty truck movements. They also include various technologies used to support commercial vehicle size and weight enforcement, including weigh-in-motion and the Pavement Damage Assessment Tool (PaveDAT).</p>
<p>&bull; Freight Professional Development</p>
<p>The Freight Office conducts various activities with its field offices and indirectly with state Departments of Transportation (DOT) and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) to improve public sector freight transportation planning. These activities include promoting and supporting the creation of state freight plans and state freight advisory committees as encouraged in MAP-21, overseeing the Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS) program, organizing and holding monthly webinars focused on current and on-going freight issues as part of the Talking Freight webinar series, creating, promoting, and teaching various courses designed to educate professionals about freight transportation needs and issues, and conducting state DOT and MPO program assessments. The activities also include conducting regular meetings with FHWA field office staff to discuss key freight-related legislation and state DOT and MPO freight planning needs, and maintaining the internal Freight Discipline SharePoint site to share important freight-related information within the agency. Finally, the Freight Professional Development program includes oversight of the highway and freight-focused portions of the U.S. DOT's high visibility Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) discretionary grant program.</p>
<p>Many, though not all, of the FHWA Operations activities are currently related to requirements in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), the current surface transportation reauthorization bill. MAP-21 contains many transportation-related provisions and requirements that are being led or carried out by the FHWA Operations. It is expected the contractor shall provide support to the FHWA Operations on MAP-21-related tasks, or when the successor bill to MAP-21 is enacted, the new, surface transportation reauthorization bill that replaces MAP-21.</p>
<p>In addition to the MAP-21 related provisions, the contractor shall provide support to the FHWA Operations on its on-going tasks not tied to the MAP-21 provisions. These tasks include providing staff technical support as needed for the various program areas specified above. The level of support required for these tasks will range from technical expertise that goes beyond the knowledge or abilities the FHWA Operations has within its staff.</p>
<p>The FHWA Operations programs /initiatives have cross-cutting technologies over other DOT Offices such as the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) ITS Joint Program Office. These technologies help to advance intelligent transportation systems by performing comprehensive transportation statistics research, analysis and reporting; and providing education and training in transportation and transportation-related fields.</p>

<RESPDATE>102014
<CONTACT>Mark Caban, Phone 303-497-6875, Fax 303-497-3163, Email mark.caban@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), on a sole source basis with Alabama Educational Television Commission (AETC) a non-profit entity, in accordance with the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Using FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures, the Government intends to negotiate a contract with AETC, for the purchase of preventative, unscheduled maintenance services and tower space for the NOAA's National Weather Radio (NOAA/NWR) All Hazards System transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at nine (9) AETC owned and operated sites located in Alabama in Anniston, Demopolis, Dozier, Florence, Huntsville, Louisville, Mobile, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa. The maintenance shall ensure the quality of NWR broadcasts and the issuance of warnings to the listening public within the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Radio Frequency Authorization (RFA) specifications and Department of Homeland Security requirements for each station. The National Weather Service (NWS) is mandated by the Federal Response Plan to provide uninterrupted Emergency Alert System (EAS) broadcast transmissions 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year.
<p>The sole source determination is based on AETC's unique ability to provide maintenance of NWR transmitter systems on a 24-hour, 7 day-a-week basis due to their unlimited access to the tower and transmitter equipment. This unlimited access is required in order to implement routine and unscheduled emergency maintenance as necessary to maintain uninterrupted service to the public. The AETC towers have accessibility restrictions in regards to Homeland Security. Their FCC license for broadcast television systems mandates the sites remain secure and therefore AETC does not allow other vendors unlimited access to them. Maintenance of NWR transmitter systems require 24-hour access to the tower and transmitter equipment in order to implement routine and unscheduled emergency maintenance as necessary to maintain uninterrupted service to the public. In addition, all AETC maintenance personnel that perform routine and corrective maintenance on the NWR transmitter system have appropriate technical qualifications, training, and experience to perform the required work on the NWS high power radio frequency (RF) VHF FM transmitter systems. AETC technical representatives are equipped with a full complement of NWR test equipment that is calibrated according to NWS specifications to assure accurateness in all NWR measurements. All maintenance personnel must meet NWS qualifications by appropriate schooling in electronics and associated theory, and specific training provided by the Government in the maintenance of its NWR transmitter equipment. No other sources appear to be technically capable of maintaining the NWR equipment at the subject Alabama sites. It must therefore be concluded that the only source capable of maintaining the NWR equipment is the AETC.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract will be for a period of 60 months which includes a base year, and four (4) one-year option periods. This requirement is a follow-on contracts numbers RA-133W-10-CN-0006 and RA-133W-10-CN-0006 with AETC. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 811213 Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance and the small business size standard is $11.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may provide written notification to the Contract Specialist requesting a copy of the solicitation and all proposals received within twenty seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Mark E. Caban, marke.caban@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the sam.gov.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number N6889815RCBG817. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, SC 29404 intends to award a sole source contract for specific training at Joint Base Charleston - Naval Weapons Station.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to The Bob Pike Group, 14530 Martin Drive Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (15) (16) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b) (ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628th Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC 29404.</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) Description of Supplies/Services: Training for 20 Naval Power Training Unit personnel</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: Naval Power Training Unit at Joint Base Charleston has already utilized Bob Pike Group "Training the Trainer Boot Camp" previously and employed their methods and techniques into our training infrastructure. The Bob Pike Group owns limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights and processes which other vendors do not have access to.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previous purchases of similar services.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A search using GSA.gov and SBA.gov did not yield any sources capable of providing this requirement.</p>
<p>(9) Interested Sources: In a search for companies under NAICS code 611430 and in open market, found similar companies but none could provide the requirement the customer is looking for.</p>
<p>(10) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />We are currently in the process of writing a performance work statement that will be competed and result in a 5 year requirement type contract..</p>
<p>(11) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Address questions to A1C David Rios, Contract Specialist, at (843) 963-7466, email david.rios_chinas.1@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), intends to issue a sole source purchase order with RainDance Technologies, Inc., for the purchase of Purchase of RainDrop<sup>TM</sup> Digital System, in support of the evaluation for new detection methods for high consequence plant pathogens.<br /><br />The RainDrop<sup>TM</sup> Digital System from RainDance Technologies Inc is the only digital PCR system on the market that can be used, in conjunction with RainDrop 96 Sample Consumable kit, for detection of high consequence of plant pathogens such as HLB. The RainDrop<sup>TM</sup> Digital PCR System surpasses all existing technologies and establishes a new performance standard in sensitivity, quantitation, and multiplexing. The RainDrop Digital System includes both RainDrop Source instrument (Creates and collects up to 10 million picodroplets per lane) and RainDrop Sense instrument (Identifies and counts each picodroplet following PCR amplification) with dedicated control computer and instrument control software. This novel approach increases sensitivity by generating between 1 million and 10 million pico-liter sized droplets per lane, which is a 500 -10,000x improvement over existing method~. Since each droplet encapsulates a single molecule, researchers can quickly determine the absolute number of droplets containing specific target DNA. The system could offer superior sensitivity to detect 1 mutant among 250,000 wild-type molecules with a lower limit of detection of 1 in more than 1,000,000. It has unprecedented multiplexing to conduct up to 10 tests on the same sample using the single molecule multi-color detection technique. In addition, the closed-tube design could ensure the highest quality data by eliminating contamination or carryover.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for equipment for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Simplified procurement procedures will be used as well as commercial item acquisition procedures per FAR 12. For additional information please contact Latisha Hollman at (919) 855-7003 or latisha.a.hollman@aphis.usda.gov.<br /><br />

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Logistics Supply Center, and Silver Spring, MD intend to award a purchase order to replenish logistics spares for the ASOS All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge (AWPAG).The U. S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Eastern Acquisition Division-Kansas City, (EAD-KC), intends to solicit for purchase of 50 All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge (AWPAG) Ring Heater controller Boards. NSN: 5998-01-520-7205.<br />This is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS) to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. This acquisition is proposed to be sole source to C.C. Lynch and Associates, Inc. as the only known qualified source of this part due to the proprietary nature of the design. All spares for this system are required to be identical to the item which was provided with the original equipment. It is not possible to substitute for this item; any logistical spares must be form, fit, and function identical to the original equipment item. C.C. Lynch and Associates considers this item as proprietary and so is the only known source of supply. The original equipment was subjected to a stringent qualification test regime which included operational testing, field testing, and environmental qualification testing. Acceptance of any item other than the original equipment would require that testing be completely reaccomplished. This is not acceptable, as it would require significant funding and time to accomplish and would result in fielded AWPAG systems being unavailable during the period. For this reason, only C.C. Lynch and Associates part number P/N 70.010.105.3.2 are deemed acceptable at this time.<br />The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items. The NAICS code for this action is 334519. The NWS special packaging/marking requirement will be applicable. Firms, who believe they can provide this supply, must furnish detailed information that demonstrates their experience and capability to provide the services, and satisfy the Government's needs. In addition shall include name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this type of supply previously. Interested parties must respond within (7) seven calendar days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the Government intends to issue Purchase Order to C.C. Lynch &amp; Associates, Inc. All contractors doing business with the Government must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered with SAM. For more information and to register with the SAM, please access the following website: http://www.sam.gov/.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Description of Federal Prison Industries: Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), which operates under the trade name UNICOR, is a wholly-owned Government Corporation within the Department of Justice, under the Federal Prison system. The Corporation was created by Congress in 1934, and provides employment, education, and training opportunities to inmates under federal custody. FPI operates more than 100 factories at approximately 70 locations. FPI's product lines are extensive, producing products and services in over 80 different Federal Supply Classes for sale to Federal agencies. Its business groups include Electronics, Office Furniture, Clothing &amp; Textiles, Industrial Products, Fleet &amp; Vehicular, Services, and Recycling. FPI is also a service provider, to include call centers, recycling center and distribution centers to the private sector in cases where the services would otherwise be performed outside of the U.S. FPI's mission is to employ and provide training to the greatest practicable number of inmates in federal correctional facilities. FPI employs a large number of inmates to ensure the safe and secure operation of such institutions. FPI must be market competitive in terms of price, quality and delivery. FPI operates in a self-sustaining manner while minimizing potential negative impact on private sector business and labor. The inmates benefit from industrial education, as well as earning wages. Employment of inmates by FPI substantially reduces recidivism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />FPI is interested in entering into business agreements with private sector firms to produce any of a variety of products and/or services using federal facilities and federal inmate labor. FPI requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing new products and/or service arrangements that would be sold to federal agencies and be produced by FPI under subcontract or otherwise in alliance with the successful offerors. FPI may also sell certain products and services to the private sector in cases where these products and/or services would otherwise be performed outside of the U.S., or where federal inmate labor is utilized under the conditions of the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP).</p>
<p>In addition, FPI is looking for individuals and companies ("offerors") to broker new business opportunities with new potential partners (whether private companies or government agencies), and may choose to award a business broker's fee to such individuals and companies when these opportunities are actualized. The type and amount of business broker's fee will depend on the role of the offeror in the new business partnership.</p>
<p>Strategic Business Development Program: Federal Prison Industries currently has business agreements with private sector firms to provide products and services to the Federal Government, as well as services to the private sector in cases where the services would otherwise be performed outside of the U.S. For some business agreements, FPI provides fully equipped and staffed factories and manufactures products and provides services as turn-key operations for its private sector partners. For other agreements, FPI simply provides inmate labor and the physical factory space for industrial operations or service. For a more detailed description of FPI and its operations, please visit http://www.unicor.gov/fpi_contracting/.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: FPI reserves the right to accept or reject proposals received.

"Qualification requirement," as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.</p>
<p>(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<p>Name___________________________________________</p>
<p>Address__________________________________________</p>
<p>(c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant information noted below should be provided. <br />Offeror's Name _____________________________________ <br />Manufacturer's Name______ __________________________ <br />Source's Name _____________________________________ <br />Item Name ________________________________________ <br />Service Identification ________________________________ <br />Test Number _______________________________________<br />(to the extent known) <br />(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.</p>
<p>(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.</p>
<p>(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.] if QPL</p>

(If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.) <BR> <BR>__ (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. __ (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200046 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-78 effective 26 December 2014 which incorporates FAC 2005-79 effective 15 December, 2014.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Airbus Group (Cage Code F5442) and Bureau Normalisation Aeronautiqueespace (F0111). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET "REQUIREMENTS-HSCG38-15-Q-200046" FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.</p>
<p>Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) H-65 aircraft.</p>

Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Technical evaluation will be based on the Offeror's certification that it is a Manufacturer Authorized Partner and that it has the certification/ specialization level required by the manufacturer to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with the applicable manufacturer certification/ specialization requirements. Past Performance will be verified by checking the Offeror's information on Government past performance websites (i.e. PPIRS) and by checking the Offeror's status on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). Offerors are reminded that the Government reserves the right to obtain past performance information from any source available. Offerors will be given the opportunity to respond to any negative past performance information received.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of all interested offerors to review this site frequently for any updates/ amendments that may occur during the solicitation process. The posting of this requirement does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this procurement/ solicitation either before or after the solicitation closing date, with no obligation to the offeror by the Government. The Government will issue a contract to the responsible, responsive offeror, with acceptable past performance, submitting the lowest price. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for contract award. For registration, go to www.sam.gov and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Term is mandatory for lodging and hotel requirements. 
This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.

All proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel shall provide the following: (1) Valid business insurance certificate. (2) Hotel agreement verified, and countersigned by both parties and the authorized agent of the participating hotel (hotel letterhead). 
(Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Accepltability and price Technical acceptability is significantly more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerors specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR> <BR>QUESTION FROM AN INTERESTED SELLER: Does the group require a hotel with "Interior Corridors" only.
ANSWER: Per PWS 2.3 GUEST ROOMS, preferably in the inner part of the hotel not toward the lobby.  Interior Corridors are preferred for security concerns. <BR> <BR>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <BR> <BR>(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

This does not require the Contractor to create or maintain any record that the Contractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to a provision of law.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS&nbsp;<br /><br />The evaluation factors below are not formal source selection procedures.</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award: Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA), responsive and responsible Offeror. This is a competitive LPTA selection in which technical acceptability is considered the most important factor. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offers, with satisfactory past performance, shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The Government intends to select ONE contractor for award of this effort. For the purpose of award, the government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 2 - Past Performance (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 3 - Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Acceptability<br />In order to be determined technically acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate capability to meet the following standards:</p>
<p>1. The offeror shall submit their Technical Capability Information as Volume I, and be no more than 3 pages.</p>
<p>2. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach to accomplish assembly in accordance with MIL-A-8625 and MIL-STD-130 as required by the technical drawings.</p>
<p>3. The offeror shall demonstrate technical knowledge by providing the technical approach, including tools and equipment required to perform assembly of the ATDC Frames. Specifically, the offeror shall provide the following information: Tool Name, Manufacturer, Part Number, and a brief description of how the tool will be used during the assembly process. The technical approach will be evaluated for:</p>
<p>a. Compliance with Drawing 8554696.<br />b. Compliance with the requirements in the SOW.<br />c. Compliance with delivery schedule as detailed in the SOW.</p>
<p>4. The offeror's technical proposal shall enable Government evaluating personnel to make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the proposal will meet the requirements of the Statement of Work. Each technical proposal shall be specific, detailed, and complete as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the prospective contractor has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the Statement of Work requirements. Proposals that paraphrase the specifications / Statement of Work or attest that "standard procedures will be employed" are inadequate to demonstrate how the proposal complies with the Statement of Work and will render the proposal "Unacceptable".</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors must not have unsatisfactory past performance. The Offeror shall not submit performance data for this factor. The government may seek relevant performance information on all responsive and otherwise Technically Acceptable Offerors through sources such as DCMA, CPARS, FAPIIS, or PPIRS; or other government databases and other available sources. The government shall not be limited in its search for performance data. When past performance is evaluated, the outcome is satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory performance will disqualify an Offeror from award. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, the Offeror shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance; however, the offeror would be rated neutral. Satisfactory and Neutral are determined to be passing.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price Evaluation<br />The government shall conduct a price evaluation of all technically acceptable offers with satisfactory or neutral past performance.</p>
<p>b. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>c. Selection Decision:<br />The government shall select the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsive, and responsible offer for award.</p>
<p>All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation. For changes made after the closing date, only those Offerors that provide a quote will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.<br />To be eligible for award of a Government contract, contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). The link to the website is https://www.sam.gov.<br />No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed. Quotes must be submitted in portable document format (.pdf) by email to the Primary Point of Contact (POC) identified below. It is the responsibility of the Offeror to submit offers to the POC at NSWC PHD by the closing date of January 21, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>

<DESC>This notice is hereby extended to 2/2/18 9:00am Eastern Time.<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please note the additional inquiries and responses below:<br /></span></strong><br />USTDA has received inquiries as to whether airport layout plans will be provided for the 85 airports mentioned in footnote 2 under Task 7 of the Terms of Reference.  In response, not all of the 85 layout plans may be available.  In this light, it is suggested that rough order of magnitude cost estimates for the improvements be developed based on sample airports for each of the general airport classifications.<br /><br />USTDA has received inquiries regarding whether it would be acceptable for the same prime contractor/Offeror to submit two proposals.  In response, in the event that two proposals from the same prime contractor/Offeror are received, the latest submission will be the one opened during bid opening.
<p><br />USTDA has received inquiries as to whether the selected Offeror would be able to be involved in follow on work (i.e., provision of systems, components, engineering services, construction management services, etc.). In response, Offeror may participate in the bidding for the follow on work subject to compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries as to whether upon award, and prior to team deployment to the Philippines, the data that is to be supplied in Task 1 will be made available to the selected Offeror.  The answer is yes, the data may be made available upon award.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries regarding the number of project references for the Offeror and any subcontractors.  In response, proposals are expected to provide up to six (6) relevant and verifiable project references for the Offeror and up to six (6) relevant and verifiable project references for each subcontractor.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries as to the quantity of personnel that must be included in the proposal submittal; for instance, must all personnel to be engaged in the project be listed in the proposal, or just key technical and managerial personnel that will be engaged in the project.  In response, per section 3.3 of the RFP, the Offeror is expected to discuss how the project will be managed including the principal and key staff assignments for this Technical Assistance.  The Offeror is expected to provide a listing of personnel (including subcontractors) to be engaged in the project, including both U.S. and local subcontractors, with the following information for key staff:  position in the project; pertinent experience, curriculum vitae; other relevant information.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries regarding the predicted earliest possible start date for the Technical Assistance program.  In response, it is unclear what the start date may be due to a number of external factors.</p>
<p>USTDA is making this information available for the benefit of all prospective bidders. The response date for this RFP remains 4:00 PM local (Manila) time on January 14, 2015.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:  <br>  <br> The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research to determine the availability of medical countermeasures that mitigate the effects of multi-drug resistant bacterial infections by biological agents in DoD personnel.   <br>  <br> Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ALL or ANY of the requirements listed below. Respondents should provide whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. If candidates are interested in teaming with other sources, please include in your response authorization to release your company's name, area of interest, and POC information to be made available on a public website. All proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation for proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt. <br>  <br>  <br> Background:  <br> The JPdM Biological Defense Therapeutics (BDTx) Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCS) Joint Project Management Office focuses on the advanced development of adaptable platform technologies and broad-spectrum medical countermeasures (MCMs) to counter emerging, genetically engineered, or unknown threats. JPdM BDTX Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops therapeutics for Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) that cannot be mitigated by existing MCMs. <br>  <br> To ensure Warfighter capability-in the face of the continuing emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria and advancements in biotechnology that enable development of genetically engineered, drug resistant bacteria-there is a need to identify new classes of antibacterial compounds and new bacterial targets. Accordingly, the goal of the CMDR-B program is to develop long-term, broad-spectrum therapeutic solutions to defeat antibiotic resistant BWAs. <br>  <br> Objectives:  <br> The CMDR-B program is considering development of a therapeutic for antibacterial resistance mitigation with potential solutions including development of combinations of existing FDA-approved therapeutics that act synergistically to overcome antibacterial resistance; development of adjunctive molecules which interfere with antibiotic resistance mechanisms; and development of novel therapeutics (e.g., novel chemical entities) for which there is no known bacterial resistance. <br> Interested parties should fully describe their medical countermeasure (therapeutic) and provide all available information with respect to criteria A-M below. If an MCM candidate meets only some of the criteria, a portion of a criterion, or otherwise has capabilities not specifically called out by the criteria, JPdM BDTX still strongly encourages a response to this RFI so that a more complete understanding of the state-of-the-art may be obtained. MCMs developed by the commercial sector, academia, the United States Government, and international entities are acceptable. <br>  <br> A. Antimicrobial MCMs that either directly or indirectly prevent or treat disease caused by pathogenic bacteria (either gram positive or gram negative). MCMs should be either FDA-approved or currently in development and could include novel combinations of FDA-approved drugs. For this purpose, drugs can be defined as:  <br>   two or more antibiotics <br>   an antibiotic with a molecule that augments the activity of the antibiotic <br>   a novel single molecule  <br>  <br> The chemical entity for the MCM should be identified as well as its relationship to existing FDA-approved drugs, if applicable (e.g., fluoroquinolone, 4th generation cephalosporin). Only those MCMs that have completed Quantitative Technology Readiness Level (QTRL) 6 or higher for a Public Health Indication and demonstrated activity against a BWA targets are to be included (see Attachment 1 QTRLs). Accordingly, using Attachment 1 QTRLs definitions for level 6 TRL provided on page 5-6, specify the maturity of the MCM and discuss the TRL steps that have been completed. <br> B. MCM in vivo activity against all bacterial species for which data is available, and provide a brief summary of the approach of the analysis. <br> C. MCM activity (in vitro and/or in vivo) against one or more of the following biothreat agents: <br>  <br> a.	Francisella tularensis  <br> b.	Bacillus anthracis <br> c.	Brucella spp. <br> d.	Burkholderia mallei <br> e.	Burkholderia pseudomallei  <br> f.	Yersinia pestis <br>  <br> D. MCM effectiveness in disease models for aerosol and/or non-aerosol exposures (in vitro and/or in vivo) with endpoint used in the study for efficacy identified (e.g., increased survival rate and/or ability to stop/minimize/reverse the progression of signs and symptoms of infection, as compared with controls). <br> E. MCM mechanism of action: <br> 1. Host immune modulation or disruption of bacterial immune evasion mechanisms.  <br> 2. Disruption of bacterial life cycle. <br> 3. Disruption of common pathways of bacterial pathogenesis (through bacterial or host targets). <br> 4. Mitigation of resistance to current therapeutic options. <br> F. MCM utility as a post symptomatic treatment, with reported therapeutic window or post exposure prophylactic.  Drugs with an intended pretreatment indication may be reported, but MUST also show in vivo efficacy as a post-symptomatic treatment. <br> G. MCM potential utility against multi-drug resistant bacteria. <br> H. For adjunctive molecules, MCM ability and mode of action to abrogate a specific mechanism of antibiotic resistance. <br> I. Novelty of the compound class and unique nature with respect to any known mechanisms conferring resistance to the compound. <br> J. Novelty of the therapeutic target and unique nature with respect to any known mechanisms conferring resistance to the compound. <br> K. Route of administration. <br> L. Suitability as a platform technology adaptable to other MCM discovery applications (e.g., a chemical scaffold that is rapidly adaptable to multiple pathogenic threats and which could be tailored to generate a therapeutic solution for a new pathogenic threat once that threat has been characterized). Contractor should discuss the proposed mechanism for response to new threat (e.g. tailoring the platform). <br> M. Any associated intellectual property rights or patent coverage. <br>  <br> Submission Instructions: <br> All responses must be submitted electronically to jeremy.d.michaels.civ@mail.mil within fifteen (15) days of issuance of this RFI. Address any question regarding this RFI, in writing, to the above.  Submissions must: <br> (1)	Use Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF (text searchable format) using single-space, 12-point font and printable on 8.5 x 11 size white paper, with margins no less than 1 quote mark  at the top, bottom, and sides;  <br> (2)	Include technical and administrative points of contact, with names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses in the cover page; and  <br> (3)	 Not exceed ten single-sided pages in total (not including cover page and cover letter). Responses shall be organized to provide concise information to respond directly to the points given in the A-M criteria (as listed above) in the order shown. Respondents may include additional information, such as supporting test reports or pertinent journal articles as desired. However, the ten-page response shall stand-alone from the additional information, and shall describe the technology without reference to the additional information. The additional information, if any, shall be separately labeled from the response, and removable from the ten-page response without any loss of understanding to the ten-page response. Material that is advertisement only in nature is not desired. .  <br> The respondent must also provide their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, size and type of business (e.g. large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements. <br> The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this notice. Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security Classification markings. Any information provided to the U.S. Government in response to this sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and will not be used as a selection consideration factor in any U.S. Government contract competition. Should the U.S. Government elect to pursue the subject requirement, an official Request for Proposal will be released at a later date in accordance with FAR Part 5.  <br>  <br> Sources Sought Info: <br>  <br> This Sources Sought Notice allows qualified sources for this requirement to self-identify. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited.

<DESC>January 6, 2015 Update Includes Anticipated Schedule Corrections

Reclamation's Great Plains Regional Office intends to solicit proposals for the replacement of existing aerial copper control and communication cables and equipment between the Flatiron Powerplant, the Carter Lake Shaft House, the Flatiron Gatehouse, and the Flatiron Gauging Station.  The replacements shall be new fiber-optic, programmable logic controller (PLC) based systems with modern control hardware.  The place of performance is located approximately 12 miles southwest of Loveland, Colorado in Larimer County.

The principal components of the work to be performed include the following:
* Furnish all materials and perform work to replace the existing controls and copper control and communication cable between Carter Lake Shaft House (CLSH) and Flatiron Powerplant (FIPP). The existing copper control and communication cable will be removed and replaced with fiber optic cable. New programmable logic controller (PLC) with central processing unit (CPU) and gate controls will be installed at CLSH. A PLC remote input/output (I/O) rack will be installed at FIPP. The PLC will utilize this new fiber for communications between the main CPU chassis at CLSH and the remote I/O rack at FIPP. All equipment at CLSH will be AC powered.
* Furnish all materials and perform work to replace the existing controls and control and communication cable between FIPP and Flatiron Gate House (FIGH). A new PLC (with CPU) and gate controls will be installed at FIGH. Existing unused fiber cable between FIGH and FIPP will be terminated to patch panels. The PLC will utilize this fiber for communications between the main CPU chassis and the remote I/O rack at FIPP. All equipment at FIGH is AC powered.
* Furnish all materials and perform work to remove the existing control and communication cable between FIGH and Flatiron Gauging Station (FIGS), to install a new fiber cable between FIGH and FIGS, and replace the water elevation cabinet at FIGS. A new PLC remote I/O chassis will be installed at FIGS to communicate with the CPU at FIGH. All equipment at FIGS is AC powered.
* Furnish all materials and perform work for installing a new cabinet at FIPP that will contain all of the remote I/O for CLSH, FIGH, and FIGS. The new PLC discrete and analog I/O from these sites will be connected to the existing main FIPP control PLC. Equipment in the new cabinet will be 125 VDC powered.
* Furnish all materials and perform work for installing new control equipment in the main control room at FIPP that will remotely operate the controls for FIGH. Equipment will be 125 VDC powered.
* Furnish all materials and perform work for adding a manual transfer switch at FIGH for connection to a portable standby generator.
* Design and provide a cutover plan that minimizes potential FIPP outages due to work at the other sites.
* Provide detailed schematic drawings and layout drawings of the proposed system to be installed.
 
Pursuant to Part 12 and Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Reclamation intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or around FEBRUARY 23, 2015.  Reclamation intends to evaluate proposals submitted under the solicitation and select a source for award without discussions.  The Government will consider the following factors in evaluating proposals and making the source selection decision:

* Key Personnel
* Past Performance

The estimated price range of this acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000.  Reclamation anticipates issuing the RFP under the total small business set-aside program.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237130 and the associated Small Business Size Standard is $36.5 Million.

<p>Any offerors believing they can provide the required brand name IPG Photonics Corporation green fiber lasers with all specifications of the requirement described above may provide evidence for consideration.&nbsp; Evidence must support the offeror's claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency.&nbsp; Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted.&nbsp; A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Responses must be received NLT 1:00 pm Mountain Standard Time (MST) on&nbsp;20 January 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><strong>PROJECT DETAILS: CA FTNP YOSE PRES 1(14) Yosemite N.P. Tunnel Preservation</strong>
<p>This project is located on Big Oak Flat Road (CA Route 120) within Yosemite National Park in Mariposa County, California. The project includes preventative maintenance work to Big Oak Flat Road Tunnels No. 1, 2 and 3. The project starts approximately 1 mile west of the intersection with El Portal Road in Yosemite Valley. The proposed work primarily consists of spot repair of damaged reinforced concrete tunnel lining, sealing leaking joints in tunnel liners, improving tunnel liner drainage to existing drainage channel along roadway, installing trench drains across roadway, coring 3 inch weep holes in existing concrete curb and removing and replacing damaged concrete roadway slabs.</p>
<p>Tunnel No. 1 is 371 feet long with a cross section of a 14.5 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, and an 18-inch thick reinforced concrete lining. Tunnel No. 2 is 227 feet long with a cross section of a 14.5 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, and an 18-inch thick reinforced concrete lining. Tunnel No. 3 is 2,087 feet long with a cross section of a 14 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, with a lining which varies from reinforced concrete to exposed rock with a thin layer of shotcrete.</p>
<p>The project is located in Yosemite Valley within the National Park which has high visitation and sensitive resources. The tunnels are on Big Oak Flat Road which has average daily traffic of approximately 1,500 vehicles. Construction caused traffic delays will be limited to 15 minutes during daytime work and 30 minutes during nighttime work with one lane closures allowed.</p>
<p>The project requires specialized, highly technical work within the tunnels while maintaining one lane of traffic at all times. Concrete spall repairs will require location of the actual extent of deteriorated or delaminated concrete by the contractor, including location of the existing reinforcing bars. Chemical grout injection repairs will require qualified personnel with documented previous experience. Acceptance of the grout injection repairs will be based on performance requirements for stopping leaks. All concrete pavement and spall repairs will be integrally colored to match existing treatments, and colored joint sealant will need to be provided to match adjacent sidewalks. All wash water from power washing operations will need to be contained and filtered before being discharged or disposed of.</p>
<p>This project will require approximately 12,000 LNFT of joint and crack sealing (tunnel liner), 91,000 SQFT of tunnel cleaning (power washing), 130 SQYD of reinforced concrete pavement (at tunnel portals), 900 SQFT of concrete pavement patch (within tunnels), 50 SQFT of concrete spall repairs (tunnel liner), and 100 LNFT of coring/pressure grouting (tunnel liner leak repairs). In addition the project will require approximately 800 LNFT of 6 inch underdrain pipe installation and 2 inlets within the tunnels, and 80 LNFT of trench drains just inside the portals.</p>
<p>This project is located in a challenging and highly sensitive location in Yosemite Valley within the National Park, and great attention to detail will be required in achieving customer satisfaction in areas of tunnel repairs, quality control, traffic control and timely completion of work.</p>
<p>Construction is anticipated from February to May 2015. The approximate range for this project is between $1 million and $3 million.</p>

<RESPDATE>012015
<CONTACT>Mark Caban, Phone 303-497-6875, Fax 303-497-3163, Email mark.caban@noaa.gov
<DESC>This notice is updated to include that the State of Alabama has been providing this service for ten years. This Performance Work Statement and Draft Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been added to this Notice.<br /><br />This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), on a sole source basis with Alabama Educational Television Commission (AETC) a non-profit entity, in accordance with the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Using FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures, the Government intends to negotiate a contract with AETC, for the purchase of preventative, unscheduled maintenance services and tower space for the NOAA's National Weather Radio (NOAA/NWR) All Hazards System transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at nine (9) AETC owned and operated sites located in Alabama in Anniston, Demopolis, Dozier, Florence, Huntsville, Louisville, Mobile, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa. The maintenance shall ensure the quality of NWR broadcasts and the issuance of warnings to the listening public within the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Radio Frequency Authorization (RFA) specifications and Department of Homeland Security requirements for each station. The National Weather Service (NWS) is mandated by the Federal Response Plan to provide uninterrupted Emergency Alert System (EAS) broadcast transmissions 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year.
<p>The sole source determination is based on AETC's unique ability to provide maintenance of NWR transmitter systems on a 24-hour, 7 day-a-week basis due to their unlimited access to the tower and transmitter equipment. This unlimited access is required in order to implement routine and unscheduled emergency maintenance as necessary to maintain uninterrupted service to the public. The AETC towers have accessibility restrictions in regards to Homeland Security. Their FCC license for broadcast television systems mandates the sites remain secure and therefore AETC does not allow other vendors unlimited access to them. Maintenance of NWR transmitter systems require 24-hour access to the tower and transmitter equipment in order to implement routine and unscheduled emergency maintenance as necessary to maintain uninterrupted service to the public. In addition, all AETC maintenance personnel that perform routine and corrective maintenance on the NWR transmitter system have appropriate technical qualifications, training, and experience to perform the required work on the NWS high power radio frequency (RF) VHF FM transmitter systems. AETC technical representatives are equipped with a full complement of NWR test equipment that is calibrated according to NWS specifications to assure accurateness in all NWR measurements. All maintenance personnel must meet NWS qualifications by appropriate schooling in electronics and associated theory, and specific training provided by the Government in the maintenance of its NWR transmitter equipment. No other sources appear to be technically capable of maintaining the NWR equipment at the subject Alabama sites. It must therefore be concluded that the only source capable of maintaining the NWR equipment is the AETC.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract will be for a period of 60 months which includes a base year, and four (4) one-year option periods. This requirement is a follow-on contracts numbers RA-133W-10-CN-0006 and RA-133W-10-CN-0006 with AETC. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 811213 Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance and the small business size standard is $11.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may provide written notification to the Contract Specialist requesting a copy of the solicitation and all proposals received within twenty seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Mark E. Caban, marke.caban@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the sam.gov.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract to Transystems, 2400 Pershing St., Suite 400, Kansas City, MO, 64108. This sole source Service contract is required for historic preservation review and impact assessment of in-field construction modifications to project plans and specifications; consultation with approved parties and review of construction contract submittals to ensure compliance with previously approved historic preservation assessments; for work on infrastructure in New York City .  <br>    <br>  Under the previous task orders Transystems was tasked to review all engineering reports and design submittals (Preliminary Assessments, 10%, 30%, 60%, 90%) up to the 100% submittal for each construction element.  Transystems reviewed 16+ design submittals, provided an assessment of historic preservation impacts from proposed designs and provided modifications to limit such impacts.  Transystems attended all meetings with Project Delivery Team and with reviewing agency officials.  The project is now in the construction phase.  Design changes and in -field modifications to previously approved plans and specifications must be reviewed for potential historic preservation impacts.  Also required is review of qualifications for certain construction contract personnel as per historic preservation agreements and approval of material samples specified to minimize historic preservation impacts.   Transystems will provide rapid and critical support throughout the construction phase.  <br>    <br>  Transystems was previously approved to participate in the review process as per an agreement with Federal, State and Local agencies.  Transystems has become intimately familiar with the issues related to the historic preservation issues on this project.  To bring in a new firm at this stage would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government as the new firm has to review work that has been on-going since 2004.  Integrating a new firm at this stage in the project will bring unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  <br>    <br>  Transystems will not perform work for any other project or program under this specific contract action.  <br>    <br>  This is NOT a request for proposals or quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Firms intending to provide submittals must submit detailed information indicating their ability to meet the Government requirements. <br>  <br> Responses due by January 21, 2015 to brian.klug@usace.army.mil

<DESC>Pre Solicitation Notice for W912GB-15-R-0004    <br>      <br>   Project Title and Location: Integrated Training Area Management GIS Services Contract for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015    <br>      <br>   The United States (U.S.) Government is soliciting interest for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multi Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide training land management capability across the total Army.  The US Army recognizes that the execution of training to doctrinal standards under realistic combat conditions will affect the environment.  The ITAM Program is also an essential part of the Army's commitment to environmental stewardship.  ITAM establishes a systematic framework for decision-making and management of Army training lands.  This allows the Army to manage its land in an environmentally sound manner to ensure no net loss of training lands for accomplishing primary activities (training, testing, storage, etc,) or for impacting the overall training capability.  The effective integration of stewardship principles into training land and conservation management practices ensures that the Army's lands remain viable to support future training and mission requirements indefinitely.  It integrates elements of operational, environmental, master planning, and other programs to identify and assess land use alternatives.  The ITAM Program thus supports sound natural and cultural resource management practices to provide stewardship of land assets, while sustaining those assets to support training, testing, and other installation missions.  The ITAM program consists of four major elements:  (i) Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA, (ii) Training Requirements Integration (TRI), (iii) Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance (LRAM), (iv) Sustainable Range Awareness (SRA).     <br>   The Contractor shall support the aforementioned programs (depending upon the particular scope of the work contained in an individual Task Order) by conducting appropriate field surveys, field sampling, investigations, site visits, interviews, and literature searches; execute suitable studies; prepare satisfactory reports, prepare plans and specifications, perform on-going site monitoring, Geographic Information System support, imagery/drawings, cartographic mapping, and provide on-site support to assist in performing Sustainable Range Program (SRP) related tasks.  Any or all of the above may be required during the period of this contract.  Those work efforts described above may occur at any location described below.   <br>   There will be one (1) solicitation for the following geographical locations:  Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Slovenia.  Majority of the work is anticipated to be primarily in Germany.   <br>   Each project task order awarded under this contract shall normally be comprised of a number of pre-described and pre-packed tasks as described in each Task Order and the Unit Price Book.   <br>   The Award of this contract will be made on best value to the Government. Price and Technical factors will be considered.   <br>      <br>   a. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:    <br>   A base period of one (1) year and (3) three-year option periods.   <br>      <br>   b. MAXIMUM CONTRACT VALUE:    <br>   It is anticipated $2,375,000.00 annually for the base period and 3 option years, not-to-exceed $9,500,000 for the entire life of the contract.   <br>      <br>   c. MINIMUM GUARANTEE:    <br>   A single minimum guarantee amount of $5,000 covers the base period and any option period(s).    <br>      <br>   d. TASK ORDER LIMITATIONS:    <br>   The minimum task order is $2,500 and the maximum task order is $1,250,000 (reference clause 52.216-19).  On a case by case basis the Contracting Officer has the authority to issue task orders that may exceed the maximum task order limit.   <br>      <br>   A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to encourage early Contractor involvement. Potential offerors are encouraged to submit questions related to this notice or the draft SOW no later than Friday 09 January 2014 to Contract Specialist Ian McClary at Ian.R.McClary@usace.army.mil and Contracting Officer Frank Johnson at Frank.j.Johnson@usace.army.mil.  All documents including the solicitation and information about a potential site vistit will be be posted via the fedbizopps website at www.fbo.gov. Solicitation will be issued on or about Thursday 26 January 2015.   <br>      <br> *** We are unable to attach the draft Statement of Work to this notice and will not be able to provide it for review. The final Statement of Work will be released to industry once the solicitation is open for advertisement. We apologize for the inconvenience.*** <br>  <br>   Solicitation cancellation with no obligation to the Government-  quote mark Note to offerors: The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation, either before or after the proposal opening with no obligation to the offeror by the Government. quote mark    <br>

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
The Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center requires the services of a vascular surgeon to provide clinic coverage one day per week, Mondays from 0800-1630 at an estimated rate of $205.82 per hour. The contractor will also provide onsite coverage Monday-Friday 0800-1630 and 24/7 on call coverage once personnel become available. The period of performance for this requirement will be for a 6 month time frame. An Independent Government Cost Estimate has been completed.
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:
( ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): This requirement is urgent and compelling, as recruitment for staff and contracting for locum tenens services have been unsuccessful over numerous attempts.
