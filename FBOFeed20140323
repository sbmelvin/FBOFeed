<DESC>Under Statutory Authority Â§ 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) the Government anticipates entering into sole source procurement negotiations with Ira Weisenfels for an annual maintenance agreement for the Code Blue Paging System that the same firm installed last fiscal year at the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital. The above authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available from one source. The VA has a requirement for preventive and emergent maintenance to be completed on the Code Blue Paging System. This announcement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 8.405-6 (a) and (b). Other persons may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement by March 28, 2014, 4:00 PM CT. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interest received on or before March 28, 2014 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document is available.

<p>Relevant Excerpt from Solicitation Provision</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation of technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL <br /><br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS:</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive selection in which competing offerors will be evaluated on an integrated assessment of price, technical acceptability and present/past performance. The Government will award a contract to the lowest priced and technically acceptable offeror, who is responsible and whose proposal will provide the best value to the Government. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in provision FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each. <br />B. Technical Evaluation: Offer's authorization of servicing equipment.</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements of FAR Part 6 and Far Part 17, the price equivalent to the 6 months extension of services authorized by FAR 52.217-8 will be evaluated separately, and will not be factored as part of the total evaluated price for award. The Government will multiply the offeror's proposed Price by a quantity equivalent to 6 months for CLIN 0001 including Options under FAR 52.217-9, in order to evaluate the extension of services authorized by FAR 52.217-8.</p>
<p>B. Technical Acceptability. Next, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors on pass/fail basis, assigning a rating of Acceptable or Unacceptable. Technical acceptability defined as: proof of authorization to service this equipment. Technical acceptability is acceptable when the offeror submits proof of authorization to service this equipment. The offeror is requested to submit the followings.</p>
<p>1. Authorization of service.</p>
<p>An offer which fails to provide proof shall be rated as "Unacceptable" and will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Rating Definition</p>
<p>Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
