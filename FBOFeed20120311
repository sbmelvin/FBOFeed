<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT  NOTICE - VA PORTLAND

The estimated price range of construction project is more than $100,000,000.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is issuing this Sources Sought to identify potential interested firms that are classified under one or more of the following small business programs: (1) Service-Disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), (2) Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), (3) HUB Zone, (4) Section 8(a), (5) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), and/or (6) Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB). The interested firms shall be architects or architect/engineer firms capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, and utility infrastructure, with experience in the planning and design of hospitals, large medical and research facilities, surgical facilities, ambulatory care facilities, or similar complex healthcare projects, both new construction and renovation. 

Prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects; Medical Planners; Civil, Structural, Seismic, Mechanical, Geo-technical, Communication, and Electrical Engineers; Interior Designers; Landscape Architect; an independent Commissioning Agent; and Cost Estimators. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 541310.

Probable Scope:

This project proposes seismic retrofits on the Portland VA Medical Center's two main campus buildings (Building 100 and Building 101).  Building 100 is 680,392 gross square feet (GSF) and is listed as number six on VA's Extremely High Risk (EHR) Building List as prepared by Degenkolb Engineers, and Building 101 is 129,692 GSF and is listed as number 44 on the EHR Building List.  The proposed renovations will mitigate deterioration and failure of the buildings' tile façade and bring them up to current seismic code.  During the seismic retrofit, all in-patient, outpatient, ancillary, administrative and research services housed in Buildings 100 and 101 will be impacted.  To provide essential swing space while the seismic retrofits of the main hospital buildings are in progress, the project also entails demolition of an aging 25,349 GSF "Butler building" on the Portland campus and the construction of a 265,000 DGSF Specialty Care Building in its place.  To accommodate anticipated growth in staff and to address the existing critical employee parking shortage at the Portland VAMC, 600 above ground parking garage spaces will be constructed.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8). Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency. Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual. Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards. All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities. The space will be in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and PG-18-13 in all areas. Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost. The contract may include options for: construction documents, construction period services, and site visits.

At this time, it is anticipated that the Seismic Retrofit and Renovation design will follow the design-bid-build delivery method and the Site Utility design will follow the design-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the users' and facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method.

The completed project will be required to be LEED Silver certified. Renewable energy systems will be required as part of this project.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed. Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan. Emphasis will be placed on cost and scope management capabilities and previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the firm's, or teams', Quality Assurance /Quality Control procedures. In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation. The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology. Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered. In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered. An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected firm shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction. 

Interested firms must have an established working office within 100 miles of Portland, Oregon and be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of Oregon. 

Small Business firms having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought. Responses should include the following information: 1. Company Name, 2. Address, 3. Point of Contact, 4. Phone number and e-mail address, 5. Business size determination and qualifying Small Business status, 6. Certification of small business Status, 7. Provide three to five design experience projects of similar size and complexity.

Please provide your responses by 4:00 p.m. (PDT) on March 26, 2012 by email to ronald.ferrer@va.gov with Portland Sources Sought in the subject line.

This sources sought notice is for market research purposes in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award.
