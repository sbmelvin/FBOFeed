Vendors must also be able to meet regional product volume requirements; provide representatives and product for vendor demonstrations; and conduct product in-services for medical facility staff.

These vendors must be holders of a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), distribute products through DSCP’s Prime Vendor program, and carry a “full line of product” for the product group being considered.  In addition, any products offered for consideration must either currently be on a DAPA or the vendor must indicate their willingness to add these products to their agreement or schedule.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation AB133A-05-RP-1063 is being issued as a Request for Proposals.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 2001-23.  This procurement action is 100% set aside for small business.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System code is 334511 and a firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if its size standard is 750 employees or less.  Businesses averaging more than 750 employees over the last three years will not be considered for this requirement.

1.0	INTRODUCTION

The new NOAA Ship HI'IALAKAI requires a remotely operated submersible vehicle (ROV) for the ship-based field research.  The HI'IALAKAI will support government organizations conducting research throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago and U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands.  

2.0	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND SCOPE OF WORK

The diversity of ecosystem monitoring and assessment projects to be supported by the HI'IALAKAI requires the ROV to be capable of:
o	Reliable operation in a remote offshore environment, at time in open ocean currents, to a depth of 2,000 feet (600m).
o	Steady maneuvering near potentially rugged coral on the seafloor, at times making contact with the bottom.  This requires high power to weight ratio and a low center of gravity.
o	Using a video camera system with operator display
o	Staging from ship's deck.  This requires portability and straightforward control features.
o	Field maintainable, without special tools or training.
o	Option for later field upgrade, to add a manipulator arm.
Piloting of the ROV must be sufficiently intuitive for relatively inexperienced technicians, and as such NOAA requires that the ROV be a commercial-off-the-shelf product with a proven design and a number of completed previous deliveries.  Minor modifications to a standard package to meet requirements are acceptable, but a completely new designed package is not acceptable.

3.0	SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

The required remotely operated vehicle (ROV) performance and features are listed in the following, grouped by Selection Evaluation Factors (see paragraph 6.0).  Specific responses requested from offerors are indicated in bold type in the SOW.  For ease and completeness of proposal review, offers are encouraged to organize all responses in the same order used below, with paragraph numbering as shown.

FACTOR A:  PAST PERFORMANCE INCLUDING PREDICTED RELIABILITY, HISTORY AND FOUR OR MORE REFERENCES OF USERS OF THE PROPOSED ROV MODEL

3.1	Past Performance

3.1.1  Due to shipboard operations in remote areas, the ROV shall be constructed using Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology with a proven design, minimum of 50 completed units previously delivered.
   The offeror shall briefly describe the production history of the system offered.

3.1.2  Offeror shall provide a minimum of four user references with past or present experience with the ROV or nearly similar ROV design/model being offered.  For each reference provide full company or organization name, contact name and telephone number, best available Email address.  It is preferable to have references 1) that  address the kinds and types of requirements specifically called out in the SOW and 2) that are within universities, state or federal government.

FACTOR B:  INTERFACE INCLUDING EASE OF PILOTING, EASE OF REAL-TIME VEHICLE TRACKING, GENERAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.

3.2	Control

3.2.1  The ROV shall have the capability of pilot control signals through the umbilical connection.  The proposed shipboard electronic enclosure(s) and console(s) are to be compact, and well suited for displays, operator interfaces, and operator controls.  The pilot's maneuvering controls shall include:
Hand Controls:	One or two joystick controls, for coordinated thruster control
Thruster Power:	Minimum of three operational power selections - Slow for positioning and high precision maneuvering; Normal for standard vehicle operation; Boost for high powered speed and thrust requirements
Vertical Trim Adjust:	Precise vertical adjustment for buoyancy variations 
Auto-Heading:	Automatic control of vehicle's heading
Auto-Depth:	Automatic control of vehicle's depth
Auto-Altitude (opt.)	Automatic control of vehicle distance/altitude to sea floor (with optional altimeter)

3.2.2  The ROV shall have the capability of operator monitoring status signals through the umbilical connection.  ROV status is essential to safe piloting, therefore display of all status shall be suitably arranged in one viewing area to allow "Heads Up" piloting of the vehicle on an integrated display / console.  Essential ROV status (noted * in the following) shall also be available in some manner redundant to the screen display provided with the system.  Status indicators shall include:
*Depth:	Three (3) digit display, selectable units of feet or meters
*Heading:	Selectable display numerical/digital angle or "Compass Rose"
*Cable Turns:	Number of full circle turns the vehicle has made 
Propulsion Indicators:	 Thrusters and aux motor status (diagnostic tool)
DGPS:	Latitude and longitude coordinates, from external Differential GPS input
Time & Date:	Month, day, year, hours, and seconds 
Elapsed Dive Time:	Hours/minutes for present dive
Leak Detector:	Indicates hull integrity status from automatic leak detector system
Contact Sensor:	Underwater microphone allows the operator to hear when ROV or manipulator has touched an object

1.0	INTRODUCTION

The new NOAA Ship HI'IALAKAI requires a remotely operated submersible vehicle (ROV) for the ship-based field research.  The HI'IALAKAI will support government organizations conducting research throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago and U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands.  

2.0	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND SCOPE OF WORK

The diversity of ecosystem monitoring and assessment projects to be supported by the HI'IALAKAI requires the ROV to be capable of:
o	Reliable operation in a remote offshore environment, at time in open ocean currents, to a depth of 2,000 feet (600m).
o	Steady maneuvering near potentially rugged coral on the seafloor, at times making contact with the bottom.  This requires high power to weight ratio and a low center of gravity.
o	Using a video camera system with operator display
o	Staging from ship's deck.  This requires portability and straightforward control features.
o	Field maintainable, without special tools or training.
o	Option for later field upgrade, to add a manipulator arm.
Piloting of the ROV must be sufficiently intuitive for relatively inexperienced technicians, and as such NOAA requires that the ROV be a commercial-off-the-shelf product with a proven design and a number of completed previous deliveries.  Minor modifications to a standard package to meet requirements are acceptable, but a completely new designed package is not acceptable.

3.0	SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

The required remotely operated vehicle (ROV) performance and features are listed in the following, grouped by Selection Evaluation Factors (see paragraph 6.0).
