<DESC>**THIS&nbsp;IS A SYNOPSIS**<br /><br />The U.S. Air Force (USAF) intends to solicit and procure provisioning data and initial spares for the JTE program. The USAF intends to award this requirement as a noncompetitive contract action to Amherst Systems Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, 1740 Wehrle Drive, Buffalo, NY 14221 (CAGE: 1L4J7). This will be accomplished via a modification to contract FA8210-13-C-0001 (awarded on September 9, 2013) to exercise existing optional unpriced CLINS (0007AA, 0007AB, and 0007AC). <br /><br />This noncompetitive contract action is being taken under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency requirements. This is justified based on the fact that the USAF does not own the data rights to the updated JTE baseline which is currently being developed under contract FA8210-13-C-0001. All data rights are proprietary to Amherst Systems. Award to any other vendor would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements and would result in substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency except that foreign participation is NOT permitted.<br /><br />It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on or about 20 March 2014 and contract award is anticipated to occur on or about 1 June 2014. The period of performance will be TBD.<br /><br />Delivery of the provisioning data and spares will be to Hill AFB, UT.<br /><br />Respondents are requested to specify whether they are large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned SB, Hubzone SB, Veteran-owned SB, or Service-disabled veteran- owned SB, and whether U.S. or foreign-owned firm.<br /><br />As stated in this notice, the government does not own the data nor the rights to the data needed to complete the provisioning effort. However, this data will be provided with government purpose rights to the government in March 2016 at the completion of contract FA8210-13-C-0001. At this time similar requirements will likely be competed using full and open competitive procedures.<br /><br />A sources sought for this requirement was posted on FedBizOpps on February 7, 2014 under posting number FA821014RJTEP.&nbsp;

<DESC><p>Project Title: "National Prevention Information Network (NPIN)"</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for a 100% set-aside for small businesses with under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 519130 "Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals," with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) is contemplating an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award for an information technology partnership network and communication technology project entitled, "National Prevention Information Network (NPIN)." The anticipated period of performance for the contract is sixty months. Place of Performance will be determined on individual task orders. The solicitation Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available on the Internet at http://www.fbo.gov on or about March 25, 2014. Requests for Proposals in hard copy form will not be available to interested parties. Telephone requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background for the Acquisition</span>: The National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is one of three national Centers housed within CDC's Office of Infectious Diseases (OID).</p>
<p>The National Center for HIV/AIDS, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP) was established in 1994 to bring together most of CDC's HIV prevention activities under a single organizational home with sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention and tuberculosis (TB) elimination programs. In 2006, CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) was added, and the Center was renamed the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.</p>
<p>The diseases addressed by NCHHSTP share a number of commonalities. They have similar or overlapping at-risk populations-including racial and ethnic minorities, men who have sex with men (MSM), and injection drug users (IDUs). These diseases also have important interactions. Those who are infected with certain STDs, such as syphilis or gonorrhea, are at greater risk for HIV infection. Likewise, those who are infected with HIV are far more susceptible to TB disease because their immune systems are weakened.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Objectives</span>: The project initiative is to support the following: (1) the CDC and NCHHSTP efforts in providing timely information and resources to prevention partners through innovative approaches to knowledge/information transfer; (2) to connect partners in public health through collaborative communication, innovative technology solutions, and customer service; (3) to provide Web-based online databases, information resources, and technical assistance via online support, and (4) to support and apply inovation using digital channels to enhancing connection among and engagement with prevention partners and stakeholders to maximize health impact of NCHHSTP's Programs.</p>
<p>These diseases also share similar social determinants, including poor access to health care, stigma, discrimination, homophobia, and poverty. In the area of prevention and control, effective, science-based interventions exist to reduce the burden of TB, viral hepatitis, most STDs, and HIV.</p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Scope of Work</span>: The scope of work will entail two domains. Domain One will encompass Information and Communication Technology, which will involve the following focus areas: (1) Digital Media Channel Development and Enhancement, (2) Database Development, Analysis, and Management, (3) Special Data Products, (4) Web Content Management System (WCMS), (5) Scanning and Implementation of New Technologies and Best Practices. Domain Two is Communication and Education, which will involve the following focus areas: (1) Web-based Information Development and Management; (2) Digital Media Channel Management (including social media); (3) Digital Media Metrics (web analytics); (4) Communication Support Services; (5) Training and Technical Assistance; (6) Marketing and Outreach; and (7) Scanning and Implementation of New Technologies and Best Practices.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, equipoment, as appropriate to provide CDC with the required scientific, technical, and operational services, within the general work parameters set forth in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-On Requirement</span>: This requirement is a follow-on contract requirement. The current contract vendor for the current contract is Danya International.</p>

Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor. All task orders will be issued to the prime contractor. Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap. This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s). Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner. The NPS does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.</p>

<p><strong>SUSTAINABLE DESIGN:</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle (http://www.energystar.gov/ia/business/Guiding_Principles.pdf) for its planning, design and construction projects. By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design and certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. Firms shall validate their sustainable design abilities and practices through completed LEED certified construction projects and green building awards. LEED accredited professionals should play leading roles on the project team.</p>
<p>Sustainability related executive orders, laws, regulations, best practices, and some recommended products may be found at: http://www.nps.gov/dscw/ds-sustainability.htm</p>
<p><strong>UNIVERSAL DESIGN AND ACCESSIBILITY:</strong></p>

All planning, design and construction projects shall meet and exceed the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), Section 504 (program access) and Section 508 (electronic and information technology access) of the Rehabilitation Act. The 2006 NPS Management Policies requires that projects exceed these federal requirements and apply the tenets of universal design to provide usable and inclusive experiences for all. To meet the requirements of Executive Order 13548, "Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities", NPA assures visitor use areas and employee areas are accessible and provide the connectivity to all amenities so that employees with disabilities can fully participate in all programs.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is for a&nbsp;Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Job Order Contract (JOC) and is being advertised as a 100% set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns (FAR 52.219-27). The best value continuum source selection process to be used for this acquisition is the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) process as described in FAR 15.101-2 with the intent to award a single contract to the responsible offeror with the lowest price technically acceptable proposal based on the evaluation factors in the solicitation. It is the intention of this solicitation to secure specialty trade work as defined under NAICS 238990 (annual size standard $14.0 million) at various locations in the Metro San Diego area by means of awarding an indefinite-quantity contract at pre-determined unit prices and bid price coefficient, effective for a base period of twelve (12) months. Types of projects include, but are not limited to, electrical, mechanical, painting, engineering/design, paving (asphaltic and concrete), flooring (tile work/carpeting), roofing, structural repair, fencing, HVAC, and fire suppression/protection system installation. The contract also provides for additional option periods, for a total contract period of sixty (60) months to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. Delivery or performance periods shall be specified in individual task&nbsp;orders issued hereunder. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, is $30,000,000.

The contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The government intends to evaluate proposals and award a single contract without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Factor 1 - Experience, Factor 2 - Past Performance, Factor 3 - Safety, and Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used and award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of the proposal meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-price factors.

<DESC>NAVSUP WSS is adding the attached items to Repair Basic Ordering Agreement N00383-12-G-010F.  The estimated dollar value of this addition is $43,489,721.00.  This addition will provide coverage for the items listed on Attachment A used in support of the MH-60R/S Helicopters.  This Basic Ordering Agreement is with Lockheed Martin (03640) located in Owego, NY.  Lockheed is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of these requirements.  Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. Therefore, the items listed on Attachment A, are considered sole source to Lockheed. 
The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at below address.  
https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>This is published as sole source announcement under the statutory authority at 10 USC2304(c) (1), and regulatory authority at FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground-Tobyhanna Division, Tobyhanna, PA 18466 intends to negotiate and award a contract for the supply of the following items on a sole source basis to Teradyne, Inc., 1000 Peachtree Industrial Blvd., Suite 6-387, Suwanee, GA 30024. <br>  <br> The Army has a requirement for preventative and remedial maintenance services, calibration, and replacement parts for the Teradyne L393 Automated Test System (ATS).  The Teradyne L393 tester is used to support the AN/TRC-194 and AN/FRC-181 terminal subassemblies at Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD).  In the depot level overhaul and maintenance program developed for these systems, the Teradyne L393 testers are used to diagnose unserviceable components and confirm operational integrity after completion of repair or overhaul efforts. These systems are currently being used extensively throughout the Department of Defense.  At this time the anticipated requirement is for a one year base period with two optional, one year periods of performance.   <br>  <br> Teradyne is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and has the proprietary rights to certain hardware and software items within this equipment. They are the only source known that can provide the OEM peculiar spare parts, calibration documentation, and software rights to keep the equipment operating at an acceptable level of performance. Availability of this proprietary data is required to assure that the parts acquired, both new and refurbished, have been tested and determined to be suitable to return the L393 tester at TYAD to full working order.   The proprietary data is also required for the Teradyne technicians to provide telephonic support, on-site remedial maintenance, calibration, and preventative maintenance visits. Teradyne has the ownership of the proprietary data for the legacy systems and has the qualifications to provide the supplies and service required to maintain a fully operational test station.  The Government does not have a technical data package suitable for competition. <br>   <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any responsible firms believing they can provide the complete requirements of the L393 ATS described herein must contact the Contract Specialist identified below in writing within fifteen (15) days of this notice and submit a capability package which will be reviewed for consideration.  The Class Code is 66, NAICS Code is 334515 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Your response must be submitted via e-mail to matthew.a.chase@us.army.mil. <br>

<p>ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong></p>
<p>The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 423450 Medical, Dental, And Hospital Equipment and supplies Merchant Wholesalers with associated small business size standard 100 employees.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health, National Eye Institute, Division of Intramural Research, has a potential requirement for a Opmi Lumera 700 Surgical Microscope for performing clinical trials. The Opmi Lumera 700 provides the surgeon with brilliant homogenous xenon/halogen light for EYE teaching surgery. Apochromatic (Color Corrected) optics provide exceptionally high contrast and depth perception critical for all Retinal and Cataract procedures. Stereo Coaxial Illumination provide unparalleled depth perception and red reflex illumination unlike any system on the market.</p>
<p>This microscope highlights the following:</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin"><span>&bull;1)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Xenon/Halogen filtered Fiberoptic combination light source which provides surgeon with superior view over halogen illumination alone. This allows for proper visualization of delicate tissue in very small membranous cavitites.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin"><span>&bull;2)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Continuous magnification changer with Factors of 3.4x to 20.4x.</p>

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin"><span>&bull;6)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Stereo Coaxial Illumination affords the surgeon a safer surgery due to better understanding of delicate structures illuminated, that prior to this microscope invention, were not clearly seen before, e.g., cellular debris on anterior capsule. Adjustment of Stereo coaxial vs oblique is uniquely controlled by foot control panel</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin"><span>&bull;7)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>S8 Floorstand allows electromagnetic clutch movement for exact placement of surgical microscope in surgical field, and with the touch of a button, the microscope can be stored in the corner of the room so that the room can be used for other types of surgical procedures that do not involve a microscope.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Justification:</strong></p>
<p>The use of surgical microscope has substantially affected the practice of ophthalmology by reducing the amount of invasiveness required, reducing recovery time and fundamentally allowing improved care. Current eye surgeries requires direct magnification and illumination far greater that the power of operating loupes or substandard operative microscopes. This microscope is required for the Retinal surgeries in preparation for clinical trials. The utilization of this microscope reduces risk, improve outcome, reduces cost and is the most effective means in the treatment of eye problems.</p>
<p>Use with other equipment: it is used in conjunction with other equipment already found in the OR. This operating microscope would incur any additional training costs since the staff is fully trained on subject supply specified systems. This equipment would also see full utilization from its time of arrival. Without this required and integral ophthalmological surgery microscope, all required surgical procedures cannot be accomplished without extensive light and mechanical damage to the eye.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize itself with the requirements. Failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Respondents that believe that they are manufacturers or authorized resellers of the subject requirement specified in this announcement must provide, as part of their response: a) product, catalog, model, and/or part number(s); b) product description; c) all relevant information and documentation that the item(s) offered meets the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics as specified in the purchase description; quantity; estimated price or cost; shipping, handling, and/or installation charges; and delivery date after receipt of order. Also, information must be provided in sufficient details of the respondent's staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training, current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work, prior completed projects of similar nature, corporate experience and management capability, and examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p>The respondent must also provide their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>All responses to this sources sought notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Ms. Van Holley, Contract Specialist, at <a href="mailto:holleyv@od.nih.gov">holleyv@od.nih.gov</a> on or before the closing date specified in this announcement.</p>

Appendix B	7



?
1	Purpose of this RFI
This Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit preliminary information from vendors who are interested in providing operational, technical and service desk support for an existing system designed to collect data from across the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and provide for the management and reporting of VA information technology (IT) data from a single federated repository.  This system consists of numerous servers and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products integrated together in a customized fashioned to provide a view of federated assets and IT information across VA. 

2	Background
VA constructed the Enterprise Management Foundation (EMF) system to provide centralized management of the complex enterprise infrastructure. The EMF includes a Federated Data Repository (FDR) as the centralized reference location for all VA managed data repositories (MDR) with an Open Data Base Connectivity (ODBC) and/or a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connection with MDRs, allowing VA to map/extract information from the various distributed data sources.

The FDR includes capabilities to create management reports, provide intelligent analysis and trending, and enhance the ability to "view" all IT data from a single data source. The FDR incorporates a configuration management database (CMDB) and system in support of the IT Infrastructure Library.  Over 80 data sources (MDRs) are connected to the EMF FDR through a customized software connection. The EMF FDR leverages data from MDRs throughout the enterprise to present a national view of data and critical service management and provide enhanced release, configuration, change, and incident management.
 




3	Project Description
VA requires ongoing operational, technical advisory and service desk support for the "as built" EMF system which is currently hosted at the Austin Information Technology Center (ITC) with a Disaster Recovery (DR) site at Philadelphia ITC.  The vendor must have intimate knowledge of the design, construction and operations of the current system and be able to provide ongoing operational support, triage issues as they arise, apply fixes to issues and test any changes in a vendor owned offsite test system which duplicates functionality of the production EMF system.  Appendix A contains the hardware and software components of this system.  To support testing of system changes and debugging efforts, the vendor must also provide an offsite test system hosted by the vendor at their location composed of the elements also identified in Appendix A.   This offsite test/development must be connecting to VA wide area network (WAN) through VA's Business Partner Extranet interface. 


4	How to Respond
THIS IS A RFI ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  Responders are advised that the U. S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal (RFP), if any is issued.  The formal closing date for this RFI and for the submission of responses is March 12, 2014. All responses should be submitted electronically using PDF, HTML, MS Word or PowerPoint formats to the Contract Specialist, Peter Lewandowski, peter.lewandowski@va.gov, with subject "Enterprise Management Framework Operational Support - RFI Response."

<p><br />The contractor listed above has collected data spanning 10 years, assessed the buildings at both AFRH Campuses, and created special propriotary formulas based on the information collected to calculate AFRH's sustainability baselines and comparisons for reports, which were submitted to the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Any new contractor would be required to reperform the previous work by recollecting the data previously collected over the last 3 years and create their own formulas. Even then, the contractor would be required to match the output of ICF International's formulas without any deviations. New submissions have to be based on previous submissions to show comparisons, which CEQ uses to ensure AFRH is meeting its year to year reduction requirements as an agency per the Energy Independence and Security Act, and Executive Orders 13423 and 13514. The resulting contract will be awarded for a base and four option periods.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Fiscal Service will consider all affirmative responses no later then Monday, March 10, 2014 at 2:00 PM ET. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show how it would be advantageous to the Government to switch providers for this requirement. A request for information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to proceed with the sole source award.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discrestion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC)<br />(modified to reflect an acquisition under the authority of the Test Program for Commercial items)
<p>Modification 0001 to Purchase Order D14PX00002</p>
<p>Title: Voice Systems Operation and Maintenance (VSOM)</p>
<p>1. Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity, and the identification of this document as a "Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition" (modified to reflect an acquisition under the authority of the Test Program for Commercial items)</p>
<p>Requiring Agency: Executive Office of the President<br />Office of Administration<br />1650 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW<br />EEOB, Room 019/LL<br />Washington, D.C. 20503</p>
<p>Contracting Activity: Department of the Interior<br />Interior Business Center/Acquisition Services Directorate<br />381 Elden Street, Suite 4000<br />Herndon, VA 20170</p>
<p>This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) under the Test Program for certain Commercial items is for approval to modify the AT&amp;T Technical Services Company, Inc. (AT&amp;T-TSCO) a sole-source Purchase Order to add a Travel Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) and to increase the Not-To-Exceed (NTE) ceiling of this Purchase Order by $24,000. This Purchase Order provides the Executive Office of the President (EOP) continued support services for Voice Systems Operations and Maintenance (VSOM) telecommunications. Examples of the services provided under VSOM include all switches, switch software, voice mail, associated administrative systems, primary port network, expansion port network, and all voice terminals.</p>
<p>2. Nature and Description of the Action Being Approved:</p>
<p>This sole-source action will result in modifying the hybrid Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP)/Time and Materials (T&amp;M) Purchase Order to AT&amp;T-TSCO under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. This sole-source Purchase Order was a temporary solution to bridge the gap in service from the expiration of the previous ten (10) year Contract on November 23, 2013. The period of performance for the Base Period of this Purchase Order is November 24, 2013 to May 23, 2014. This Purchase Order also includes two (2) six(6) month Option Periods.</p>
<p>3. A Description of the Services Required to Meet the Agency's Need (including the estimated value):</p>
<p>The scope of this Purchase Order includes Contractor support of EOP's Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)/Disaster Recovery planning. Under this Purchase Order, AT&amp;T-TSCO provides technical expertise regarding the development and maintenance of EOP's COOP/Disaster Recovery plan, which includes all sites currently operated and maintained as well as any future sites added to the network. When this Purchase Order was awarded, it was not anticipated that travel would be required for the performance of COOP/Disaster Recovery planning under this Purchase Order. However, under Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 83, EOP plans to establish a COOP site, which is 65 miles from the original place of performance. Therefore, it was determined that some travel would be required for the performance of this in-scope work.</p>
<p>As a result, a new Travel CLIN needs to be added to this Purchase Order and the NTE ceiling needs to be increased to cover these new expenses. The NTE ceiling will be increased by $24,000 as a NTE ceiling of $8,000 for Travel will be included in this Purchase Order for the Base and Option Periods 1 and 2. While the total price for travel in ECP 83 is not anticipated to exceed $2,500.00, the Government determined that additional travel may be required in future ECPs, so it is in the Government's best interest to provide a NTE ceiling of $8,000 for Travel in the Base and for each Option Period if exercised, for a total NTE ceiling increase of $24,000, should additional travel be required.</p>
<p>4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>This is a modification to a sole-source commercial acquisition Purchase Order, which utilized Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the Government's continuing need for VSOM support for EOP. The acquisition was conducted under FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, in conjunction with FAR 12. This justification for the addition of a Travel CLIN and an increase to the NTE ceiling for this Purchase Order is prepared using the format at FAR 6.303-2 modified to reflect an acquisition under the authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items. Thus, the statutory authority for this JOFOC is FAR 13.501(a) sole source acquisitions.</p>
<p>As this Purchase Order modification will not exceed $650,000, the Contracting Officer's certification required by 6.303-2(b)(12) will serve as approval unless a higher approving level is established in agency procedures. Per AQD Policy, only the Contracting Officer's certification will be required as this modification will not increase the value of this Purchase Order over $25,000.00.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: <br />AT&amp;T-TSCO is uniquely qualified in having the necessary knowledge and in-depth experience for this highly extensive and complex requirement as they have been providing the VSOM support to the EOP over the last ten (10) years. This expertise is needed in the continuity of services under this temporary bridge Purchase Order until a new acquisition is competitively awarded by the EOP Office of Procurement. <br />The unique qualifications of AT&amp;T-TSCO of having the necessary knowledge and in-depth experience is supported by the examples listed below which further support this temporary sole-source bridge Purchase Order:<br />o The existing voice network and existing interconnectivity to other Government networks;<br />o Classified projects involving voice communications and their relationship to the EOP voice network;<br />o The existing multi-agency cable infrastructure including fiber, copper, voice, data, riser, and station cabling;<br />o Access requirements for all secure areas;<br />o Phone locations/routes/security levels/EOP phone policies;<br />o Extensive experience with performance under extreme circumstances with the EOP and associated entities;<br />o Extensive knowledge of disaster recovery plans and processes;<br />o Experts in the specially developed Presidential call handling features of the voice system and the integration into the day-to-day business of the EOP;<br />o Experts in the specially developed Presidential voice mail features and modifications and the integration into the day-to-day business of the EOP;<br />o Specialized call routing for EOP and its entities;<br />o Unique Presidential Central Office trunking and Direct Inward Dialing matrix knowledge;<br />o Unique knowledge of complex call routing through vectors across the hybrid network;<br />o Unique ability to modify the existing system to perform tasks not originally programmed or designed;<br />o Performance under the unique service level urgency required for Presidential service;<br />o Knowledgeable resources immediately available in addition to the on-site personnel;<br />o Unique skill sets with cross functional training;<br />o Existing clearances at the Classified/TSCI and Yankee White levels;<br />o Active BICSI RCDD, BICSI Installer, PMP, PMI, Cisco's CCNA and CCNA Voice, Avaya, Comp TIA's Net + and Security + certifications;<br />o Existing specially developed telecommunications management system; and<br />o Unique and extensive knowledge and understanding of the various secure locations within the complex and their associate infrastructure.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to perform the current requirement a detailed working knowledge of the VSOM System in the areas of programmatic structure, interfaces with other equipment, hardware designs, and interactions of these designs is required. Not only is the complexity of this acquisition derived from the requirement itself, but also the secure, closed environments where the services are performed and the equipment is located at the EOP and occasionally at other secure sites, which necessitates the addition of travel to this requirement. The security measures taken must be utmost extensive as this equipment is supporting the Executive Office of the President inclusive of the White House Office, the Office of the Vice President to the White House Situation Support Staff as well as the Office of Management and Budget, National Security Staff and many other entities under the Executive Office of the President. Thus, even to compete the original acquisition which established the 10-year original contract, interested parties were required to submit names and clearances to the EOP Security Office to be able to review background information supporting the requirement in a reading room at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building.</p>
<p>Hence, with the extensive historical technical knowledge, skills, and abilities of the VSOM requirement as evidenced above, AT&amp;T-TSCO remains uniquely qualified to provide the services in the short-term until the new competitive Contract to VoIP is awarded by the EOP Office of Procurement. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to modify this sole-source Purchase Order with AT&amp;T-TSCO to add the required Travel CLIN and increase the NTE ceiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:</p>
<p>This sole-source Purchase Order, which is being modified to add a Travel CLIN and to increase the NTE ceiling, is a temporary solution to continue services from the expiration of the past Contract until a new competition has been conducted by the EOP Office of Procurement. Due to the extensive security requirements, unique nature of the requirement, specialized knowledge needed, a sole-source Purchase Order to AT&amp;T-TSCO was in the best interest of the Government as it was not practicable to solicit other vendors to provide this service.</p>
<p>In accordance with Subpart 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, a notice of intent to modify this Purchase Order was posted on Federal Business Opportunities. Additionally, In accordance with 13.501(a)(1)(iii), the approved justification will be made publically available as required by 6.305(a) within 14 days after award.</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>All Travel expenses billed to the Government will be in accordance with FAR 31.205-46 Travel Costs. Additionally, all relevant clauses, terms and conditions related to travel will be added to the Purchase Order in this modification. Only expenses that are reasonable, allowable and allocable will be paid. The Contractor shall ensure all travel is approved in advance and the AQD Contracting Officer will review all Travel expenses invoiced to the Government prior to payment to ensure all Federal Travel Regulations are followed.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted:</p>
<p>This sole source Purchase Order, which is being modified to add a Travel CLIN and increase the NTE ceiling total by $24,000, is a temporary solution to bridge the gap in service from the expiration of the previous Contract until the EOP Office of Procurement has awarded the new Contract.</p>
<p>Through work under the past Contract, AT&amp;T-TSCO gained a working knowledge of the VSOM requirement and continues to bring the necessary combination of expertise, relevant experience, tools and key personnel that makes AT&amp;T-TSCO distinctively and uniquely qualified to meeting the particular needs of the EOP. Awarding to a Contractor other than AT&amp;T-TSCO would result in a high risk to the Government and substantial learning curve for a new contractor, thus increasing costs to the Government and potentially causing unacceptable delays to EOP. Any potential break in service would directly affect the Office of the President. These costs would not expect to be recovered through competition. The Government is minimizing the risk of a break in service by utilizing this temporary solution to bridge the gap until the new competition has been completed.</p>
<p>However, in accordance with Subpart 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, a notice of intent was posted on Federal Business Opportunities. Thus, the "market" is aware of this action and no responses were received. Hence, extensive Market Research was not completed as this is a sole source Purchase Order.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>There are no other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>10. Listing of Sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:</p>
<p>No sources have currently expressed interest in this modification. However, in accordance with Subpart 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, a notice of intent regarding this modification was posted on Federal Business Opportunities with no responses challenging the intent.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:</p>
<p>This sole-source Purchase Order, which is currently being modified to add a Travel CLIN and to increase the total NTE ceiling by $24,000, is only a temporary solution until the EOP Office of Procurement has awarded the new competitive Contract. It is anticipated that the EOP Office of Procurement will compete the requirement on the open market to maximize competition.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT
<p>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source contract pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, which applies when the supplies/services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate a contract with Applanix Corporation (APPLANIX), Ontario, Canada, for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), who has a requirement for the upgrade of two (2) existing Digital Sensor System (DSS) cameras, procurement of one (1) DSS camera, and renewal of software licensing and maintenance on these systems. Specifically, the requirements are for hardware and software components to upgrade one (1) existing APPLANIX DSS 439 DualCam Red, Green, Blue/Near Infrared (RGB/NIR) to DSS 500 DualCam RGB/NIR with 80 megapixel (MP) RGB and 60 MP NIR camera; upgrade one (1) existing DSS 439 SingleCam (RGB only) to DSS 539 DualCam (RGB only); procure one (1) APPLANIX DSS 539 SingleCam (RGB only); renew POSPac software maintenance/licensing of APPLANIX systems; and renew extended hardware and software maintenance of APPLANIX systems. This procurement will provide increased mission capability via improved image resolution, the ability to capture both nadir and oblique imagery, and system redundancy for increased capacity, and reliability. The equipment manufacturer is APPLANIX, and since 2000 NOAA and NOS have tailored its aircraft, employee training, workflows, and products based on the Applanix Digital Sensor System. This has streamlined costs and increased efficiency versus operating additional systems made and supported by other manufacturers. Therefore, APPLANIX is the only known responsible source that can provide the digital sensor system upgrades and new camera procurement, and the software licensing and maintenance required for this procurement.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be provided within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice. Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirement. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. local time, March 20, 2014. The responses may be submitted via e-mail to Katie Carter, Contract Specialist, at katie.carter@noaa.gov, with a hard copy to the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, 200 Granby Street, Suite 815, Norfolk, VA 23510.</p>

Practices that facilitate nutrient recovery and utilization from anaerobic digesters and other on-farm manure management systems; and d.	Provide a report outlining information found and results of the analysis performed on practices that are currently employed on dairy farms to protect water quality. 2.	Study behavioral changes and drivers for such changes to protect water quality that are associated with diary owners and operators.  a.

<p>1. The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for CA Incorporated software maintenance on behalf of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Enterprise Server Operations Center (IRM/SIO/ESOC).</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: Based on the specifications and pre-existing use of IBM Z Series Mainframe System within the Enterprise Server Operations Center, IRM Systems &amp; Integration Office (IRM/OPS/SIO) is seeking the approval of the purchase of CA Mainframe Software Suite to maintain operations for the Department's critical Compensation Support System. <br /><br />3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs: This renewal is necessary for the continued operation and support of the Department's critical Compensation Support System.</p>
<p>This Renewal of CA Mainframe Software Suite is instrumental in maintaining the integrity of the IBM Z Series System. This Software is used in the Department's Mainframe Payroll Application (CAPPS). Without renewal, there is no guarantee that the IBM Z Series Payroll Processing System for the Department would provide payroll processing and would directly affect the Department's employees worldwide.</p>
<p>CA owns these Software Licenses and only CA can authorize its use. CA is a proven product and meets the requirements of the Department; no other product is available and can meet these requirements. This product is already deployed, tested and working confidently.</p>
<p>4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 41 USC 253(g), FAR 13.501, Only one source reasonably available and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: CA Incorporated software maintenance is essential to the government's requirements and thereby precludes consideration of a product manufactured by another company. CA Incorporation holds proprietary rights to the software products/services and has not authorized any other company to provide products nor services.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: A combined synopsis/solicitation will be issued under FAR Subpart 12.6 procedures. The combined synopsis/solicitation will include this justification and will be publicized on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable: The Contracting Officer will make a fair and reasonable price determination in accordance with FAR 13.106-3.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted: Procurement of substitute products would result in further costs in software, training, environment expansion and ongoing maintenance.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: No.</p>
<p>10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: No sources have expressed an interest in the acquisition in writing or via any other media.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: IRM/SIO/ESOC keeps current with regard to new and emerging tools by reviewing technical publications and checking vendors' web sites. Therefore, if and when a product or products become available that is/are comparable or superior to CA Incorporated software maintenance, then IRM/SIO/ESOC will perform a technical assessment, including a benefit/cost analysis, to determine whether to retain this product or to transition to a new, more cost-efficient product. <br /><br />A combined synopsis/solicitation will be issued under FAR Subpart 12.6 procedures. The combined synopsis/solicitation will include this justification and will be publicized on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).</p>

Any delay in award will result in the government accruing substantial financial costs to perform surgeries elsewhere.

The available work space only allows for one company to occupy the space at one time. If two different companies were awarded the contracts, the work would not be able to be finished until springtime due to construction time required to finish both contracts.	-

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services.<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p><strong>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

<p>(u) "Reporting of Funds" is added as follows: This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.</p>
<p>(v) (v) Tariff Information.</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph ii above.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;</p>
<p>(B) <strong>A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS.</strong> If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS.</p>
<p>(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.</p>
<p>(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.</p>
<p>(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.</p>
<p>(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-</p>
<p>(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.</p>
<p>(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.</p>
<p>(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(w) "Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services" is added as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on separate contract as it is provided today.</p>
<p>(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience).</p>
<p>(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.</p>
<p>(4) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -</p>
<p>(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.</p>

A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground. Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor. It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>(a) In accordance with Section 326 of P.L. 102-484, the Government is prohibited from awarding any contract which includes a specification or standard that requires the use of a Class I ozone-depleting substance (ODS) identified in Section 602(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 767a(a)), or that can be met only through the use of such a substance unless such use has been approved, on an individual basis, by a senior acquisition official who determines that there is no suitable substitute available. (b) To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements. To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c) If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action. To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable. It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>Contractor will need a DUNS number, TIN number and be registered with www.SAM.gov</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and FAR Part13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document incorporates provision and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation and supplements. This procurement is for full and open competition. The NAICS code is 621511, Medical Laboratories. <br> The Utah National Guard intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for the performance of miscellaneous laboratory testing. The vendor must be CLIA certified. The vendor must supply lab test request forms, tubes, specimen cups, slides, and all other necessary laboratory supplies to the Utah National Guard for use on this BPA. Retrieval of lab results must be available through the internet. Most of the testing will be done on the weekends. The vendor must accept the government purchase card (VISA) for payment. Specific tasks: An estimated quantity for each test required will be provided by phone to the vendor approximately 3 days prior to the testing. The oral order will be followed by submission of the Lab Test Request Form indicating the exact number of each test required.  Specimens are to be picked up from two (2) locations: UTARNG Medical Command, 17800 S Camp Williams Road (Redwood Road), Riverton, UT 84065; and Army Aviation (Airport #2), 7602 South 4470 West, West Jordan, UT. Routine tests should be reported within 72 hours. Results are to be faxed to the UTARNG and all abnormal lab values are to be reported via phone call to the UTARNG. This BPA will replace an existing BPA set to expire. The intent of this BPA is to provide best value in meeting the laboratory testing requirements of the Utah National Guard. This BPA will be valid for a period of five (5) years. The basis of award is best value. A quote which represents best value is one that conforms to the Government's requirements at a reasonable and competitive price. The Government intends to establish this BPA with one or more vendors who respond with all required submissions on time, whose past performance does not pose a risk to the Government, and whose quote represents the best value to the Government. Please note this action is for a BPA, which is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis, via issuance of a BPA call order using qualified sources; this eliminates the need for repetitive and costly procurement actions. There is no minimum or maximum guaranteed order quantity or dollar value. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. All firms or individuals responding must meet all standards required to conduct business with the Government, and be in good standing. All qualified responses will be considered by the Government. The Government reserves the right to request a site visit with any firm submitting a response. Failure to comply with a site visit may result in disqualification from consideration. In addition to providing delivery pricing for medical laboratory testing, each vendor must include their company's capabilities, rate schedule (including any volume discount, etc.), and point of contact information. Please provide your submission to the United States Property and Fiscal Office Purchasing and Contracting Division no later than 1600hours (Mountain Standard Time), 20 March 2014.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items. <br />(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-(SSSA)-SS-2014-033 and the solicitation is issued as a pre-solicitation notice of intent to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC, DBA Meso Scale Discovery, and 1601 Research Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20850. <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements. <br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72, dated January 30, 2014.<br />(iv) There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement, the associated NAICS code 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Equipment Manufacturing and the small business size standard 500 employees. <br />(v) This requirement is for the purchase of an Electrochemiluminescence Plate Reader manufactured by Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC, DBA Meso Scale Discovery, and 1601 Research Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20850. <br />(vi) The features essential to the Government's needs of the MESO QuickPlex&reg; 120 Electrochemiluminescence Plate Reader are outlined below:<br />&bull; Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) Detection - MSD's ECL detection utilizes proprietary SULFO-TAG labels that emit light upon electrochemical stimulation initiated at the electrode surfaces of MULTI&shy; ARRAY&reg; and MULTI-SPOT&reg; micro plates through biomolecular interactions between the analyte and labeled reporter at the surface.<br />&bull; Sample Throughput<br />&bull; Non-fluidic, high-reliability instruments. All assay processing and readout steps take place in MSD's disposable plate-based format. No sample is transferred from the plate to the instrument and hence there are no complicated fluidics that may be prone to clogging and other failures. <br />&bull; Sample savings: Only 25 IJI of sample is needed. Other platforms lack the dynamic range and require dilutions that double or triple the number of experiments required for a given sample set.<br />&bull; Wide dynamic range: Electro-Chemiluminescence has a dynamic range that can be two-fold over any absorbance or fluorescence assay. Weak signals (obscured by background in other platforms) as well as strong signals (off-scale in other platforms) can be detected.<br />&bull; Simultaneous detection: Simultaneous detection of multiple signaling molecules allows testing a whole immune response with one tiny sample.<br />&bull; Higher sensitivity: Sensitivity is defined as signal divided by background (S/8). MSD is the best since the signal is the highest and the background the lowest. Higher signal comes from the sensitivity of tag detection (attomols of tag can be imaged reproducibly). The high capacity carbon electrode is optimized for high binding. Plastic plates cannot bind as much in an active form. Small defined "spot" concentrates material. Traditional coating of plates requires covering the entire bottom and the sides. Emission is in the red region of visible light. This reduces color quenching.<br />&bull; Lower background: No background comes from the orthogonal energy source (background from incident light plagues fluorescence assays). Only label near the electrode is detected. There is an equilibrium between "on" and "off" for all antibodies. In this platform, when antibodies are "off' and outside the electric field, they do not emit light. This is unique. No auto-Electro-Chemiluminescence or interferences<br />&bull; No washes needed: No wash assays allow for low affinity antibodies. Excessive washes often wash away what one is trying to measure. MSD only gets a signal from bound molecules. If they are outside the electric field they do not emit light. This is a unique proximal characteristic of the platform.<br />&bull; Single-use electrodes: Fixed electrodes embedded in flow cells get fouled and assay performance suffers. The burden of the fired electrode in MSD is a disposable, and therefore does not affect subsequent runs. MSD plates have an integrated electrode circuit that energized the label. No other micro titer plates have this feature.
<p>(vii) The anticipated delivery date is 30 - 60 days after contract award. The delivery point is F.O.B. Destination at the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Strokes, Neuroimmunology Branch, Neuroimmunological Diseases Unit, 10 Center Drive, Building 10, Room 5C103, Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision of FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.<br />(ix) The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The responses will be evaluated on the specifications of the brand name product meeting the features of the product essential to the government's needs and price. <br />(x) All Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with its offer. <br />(xi) The provisions of FAR Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. <br />(xii) The provisions of FAR Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.<br />(xiii) There are no additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions necessary for this acquisition.<br />(xiv) The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) are not applicable to this requirement. <br />(xv) This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Responses to this solicitation must include sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities of providing the product or service. The price quote shall include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, delivery days after contract award, delivery terms, prompt payment discount terms, F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), product or catalog number(s); product description; and any other information or factors that may be considered in the award decision. Such factors may include: past performance; special features required for effective program performance; trade-in considerations; probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item; warranty considerations; maintenance availability; and environmental and energy efficiency considerations.<br />Respondents that believe that they are manufacturers or authorized resellers of the brand-name product specified in this announcement must provide, as part of their response: (a) product, catalog, model, and/or part number(s); (b) product description; (c) all relevant information and documentation that the item(s) offered meets the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics as specified in the purchase description; quantity; estimated price or cost; shipping, handling, and/or installation charges; and delivery date after receipt of order. <br />In addition the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size must be included in the response.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2).

(c) If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action.

The HQAMC Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or another external forum.  The proper address for AMC level protests is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer (KO) at Mission and Installation contracting Office, Joint Base Lewis-McChord is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this contract, and notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the KO.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

2.	CONTRACT TITLE.

API, N-Acetylecysteine (NAC), USP grade

3.	BACKGROUND.

The VA Cooperative Studies Program (VA CSP) is the Division of VA Research and Development responsible for planning large clinical trials which they conduct at numerous clinical locations for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The CSPCRPCC purchased this NAC manufactured by MOEHS Iberica S.L.(MOEHS) in Spain from Interchem Corporation in 2013 (501-D30001) and 2012 (501-D20026) under Contract # VA 258-12-C-0070 to manufacture 300 mg capsules for use in the CSP # 578 clinical research trial (study) for the "Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography: A Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study (PRESERVE)."

Because two lots of the product were lost due to formulation and manufacturing problems, the CSPCRPCC needs additional MOEHS Iberica S.L. (MOEHS) API, NAC, USP grade, to make additional 300 milligram capsules to allow completion of the study by veteran patients.

4.	SCOPE.

Work on the CSP # 578 clinical research study for the "Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography: A Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study (PRESERVE)" started approximately two years ago. When the study started, the CSPCRPCC's Clinical Materials Manufacturing Section believed that 100 Kg would be more than adequate to manufacture all the 300 mg tablets required for the study.

A number of problems were encountered when manufacturing the first two lots of product which were not expected when planning the project, resulting in the loss of both lots. Because of the loss of the first two lots, the 100 Kg of NAC originally planned to provide capsules for the entire study is no longer adequate. Thus an additional 50 Kg of the API, NAC, USP grade must be ordered to complete the study.

The CSPCRPCC needs to purchase the API, NAC, USP grade from the same manufacturer that originally provided it. We require the use of the same manufacturer because:

a.	If we change API manufacturers, we must notify the FDA of the change. The FDA must approve the use of a new API manufacturer for the study. The API manufacturer currently used in the study is listed in the Investigational New Drug (IND) regulatory submission to the Food and Drug Administration as the manufacturer of the API.  The FDA requires certain data to be collected and submitted in the IND for the API manufacturer. We do not have time to obtain this data, submit it to the FDA, and wait for FDA to allow continuation of the trial using a new API manufacturer.
b.	If we change API manufacturers we will probably need to alter the product formulation because each API manufacturer has a different method for synthesizing or making their active ingredient. The differences in the manufacturing process include crystal structure, size, shape, flow characteristics, etc. These changes will require reformulation of the 300mg API capsule which is an expensive and time consuming process that was not budgeted.
c.	Reformulation of the 300 mg capsule could potentially result in the loss of additional capsule lots.
d.	The differences between different manufacturer's API resulting in different formulations could also bias the clinical trial (study) results.
e.	This study is also being conducted in Australia. If we change API manufacturers, the Australian regulatory equivalent of the FDA must approve the use of a new API manufacturer for this clinical trial. Thus if we change API manufacturers we would be required to also submit extensive information to the Australian regulatory authorities and wait for their approval to continue the study in Australia.
f.	There is a potential that either the FDA or the Australian regulatory authorities would require the CSPCRPCC to conduct a bioequivalence study to show the API made by the new manufacturer is equivalent to the API made by the previous manufacturer. Bioequivalence studies could easily cost in excess of five hundred thousand dollars which is not available for this study.
g.	The company manufacturing the API, NAC, USP grade must have a Drug Master File (DMF) on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DMF demonstrates to the FDA how the manufacturer meets the regulatory, processing, quality and safety requirements for the manufacturing of the API, NAC, USP grade.
1.	MOEHS, the company that provided the API currently used in the CSP # 578 clinical research study has a DMF on file with the FDA.
2.	When the CSPCRPCC submitted their IND to FDA to obtain authorization to conduct the clinical trial, MOEHS, through their distributor Interchem Corporation gave FDA the right to review their DMF for the CSP # 578 clinical research study.
3.	Three companies from which the CSPCRPCC will purchase product hold DMFs for NAC.
4.	We only have permission from the company that provided the original API to allow the FDA to access their DMF. If we changed to another manufacturer we would need to ask that company to provide the FDA authorization to access their DMF as it relates to our IND. We would need to obtain additional information from the new company including but not limited to stability data on their API. We would need to update our IND to reflect the new company, stability data, test methods, specifications and results and any other applicable information and submit it to FDA. This process takes months to occur delaying and possibly halting the clinical trial in addition to requiring numerous labor hours which were not budgeted for the study.
5.	Our experience is that each API manufacturer has differences in their analytical methods. Assuming there are differences we would need to revalidate our analytical methods and alter our test procedures which would require additional unbudgeted labor hours.

The CSPCRPCC needs to immediately purchase one 50Kg drum of the API to manufacture 300 milligram capsules for use in the CSP # 578 clinical research study. The CSPCRPCC would like to receive the API in-house no later than March 1, 2014 to allow enough time to manufacture, bottle, label, package, and ship the 300 milligram capsules to U.S. and Australian clinic locations participating in the CSP # 578 clinical research study so they can dispense the product to veteran and Australian patients before the current drug either expires or we run out of inventory.

Any delay to obtaining the 50 Kg drum of API, NAC, USP grade will seriously impact the mission of the VA Cooperative Studies Program and the health of the veterans enrolled in this clinical research study by delaying research designed to prevent serious adverse events following angiography. The research study budget which includes providing veteran patients with drug product also supports employee salaries. Stopping the study would stop financial support for many employees.

<DESC>5&nbsp;March 2014: This notice has been updated to include information from Industry Day to ensure all participants have equal access to information. The AF would like to thank industry for its participation in its industry day. The information provided was most helpful.<br /><br />26 February 2014: This notice has been updated to include the AF's industry day brief for interest parties to review.<br /><br />Previous: This notice of a one-on-one industry day was posted the same time as a RFI for this same effort "RFSE." That RFI had instructions that were updated, but the updated instructions for the RFI contained information regarding the industry day (the subject of this notice) that were confusing when read with the instructions of this notice. Those RFI instructions also contained an incorrect e-mail address. This modification is to provide additional time to register for industry day due to the confusion. Please see the updated documents. If you previously registered <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span></strong>you have received an e-mail confirming receipt of your registration from PCO, Peggy Japngie Lizotte, it is not necessary to register again. However, if you have not received an e-mail, please follow the attached instructions to register.

<DESC>**THIS&nbsp;IS A SYNOPSIS**<br /><br />The U.S. Air Force (USAF) intends to solicit and procure provisioning data and initial spares for the JTE program. The USAF intends to award this requirement as a noncompetitive contract action to Amherst Systems Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, 1740 Wehrle Drive, Buffalo, NY 14221 (CAGE: 1L4J7). This will be accomplished via a modification to contract FA8210-13-C-0001 (awarded on September 9, 2013) to exercise existing&nbsp;unpriced option CLINS (0007AA, 0007AB, and 0007AC). <br /><br />This noncompetitive contract action is being taken under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency requirements. This is justified based on the fact that the USAF does not own the data rights to the updated JTE baseline which is currently being developed under contract FA8210-13-C-0001. All data rights are proprietary to Amherst Systems. Award to any other vendor would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements and would result in substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency except that foreign participation is NOT permitted.<br /><br />It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on or about 20 March 2014 and contract award is anticipated to occur on or about 1 June 2014. The period of performance will be TBD.<br /><br />Delivery of the provisioning data and spares will be to Hill AFB, UT.<br /><br />Respondents are requested to specify whether they are large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned SB, Hubzone SB, Veteran-owned SB, or Service-disabled veteran- owned SB, and whether U.S. or foreign-owned firm.<br /><br />As stated in this notice, the government does not own the data nor the rights to the data needed to complete the provisioning effort. However, this data will be provided with government purpose rights to the government in March 2016 at the completion of contract FA8210-13-C-0001. At this time similar requirements will likely be competed using full and open competitive procedures.<br /><br />A sources sought for this requirement was posted on FedBizOpps on February 7, 2014 under posting number FA821014RJTEP.&nbsp;

<li>DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns, and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for this solicitation use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area: http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx</li>
</ul>
<p>--------IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT--------</p>
<p>Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2103. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.</p>
<p>DODI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DOD PKI identity certificates when accessing DOD information systems. The DOD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DOD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DOD and authenticate themselves to DOD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DOD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DOD Information Systems.</p>
<p>The following are the three entities authorized by the DOD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA<br />Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/ecalindex.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/</p>
<p><br />There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, and Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own (like our CAC card). Each person who needs to access the system will need one.</p>
<p><br />Availability of solicitations, FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.</p>
<p><br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx.</p>

Multiple contract awards are contemplated.  Each contract will be for a 1-year base period, with three 1-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Task orders will be placed against the contracts to fund construction projects throughout the year.  

Requirements under these contracts can range from $1,000-$750,000 each.  It is estimated that $8.5 million in task orders will be issued under the electrical construction multiple award contracts over four years.  

Request for proposals and award of task orders will be specific to projects in excess of $50,000 [Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001] and less than $50,000 [CLIN 0004].  

Requests for proposals for projects estimated to be greater than $50,000 will be issued to all electrical construction contract holders and will be accompanied by detailed specifications and construction drawings. [SIR/RFO, Section G, Clause G.1]  

As customers often require projects to be completed in an expedited manner, site visits may be scheduled within 5 days (or less) of issuance of Task Order Request for Proposals (TORFP).  Contractors must be able to respond to requests for meetings, site visits, TORFPs, task order mobilization, etc. with very little notice.  Typical response time for task order proposals is 15 days.  Regular meetings between contractors and the FAA will be scheduled at the post-award conference for each Task Order.

Expedited competitive procedures; e.g., rapid turn-around times (TAT)/completion dates, generally under 15 days, will be utilized for projects estimated to be less than $50,000.  In addition, it is anticipated that projects estimated to be less than $10,000 could be awarded by a designated Ordering Official on a more informal basis.  Approximately 150 work orders were issued at the MMAC in 2013 for general, electrical and mechanical construction projects under $50,000 each, for an estimated total of $400,000 for the year.

The Government reserves the right to solicit proposals for requirements below the $50,000.00 threshold under CLIN 0001 and requirements above the $50,000 threshold under CLIN 0004, if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government

Contractors will be allowed to submit proposals for both CLINs 0001 and 0004 (both less than and greater than $50,000), or only CLIN 0004 (less than $50,000).  [Contractors may not submit a proposal for only CLIN 0001.]  Contractors can receive a contract for both CLINs, for CLIN 0001 only, for CLIN 0004 only or none at all.  The FAA reserves the right to limit the number of awards to those that represent the best value to the Government.  However, it should be noted that a sufficient number of awards shall be made to ensure that at least two (2) of the technically qualified offerors have proposed on both CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0004.

The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 238210-Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors, small business size standard, $14 million.

Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-14-R-02915 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
United States Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (USEITI)
Background: The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global standard that promotes transparency and accountability in the oil, gas and mining sectors. It has a robust yet flexible methodology for disclosing and reconciling company payments and government revenues.  EITI implementation has two core components:
-Transparency: oil, gas and mining companies disclose their payments to the government, and the government discloses its receipts. The figures will be reconciled by an Independent Administrator (e.g. Contractor), and published in annual EITI Reports alongside contextual and other information about the extractive sector. - Accountability: a multi-stakeholder group (MSG) with representatives from government, companies and civil society was established and will oversee the process and communicate the findings of the EITI Report, and promote the integration of EITI into broader transparency efforts in that country.
Seven requirements for implementing countries are set out in the EITI Standard1. Additional information is available online at: www.eiti.org
The Secretary of the Department of the Interior is the senior U.S. government official responsible for the implementation of USEITI. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) within the Department of the Interior coordinates the efforts to convene the MSG and manages the day-to-day implementation of USEITI. ONRR, in coordination with the MSG, is responsible for managing the USEITI Independent Administrator contract. To learn more about our ongoing efforts to implement USEITI and to view the U.S. Candidacy Application please visit: www.doi.gov/eiti
Purpose: This RFI offers the opportunity for interested companies to provide recommendations on approaches for how the U.S. can issue its first USEITI report in compliance with EITI requirements and successfully become an EITI compliant country. Based on the EITI requirement listed below, please describe how your company is qualified to fulfill the EITI requirements.
Requirements:
- Conduct a review of the work the MSG has completed to establish the scope of the USEITI reporting process, the reporting templates, data collection procedures, and the schedule for publishing the USEITI Report. It is imperative that the scope of USEITI reporting is clearly defined, in line with the EITI Standard and with the MSG's agreed objectives and expectations for the USEITI process. - Distribute the reporting templates to reporting companies and government agencies, and collect the completed forms, data files, and associated supporting documentation, as well as any contextual or other information requested to be collected directly from the participating reporting entities. - Reconcile the information disclosed by the reporting entities, identifying any discrepancies (including offsetting discrepancies) in accordance with the agreed scope, and prepare an initial reconciliation report based on the reported unadjusted data. - Prepare contextual information about the extractive industries including but not limited to: a description of the applicable legal framework and fiscal regime; an overview of the industry overview that includes information about its economic and other contributions, leases held, the nature and scope of contracts, and relevant information about beneficial ownership; production data from federal and state lands; state revenue data; and revenue allocations and the sustainability of revenues at the federal and state levels. - Publish and make public the final USEITI report on a website established for this purpose.
Questions regarding the vendor and their product: (Vendors should address each question, in their responses.)
- Do you have experience in any aspect of EITI reporting in any other country? Provide a link or an electronic sample of your work. - Do you have experience submitting timely annual reports regarding financial performance, reconciliation of revenues, or other similarly related issues that are comprehensive, understandable, and made widely available and accessible to the public? Provide a link or an electronic sample of your work. - What are best practices for producing a fully compliant EITI report or similar report? - Have you recently, within the past 24 months prepared a scoping or feasibility study such as an environmental impact assessment, economic assessment, regulatory assessment, or other multi-faceted analysis for an extractive industry such as oil, gas, mining, or other resources? Provide a link or an electronic sample of your work. - Do you have experience documenting the government's policy on disclosure of contracts and licenses that govern the exploration and exploitation of oil, gas and minerals which would include identifying relevant laws, regulations, and financial systems that govern the extractive sector? Provide a link or an electronic sample of your work. - Do you have any contracts or other financial interests with any oil, gas, or mining company that may generate revenues from Federal lands and waters? If so, explain how you might handle the conflict of interest should your company seek to perform USEITI work. - What mechanisms would you use to ensure independence and non-partisan approaches to reconciling and reporting? - Do you have experience working with multi-stakeholder or multi-sectoral bodies or committees with diverse interests who will be integral to conducting USEITI work? Provide examples. - Do you have experience managing, analyzing, and translating complex and often dry financial data into easily understandable, compelling, and usable formats for the public? The public may include the general public, non-profits, community groups, local governments, state governments, and small to large companies. - Do you have experience designing and developing user-facing websites that explain complex information in engaging ways? Provide examples. - Do you have experience developing lightweight web applications that use modern, standards- compliant technologies to share and visualize data? Provide examples. - Do you have experience using and contributing to open source code and frameworks? We are most interested in those that relate to data wrangling, user-facing interaction and visualization. Provide examples. - Please provide any additional information you think is relevant to developing the USEITI report.
Timeline goals: - Anticipated contract award date is July 31, 2014. - Issue the first USEITI report in December 2015 based on 2013 data in accordance with the EITI Standard.
The following are DOI's responses to eight (8)questions that have been submitted by interested contractors.  
Question #1:  Based on our experience and understanding, we recognize that at this stage of United States Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (USEITI) implementation, the Department of the Interior (DOI) must both develop the foundational reporting mechanisms for later reconciliation  and validation by an independent third party.  Based on the nature of the questions we wanted to discern whether the Request for Information (RFI) is intended to identify firms qualified to: 1) design and develop an approach and solution for initial USEITI reporting; 2) conduct independent third party reconciliation an validation of USEITI reporting; or 3) both.  Please clarify the intent of the RFI in this regard. DOI Response:  DOI is seeking to learn more about the capability and capacity of firms to support the implementation of USEITI based on Requirements outlined in the RFI.
Question #2:  Sub-national reporting, including reconciliation of revenue distributions to state and tribal governments, is an EITI requirement that the USEITI seeks to address through an adaptive implementation request in its Candidacy Application.  To what extent is the respondent to the Request for Information (RFI) expected to address experience and capabilities in working with state and tribal authorities in reconciliation of revenues obtained from the federal collection of taxes and royalties that are distributed to sub-national entities? DOI Response:  Please refer to the Adapted Implementation section on page 14 of the U.S. Candidacy Application. http://www.doi.gov/eiti/upload/USEITI-Candidacy-Application-MSG-Approved-2.pdf
As it relates to expected experience and capabilities working with states and tribes, the offeror may include any relevant information per the last bullet in the RFI Requirement Section which reads Please provide any additional information you think is relevant to developing the USEITI report.  
Question #3:  USEITI identifies that it seeks a response to the RFI relating to best practices for producing a fully compliant EITI report or similar report (un-numbered RFI Question 3).  Recognizing that the complexity of USEITI reconciliation substantially exceeds most international EITI reconciliations (to-date), please address the extent to which USEITI would consider a pilot project that is used to define templates, data requests and protocols for extraction of both government and industry data, and which could be relied on to inform and refine an efficient and effective project-wide data collection effort.  In particular, please respond to this request with respect to any Initial USEITI Report timelines or deadlines that will drive contracting and deliverables in this project.
DOI Response:  DOI fully understands that there will be refinements to reporting templates and data requests, and overall process improvements made to the protocols used to implement USEITI, especially for subsequent reports. Please see EITI Requirement 7 of the EITI Standard. http://eiti.org/files/English_EITI%20STANDARD_11July_0.pdf
DOI plans to publish the first USEITI report in December 2015. Please see the proposed 2014 Workplan timeline that is available online at: http://www.doi.gov/eiti/FACA/upload/USEITI-MSG-2014-HL-Timeline-12122013.pdf
Proposed initial report timelines or deadlines that will drive contracting will be published in the formal request for proposal/quote.
Question #4:  USEITI seeks RFI responses relating to various characteristics of information systems, including user-facing websites, web applications providing sharing and visualization of data, open source coding/frameworks, and interactive data wrangling and visualization (un-numbered RFI Questions 10 through 12).  Please provide additional description of the intended capabilities of such systems, particularly with respect to Geographic Information System (GIS) frameworks and functionality.  Additionally, identify in your response the extent to which USEITI intends to provide a user interface for these data systems that will be dynamic in user definition of data selection (e.g., geographic areas, resource types, multiple time periods, identification of individual industry firms, revenue-source programs, etc.), extraction/ download protocols,  and updating (e.g., periodicity related to federal fiscal year revenue cycles). DOI Response:  DOI has not made any decisions relating to the various characteristics of the user facing website and information systems that will be required to support implementing USEITI. DOI is seeking to understand the capability and capacity of offerors to design and/or support such an innovative solution that might meet the technical requirements of USEITI.
Question #5:  Please provide any information that has been developed by USEITI relating to assessment or description of the anticipated level of effort required to perform the reconciliation of federal government revenues pursuant to a materiality definition identified for the USEITIs Initial Report (e.g., number of hours (level of effort), number of companies to be reconciled, number of lines of data requiring reconciliation, etc.).  This question relates a proper understanding of the specific Requirement to prepare an initial reconciliation report based on the reported unadjusted data by the vendor, and the preparation of a Response to the RFI relating to a vendors capabilities in assessing financial performance and reconciliation of revenues.
DOI Response: DOI has not made a firm determination on the level of effort, number of hours, or number of lines that will be required to perform the reconciliation of the first USEITI report. Scope and materiality were discussed at several MSG Advisory Committee Meetings.  Draft meeting summaries of those discussions can be found online at: http://www.doi.gov/eiti/FACA/msg-meeting-minutes.cfm
Please also refer to the Scope and Materiality Section set forth on page 12 in the U.S. Candidacy Application which outlines the decisions made on scope and materiality to date. http://www.doi.gov/eiti/upload/USEITI-Candidacy-Application-MSG-Approved-2.pdf
Question #6:  Has USEITI established a budget or range of expected contract services costs associated with the Independent Administrator solicitation (i.e., DOI Solicitation Number: D14PS00220)?  If so, please provide such budget or cost estimates.
DOI Response: DOIs estimated cost for the IA solicitation can be found in the U.S. Candidacy Application Annex 2: Country Workplan. http://www.doi.gov/eiti/upload/USEITI-Candidacy-Application-MSG-Approved-2.pdf
Question #7:  With respect to the required response to (un-numbered) RFI Question 7, please provide additional information with respect to USEITIs requirements and expectations that an Independent Administrator who is providing reconciliations and recommendations under a USEITI engagement be compliant with AICPA and GAGAS (Yellow Book) Independence Rules for nonaudit services, including (but not limited to) Financial Statements, Corporate Finance (consulting or advisory), Information Technology Services, Business Risk Consulting, and  Internal Control Monitoring.
DOI Response:  To the extent that the IA will be expected to be compliant with International Accounting Standards please see Requirement 5 of the EITI Standard. http://eiti.org/files/English_EITI%20STANDARD_11July_0.pdf
Question #8:  Are there applicable restrictions related to the use of IT development resources that are located offshore in foreign countries?  In responding to this question please address any security restrictions and sub-contracting considerations that must be satisfied with respect to the USEITI reconciliation project activities of an Independent Administrator. 
DOI Response:  DOI is interested in learning more about how offerors might employ the use of various IT development resources.  Security restrictions have not yet been determined.  Subcontracting restrictions will follow the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

<DESC>Posted: 5 March 2014:
Brand new SSC Pacific policies/procedures for getting non-DoD personnel on base as well as the number of attendees (which greatly exceeded our initial expectations) have presented SSC Pacific with some difficult challenges in hosting this Industry Day.  As a result, the Industry Day location, time and date will be changed. Please check back for updates to see when and where the Industry Day will be held.
Posted 28 Feb 2014:
For those who desire to attend Industry Day, please see the attached Industry Day Base & Building Access Instructions as well as the Base Access Form (Excel Spreadsheet). Should no one in your group of attendees have a DoD form of ID (CAC/NCAC/Military retirement ID, Dependent ID), please notify the appropriate Contract Specialist (Jacob Ward (jacob.ward@navy.mil) for ESS) immediately (no later than 3 March @ noon) as a Visit Request in accordance with the Base Access Form-1 excel spreadsheet is required.
Posted 25 Feb 2014:
INDUSTRY DAY: An industry day for this acquisition has been planned for March 14, 2014.  Please see the attachment entitled "Industry_Day_N66001-14-R- 0078_ESS" for details.

<DESC>The estimated cost of the proposed construction is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00. The Fort McHenry Yard is a federal facility under the management of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, and is located adjacent to the Fort McHenry Historic National Monument on Leahy Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21230.&nbsp; A&nbsp;pre-quote site visit is scheduled for Wednesday, April 02, 2014 at 11:00 AM, EST.&nbsp; Participants will meet at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Complex, 2603 Leahy Street, Baltimore, Maryland.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospective quoters shall notify via e-mail both &nbsp;<a href="mailto:earl.c.wilson@usace.army.mil">earl.c.wilson@usace.army.mil</a> (410)962-2022 and <a href="mailto:Josephine.E.Baran@usace.army.mil">Josephine.E.Baran@usace.army.mil</a> not later than noon, 01 April 2014 if you plan to attend the scheduled site visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seawall is a stone and mortar block wall approximately four feet tall and 425 feet long, along the harbor of Baltimore. The water level is approximately three feet at high tide, and one foot at low tide. The bottom surface of the harbor at the seawall is of a rocky base.The seawall has weathered through decades of storm surge and currently requires refortification in order to prevent further degradation in the wall's strength and stone alignment.The overall objective is to identify the required repairs for the seawall in order to restore the wall to a safe condition, capable of withstanding future storm surge incidents, while taking into consideration both environmental and historical impacts said repairs could have. All capstones comprising the seawall will be reset, as required, to their original position, cemented and grouted into place. All broken stones will be replaced. There are areas where asphalt will need to be removed in order to reset the capstones to their original positions. There are sections of the seawall that have heaved up from the base level, which will require capstone/stone removal and modification in order to reinstall all stones to a level plane with one another. All capstones will be secured back into place, as required, and mortared in. Concrete will be reinstalled from the capstones to the asphalt parking lot with necessary expansion and construction joints in order to prevent or mitigate future freeze/water damage.There are several interior stones along the face of the seawall that will need to be reset back into the wall, as these have shifted toward the water. Void spaces behind the stone wall as it borders the parking lot are to be backfilled with stone. All voids identified or later created through the course of repair should be backfilled with stone. The seawall itself should remain a free flowing wall, allowing water to enter and then wash out freely. Only the first two layers of the seawall should be cemented and grouted into place. It has been identified approximately 400 linear feet of the seawall will require maintenance of some level as described herein. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted at FEDBIZOPPS o/a Friday, 14&nbsp;March 2014. It is anticipated that award will be made around the 3rd or 4th week of&nbsp;April 2014 and work completed in the Spring 2014.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) is awarding this procurement of commercial services as a firm fixed price contract 8(a) Sole Source solicitation and award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items), FAR 6.204 (Section 8(a) Competition), and FAR Subpart 19.8 (Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program)). A non-competitive 8(a) procurement is permitted, because the estimated contract value does not exceed the $4,000,000 "competitive threshold" set in FAR 19.805-1(a). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services). This was a negotiated procurement, conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15 (Contract by Negotiations). As permitted by FAR 5.202(4), no pre-solicitation synopsis for this solicitation was posted on the Government Point of Entry (GPE), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).
<p>ED-ESE-14-C-0011 is a recompete of ED-08-CO-0118 that was awarded to Command Decisions Systems &amp; Solutions, Inc. (CDS2) as a sole-source 8(a) contract award. ED-08-CO-0118 expires on February 28, 2014. CDS2 has graduated from the 8(a) program and is not eligible for the replacement contract.</p>
<p>The Office of Migrant Education (OME) manages two discretionary grant programs to support the educational needs of migrant children, youth, agricultural workers and fishers, and their families: (1) the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP), and (2) the High School Equivalency Program (HEP). CAMP provides grants for projects to produce the successful completion of eligible students' first year of post-secondary education. HEP provides grants to help eligible students obtain a general education diploma. The eligible grantees under both programs are institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations working in cooperation with such institutions.</p>
<p>OME conducts national meetings for CAMP and HEP grantees and manages an annual grant competition. To support the CAMP and HEP programs, OME also produces occasional reports and provides technical assistance to grantees on topics related to the successful design and operation of educational programs for migrant children, youth, agricultural workers and fishers, and their families. The occasional reports include research reviews and synthesis, background papers, small evaluations of education programs and processes, and data tables and graphs. In most cases, data are already available in existing data files or reports, although occasionally data collection is required.</p>
<p>The purpose of this fixed price contract is to provide OME with subject matter experts (SMEs), logistical support, and technical assistance for the HEP/CAMP programs. This contract assists OME in providing technical assistance to grantees operating CAMP and HEP projects to promote program improvement and strengthen outcomes and accountability. This contract shall also provide logistical support for OME's national meetings.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for carrying out all phases of work associated with the major activities under this contract to provide technical support to OME across a range of subject areas including:</p>
<p>&bull; Logistical expertise for complex, multi-day meetings that may involve up to 130 participants.<br />&bull; Technical expertise related to secondary and post-secondary educational, training, and employment needs of special populations, particularly those involved in migrant and seasonal agricultural work, including fishers.<br />&bull; Coordination of the Mentor Initiative program.<br />&bull; Logistical support for webinars.<br />&bull; Maintain an existing online repository of online materials from webinars and meetings.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide HEP and CAMP discretionary applicants and grantees with technical assistance activities in the form of training sessions, document dissemination, meetings, authorized program services that are reported in the project annual reports, and project evaluation.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this contract will be a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs
     Office of Acquisition Operations
           Technology Acquisition Center
           23 Christopher Way
           Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
      
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Information Technology (OIT). This action is for the renewal of a quantity of 3,000 each GOOD brand name software licenses, the purchase of up to a quantity of 2,000 each of new GOOD brand name licenses, and associated maintenance support. This procurement will ensure that software coverage is maintained for encrypted email for VA mobile devices.  The period of performance for this action shall be for a period of 12 months, with one 12 month option period, if exercised. 

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is for the renewal of a quantity of 3,000 each GOOD brand name software licenses, the purchase of up to a quantity of 2,000 each of new GOOD brand name licenses, and associated maintenance support.  GOOD is an email client for government smart phones that provides Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 protection for data at rest and in motion.  In addition to licenses, the Contractor shall provide software maintenance that provides continuous 24x7 access to product updates and upgrades; uninterrupted access to technical support via phone and email; and uninterrupted access to on-line technical resources. The total estimated price of the proposed action is 
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), "only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it is determined that limited competition is available among resellers for GOOD brand name software. GOOD brand name software is the only software application separated by a sandbox environment keeping Government data separated and protected in a FIPS 140-2 certified solution, providing the ability to encrypt data in an "at rest" state and in data transit without relying on active synchronization or its own device encryption.  Further, GOOD is the only FIPS 104-2 certified solution (certificate #1247) approved by the Defense Information Security Agency (DISA), with a Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), for use with Windows Mobile, iPhones, iPads, Palm Operating System, and Nokia Symbian that can meet VA's requirements. This policy is outlined in VA memorandum VAIQ #7292407, paragraph 2, which states that all applications must be FIPS 140-2 validated. Based on the above analysis, the procurement of a brand name product other than GOOD cannot meet the Government's technical requirements.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2) the contract award will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) Page. In addition, this Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity will be made publicly available on the FedBizOps Page and posted on the NASA SEWP IV website with the solicitation.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any products available that will enable future requirements to be competed.
 
8.  Market Research:  The Government's technical experts researched other products such as Apple Native Mail and Airwatch Mail and it was determined that proceeding with another brand would impact the security of sensitive email being sent to and from VA mobile devices.  Apple Native mail recently became FIPS compliant, however it requires mailbox Activesynch to be enabled.  If Activesynch were turned on, then email containing Personal Health Information (PHI)/Personally Identifiable Information (PII) would be accessible by any device, not just those that are authorized.  This would mean that protected email would be viewable by untrusted devices, which violates VA security policies. Additionally, VA is testing  Airwatch Mail for use in the current exchange, however it is not currently FIPS compliant and is therefore not compatible. However, once it becomes FIPS compliant, it could be a viable solution to meet VA's needs.

Notice: Sole-Source Announcement

The VAMC, Salt Lake City, intends to negotiate a sole source under "Only One Responsible Source" per FAR Part 6.302-1 with the "State of Utah Department of Health" of which the U.S Department of Veteran Affairs Salt Lake City Utah VAMC will be participating in an emergency exercise as part of a "Strike Team" under a "National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) exercise scheduled for 31 March 2014.   

Description of Action:

a.	The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) exercise scheduled for 31 mar 2014 requires the State of Utah Pediatric and Adult Strike teams to participate.  These State Strike Teams are the people tasked with triage and pre-transportation medical care of NDMS patients.  No similar team exists in the State of Utah. 

b.	The requirement is for medical staff to support the NDMS exercise scheduled for 31 Mar 2014.  The strike teams will triage, treat and stabilize Adult and Pediatric patients arriving from Alaska during this exercise.  They will have all required equipment and supplies with them during the exercise.

c.	The State of Utah has assembled these Strike Teams for to respond to disaster situations.  The NDMS activations one of the reasons Strike Teams were formed.  No other government or commercial team has the capability to function in this capacity. 

Statement of Work (SOW)

1.	The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Program Development Branch (PDB) has been tasked to develop additional Mobile Acute Care Strike Team (MAC-ST) personnel to support additional response requirements for 2012 and beyond. The MAC-ST is the ESF#8 response resource, under NDMS, responsible for providing critical care medical support to public health emergencies when local resources are non-existent, overwhelmed, or otherwise inaccessible. These services may be rendered in coordination with the Department of Defense (DoD) or Department of the State (DoS). The primary mission of the MAC-ST will be to provide critical care support and flight preparation for ICU patients waiting evacuation at a Disaster Aeromedical Staging Facility (DASF). Veterans Administration (VA) participants will also have the opportunity to review the MAC-ST cache, operate and troubleshoot specialized transport medical equipment. The tangible value of NDMS training for VA medical staff is difficult to quantify the direct costs to the VA; however, what qualifies this exercise as being essential, VA is tasked with the responsibility of providing a "Federal Coordination Center". VA medical staff interacts with state and federal emergency teams. 

2.	The direct and indirect (incidental) costs of $5,000 are minimal in comparison to the training the VA medical staff will receive. The projected human resource cost is $3,760; and incidental costs, described as medical supplies and consumables used for triage are approximated at $1,240.00.  In this Contracting Officers view, the value of the above exercise is considered fair and reasonable.  

3.	Person of Contract (POC) Steven R. Gardner, Contracting Officer, NCO19, 970-270-9503
