This is a total small business set-aside procurement, the NAICS code is 541611, and is a request for proposals. CSAT is interested in highly experienced organizations able to handle a National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare which will implement a comprehensive program of information dissemination, knowledge application and technical assistance strategies to promote organizational and systems change at the national, state and local levels. The prime target audiences for this Center are Regional, State, and local child welfare and substance abuse agencies, including independent Tribal agencies and organizations.  As such the Center:

1)	Functions as the locus for the collection, dissemination and practical application, of the best available information on services and strategies for responding to the needs of families who come in contact with the child welfare system as a result of substance abuse;
2)	Helps communities identify gaps in services and develop integrated approaches to respond more effectively to families who come in contact with the child welfare system as a result of substance abuse;
3)	Convenes coalitions of policy makers, practitioners, researchers, consumers and
family members from substance abuse and child welfare to define new directions and strategies; and
4)	Provides targeted technical assistance through the use of national and local experts, who assist communities that wish to implement interventions such as problem/risk identification, cross-training strategies, staff co-location, and unique judicial/court strategies (such as family drug courts.)

This project is a re-compete to continue many of the activities that occurred under contract 270-02-7108 with the Center on Children and Family Futures entitled the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW), 2002-2007. The Statement of Work has been expanded to include additional tasks such as, the development of a training video and new tasks to support the requirement of the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-288) to fund and provide technical assistance to Regional Partnerships intended to increase the well-being of, and improve the permanency outcomes for, children affected by methamphetamine or other substance abuse.

<CONTACT>Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 427-1781, Fax 301 427-1740, Email sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for multiple contracts to continue the work and expand the impact of the AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPC) Program.  Work required under this contract will be obtained on an as-needed basis through issuances of Task Orders.  These contracts are for a 2 year base period.  There will also be 3 one-year option periods which may or may not be exercised based on performance of the contractor and the needs of the Government (as well as other factors) upon completion of the base period.

The ultimate goal of the EPC Program is to present the ?state of the science? on a given topic in a manner that can be directly applied to healthcare decisions made by clinicians, patients, policy-makers, and payers. Decisions may be made at the individual, group or organizational level. Topics are expected to cover all health care clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic areas, including prevention. The EPCs will provide a variety of services and products, including the development of evidence reports, comparative and effectiveness reviews, and technology assessments. These are systematic reviews based on rigorous, comprehensive syntheses and analyses of relevant scientific literature, emphasizing explicitly detailed documentation of methods rationale and assumptions. 

The EPCs are to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals in fields such as medicine, pharmacy, nursing, dentistry, epidemiology, statistics and data analysis, health services research, behavioral research, public health, social sciences, library science, and science writing and editing. Key personnel who are constant across EPC projects should include an EPC Director, EPC Associate Director and Project Manager. Individual projects will add other investigators, who will apply their scientific and content expertise in conducting systematic review methodology and managing the progress of systematic reviews. In addition, it expected that there will be ready access to expert individuals who can serve in Librarian, Statistician/Data analyst, and Editor roles. 

Multiple task order driven contracts are anticipated for base funding and potential supplemental funding. EPC work will likely focus on systematic review efforts on one of three threes areas for base funding: 1.) technology assessments that concentrate on specific technologies as requested by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Technology Assessment (TA) Program; 2.) evidence reviews on preventative topics for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Program and 3. evidence reports on a variety of topics in collaboration with private partners within the Generalist Program. It is anticipated that the number of EPCs assigned to a particular focus may differ from past experience and the work from each program will not be reserved exclusively for the designated EPCs. Some work in each program will be reserved for possible assignment to EPCs across the Program. 
An additional focus for assignment to one EPC will be as a Scientific Resource Center (SRC) to provide scientific and methodologic technical support to the Generalist Program and MMA 1013 Projects (described subsequently), including the DEcIDE Network. To avoid potential or perceived conflicts of interest, the SRC will not be assigned to Generalist Program or MMA 1013 systematic reviews. The SRC may also be assigned to work in the USPSTF or TA Programs. 

In addition to base funding, supplementary resources may be applied to EPC work. It is anticipated that, as in the past, supplemental resources will be available for additional EPC work in future years. For example: comparative and effectiveness reviews (CERs) are funded under MMA Section 1013. CERs focus on outcomes, comparative clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness of pharmaceuticals, devices, and health care services. Research is informed by the needs of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP. Another example: efforts with Federal Partners produce systematic reviews to inform policy and/or research agenda. In this approach, AHRQ acts as a science partner through the EPC to produce evidence reviews for panels making recommendations, to develop research agendas and to build coalitions of interest in advancing the science in a focused area research.
 
Task orders may address a variety of assignments and may include brief as well as comprehensive systematic review or methodologic projects, depending on the current needs of the program. The assignments will likely have tight and/or overlapping deadlines by which specific products will be required, and duration of individual Task Orders may vary. EPCs also will be expected to have the methodological competence and management flexibility to satisfy a range of solo and multiple tasks that need to be performed concurrently. Topics of task orders are expected to cover all health care clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic areas of focus. Clinical areas may focus on traditional therapeutics as well as complementary, alternative, nutritional, and other emerging areas such as genomics. Topics may also include a focus on implementation, delivery and systems of care, effectiveness and efficiency of health care and the group or organizational unit of analysis. 

EPCs will a.) conduct rigorous systematic reviews of relevant scientific literature. Systematic reviews will implement methods for general evidence reports, effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, comparative reviews, systematic review updates and other substantive reports of evidence to be developed during the course of the contract; b.) Synthesize results of systematic reviews and report the findings with high transparency; i.e., explicitly detailed methods, rationales, and assumptions in a format(s) appropriate to the topic and intended audience; c.) Advance the methodology of systematic review in organized projects which include detailed and descriptive reports; d.) Collaborate with partners, including other EPCs and AHRQ programs, to promote relevant, consistent, transparent and valuable implementation of the systematic review process, dissemination of findings from systematic reviews and methodology projects, and the EPC Program as a whole. In addition, an EPC may be assigned related tasks such as a.) Perform special analyses, such as meta-analyses, cost effectiveness analyses, decision analyses, individual patient-level data analysis; e) Collaborate with public and private partners in specific educational or training projects; for example, developing evidence-based curricula, providing training opportunities in systematic reviews, or in conducting educational sessions on interpretation and understanding of research studies; f.) Collaborate with other programs within AHRQ and the Federal government, where a systematic review may be supportive of that program mission; g.) Provide technical assistance to organizations that seek to use EPC reports as a basis for decision-making; for example, producing tools to enhance the quality and effectiveness of patient care, etc.; and/or h.) Contribute to efforts to develop relevant topics for systematic review; for example, scan published and grey literature; interact with partners regarding practices needing a summary of the evidence-base, etc. 

AHRQ anticipates multiple contract awards (12-15).  The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov or through the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.gov.  Potential offerors are responsible to monitor these sites for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about March 23, 2007.

<DESC>The scope of this project requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to repair the pier jetty, pipeline supports, and road surface at the DeLong Pier.  The work includes, but is not limited to:  Repair and bracing of approximately 600 meters of the 10 inch pier offloading pipeline, which extends into North Star Bay.  Work items include reconstructing expansion loop on pipelines, replacement of inadequate pipe supports, realignment of pipelines, and repair and maintenance of the pipeline access road.  In addition, work includes installation of protective guard rails to prevent piping system from vehicle impact at the marine pier area.  Ensure supports are installed deep enough to prevent movement from frost heave. Piping system requiring guard rails is estimated to be 600 linear feet.  Regulatory requirement is to provide traffic bollards/guard rails to protect fueling piping and equipment on piers, wharves, and roadways (UFC 3-460-01). Piping systems shall be supported and protected against physical damage and stresses arising from impact, settlement, vibration, expansion, and contraction.  The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.  Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift.  Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $1,00,000 and $5,000,000.  The performance period for this phase is 365 days.  There is a 245 calendar day winter exclusionary period from 15 September to 15 May wherein no work will be permitted.  This period is included in the total performance period.  FUNDS ARE PRESENTLY NOT AVAILABLE, BUT ARE  EXPECTED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE BY MID APRIL 2007. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THE SOLICITATION, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE PROPOSAL CLOSING DATE. Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation. It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 28 March 2007. Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted. This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) International Agreement, to US, Danish and Greenlandic firms. No hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed. Offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (see www.ccr.gov).

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
Office space must be contiguous and on one level without being split by a public corridor. First floor space is required. Space must have the potential for efficient layout; columns must be at least 20 ft. apart center to center and 20 feet from any interior wall and be no more than two foot square; space should not be ?U? or ?L? shaped or exceed a length to width ratio of 2:3.  The following space configurations will not be considered:  space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space; extremely long or narrow runs of space; irregularly shaped space configurations or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Space shall be located in a professional office setting and not within close proximity to residential areas, railroad tracks, busy intersections or one-way access roads.  Space shall not be located within a base flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  Space should not be located near establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold or served, or where there are tenants related to drug treatment or detention facilities.  A setback of 20 feet is required when new construction is proposed.  Both existing space and new construction will be considered. The space must be fully serviced and altered to meet the Federal Government?s requirements for fire and life safety and handicap accessibility.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease including a total of ninety (90) on-site parking spaces: forty-five (45) on-site parking spaces for employees and forty-five (45) on-site parking spaces for visitors (including handicapped).  Employee parking shall be separate from visitor parking.

A brand name memo is attached to this posting.  Deltek Systems is the developer and sole distributor of the wInsight Earned Value Management (EVM) software.  wInsight is the only EVM data analysis and reporting software that is compatible with Dassian EVC, the current EVC.   The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Deltek Systems Inc.  for Licenses and Maintenance.  Specifically, the requirement is as follows: (20) wInsight Concurrent Licenses, (10) wInsight Admin, Concurrent  Licenses, (20) C/S Glue Concurrent Licenses, (1) wInsight Dashboard Component, Risk+ (130), wInsight Web Seats (500), Briefing Wizard, Concurrent (20) and 12 months of Maintenance.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may submit a capability statement.  All capability statements received in response to this notice will be considered by the Government for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement.  The Government reserves the right to process this procurement as a sole source based on the responses received.  Send capability statements for N00421-07-R-0042 to the attention of Yarinee Tafur, Contracts, Code 2.5.1.1.4 via email yarinee.tafur@navy.mil or fax to (301) 757-6516.

BRAND NAME MEMO

Navy ERP currently uses SAP R/3 to support the Program Management, Financial, and Logistic processes being deployed to the Navy.  The solution is comprised of a mixture of standard SAP, SAP enhancements, and non-SAP tools.  Standard SAP has limitations in the area of Earned Value Management (EVM), namely it does not meet the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11 and DoD requirements for an EVM system and it creates errors in EVM baseline data during processing.  The Dassian Earned Value Composite (EVC), procured under a separate action, overcomes many of the SAP limitations and maintains an accurate baseline during processing.  However, EVC was not designed to support the complete analysis of EVM data and reporting requirements required by the OMB circular.  Instead, EVC was developed to be complimentary to wInsight, with an extract function to provide data to wInsight.  wInsight is the industry standard (much like MS-Word is a recognized standard for word processing) for conducting analysis on EVM data and reporting in the required formats.  Without wInsight, Navy ERP will not be in full compliance with the OMB circular and DoD requirements.  

Deltek Systems is the developer and sole distributor of the wInsight EVM software.  wInsight is the only EVM data analysis and reporting software that is compatible with Dassian EVC.

<DESC>Solicitation N00421-07-T-0083 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  This action is set aside for small business.  The Government intends to purchase on a firm fixed-price basis and to solicit and negotiate the proposed purchase order on a sole source basis with Xicom Technology for the items listed below, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. The required Ku-Band amplifier and accessories are in support of the 5th Army Advanced Liaison (ADVON and Unified Command Suite (UCS) Model-C and Spares projects.  This equipment is required to build first respondent communication training vehicles.  These vehicles will allow hands on training and will contain an area for subject matter expert instruction to UCS team members.  The current requirement supports UHF high frequency satellite radio communication.  These systems will be used to communicate with all branches of military service command post and deployed troops; their reliability is key to the success of the UCS program.  The program requires a high performance amplifier that can both transmit and receive signals with a wide range of prime power to effectively communicate in demanding environments.  The amplifier must contain a fully integrated antenna-mount unit and removable power supply for ease of interchangeability.  The amplifier must possess the ability to be used outdoors without additional shelter and have self-contained cooling, and monitor and control (M&C) systems.  Lastly, the amplifiers must be relatively light in weight, weighing no more than 38 pounds, and must have dimensions no longer than 16.25 long, 9.2 inches in height, and 8.6 in width to fit in a small compartment within the UCS vehicle.  These characteristics are vital to sustain communications for the troops during deployment, which may be located in remote areas where connectivity is limited.  Only Xicom Technology can supply the requested Ku-Band outdoor amplifier and accessories that meet the 5th Army project requirements.  The contract line item numbers and description are **CLIN 0001, Quantity 2 ea, P/N: 305-0352-111, Antenna mounted 25W Ku-Band Bucxts-25K-B1; CLIN 0002, Quantity 2 ea, P/N: 305-0347-001, Antenna mounted AC to DC Power Supply XTPS-400-28D; CLIN 0003, Quantity 2 ea, P/N: RJ45, Ethernet (RJ45) port option XTS-25K-B1 BUC; and CLIN 0004, Quantity 2 ea, P/N: 350-0929-025, Power cable between XTPS power supply and BUC.  Award is expected 22 March 2007.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received by 16 March 2007.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  Facsimile proposals are acceptable.  For information contact Mary Jean Orwig, Code 251233, Telephone (301)995-8112, FAX(301)995-8670 or via e-mail: mary.orwig@navy.mil.

It should also include how the contractor intends to meet the Government?s technical and schedule requirements.  The paper(s) should also include where applicable prior safety certifications, material release and type classification approvals and who they were approved with. Only type classified Army approved ammunition / pyrotechnic (e.g. M30, M31, M34, M35 Rounds) will be utilized for acceptance within pyrotechnic material solution. 

If this requirement is determined to be a small business set-aside, the prime contractor shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials.  Small and large business prime contractors shall state the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime and each team member in their capability paper.  Reference FAR 52.219-14(b) (2) Supplies, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply to this contract and will be considered in making a set-aside determination for the IEDES kits.  

Improvised Explosive Device Effects Simulator kits are a PM-TRADE program addressing the requirement that will assist the Army in training the joint and individual services on operational support key tasks, conditions, and standards needed to achieve U.S. Military IED objectives.  The IEDES is designed to train key tasks of Explosive Hazards (EHs) defeat, in support of full spectrum operations and conflicts, to include Homeland Security.  EH defeat consists of the ability to predict, prevent, detect, classify, neutralize, mark, report, and record EH; and to protect personnel, equipment, and facilities from EH effects.  The mission area also includes the requirement of acquisition of EH devices, for the purpose of exploiting emerging threat technologies, developing countermeasures, render safe procedures, techniques, and tactics, to mitigate emerging EH threats.  The IEDES is configured to simulate a Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large explosive signature; however, it is not configured to pinpoint a specific IED. 

Currently, there are a variety of fielded, under development, or available as Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies that can be adapted to partially support the mission.   The IEDES kits will be delivered to each installation Training Support Center, to the Combined Training Centers (CTCs), and any mobilization unit or power-projection platform DOD wide.  IEDES will be available to each Program of Instruction (POI) course manager.  The IEDES family of devices will be further developed, and future capability improvements will occur in increments, as technical advances will allow. These kits are required to provide the functions listed within, ?The minimum requirements for an A and B kit.?  Attachment 1 delineates minimum IEDES A and B Kit requirements.  Attachment 2 consists of Draft Sections B and F for Pyro and Non-Pyro IEDES.   

PEO STRI has a requirement for deliveries to commence within eight months after contract award.  The initial deliveries are to be made in accordance with the Army?s future distribution plan. The contractor will be required to assemble and deliver the IEDES kits for Government test and evaluation within an initial delivery requirement of eight months. This training device will be fielded to the entire Army force structure over a thirty six month period with potential for additional devices for Joint Services. The IEDES is an enduring training capability based on an Army approved requirements document. The Government?s intends to field the first increment within the first three years of contract. 

The Government intends to select a single prime contractor capable of producing non-pyrotechnics IEDES kits and a single prime contractor capable of producing pyrotechnics IEDES kits or a single prime contractor to complete both for an 8-36 month initial delivery period, with two additional option years.

Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.  3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.

<SUBJECT>R -- Update Software and Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis (ROC) and Related Analyses Relevant to the Fields of Alcohol, Drug and Psychiatric Epidemiology
<SOLNBR>NIAAA-07-05
<RESPDATE>042307
<CONTACT>Patricia Hanacek, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-6226, Fax 301-443-3891, Email hanacekp@mail.nih.gov - Patricia Hanacek, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-6226, Fax 301-443-3891, Email hanacekp@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the University of Chicago to update software and the graphical user interface (GUI) for receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and related analyses relevant to the fields of alcohol, drug and psychiatric epidemiology.

Dr. Charles Metz, Professor of Radiology and Medical Physics at the University of Chicago, is chiefly responsible for development of the binomial model for fitting ROC curves and testing differences between ROC curves using maximum likelihood estimation.  Based on his work, ROC analysis has become a standard in medical imaging research and has been applied to a variety of problems in domains from psychophysics to epidemiology.  Over the years, numerous advances in statistical algorithms have been introduced by Dr. Metz, including the construction of ROC curves from continuous data and/or correlated tests, proper ROC curve fitting for problematic tests, and partial area under the ROC curve for highly sensitive tests.  Some of those advances have been incorporated into ROCKIT software, developed by Dr. Metz and his colleagues at the University of Chicago.  

Dr. Metz is a founder of the application of ROC technology to medical imaging and over the past 25 years his methodologic advances in this area have far surpassed the work of other scientists engaged in this field of inquiry.  He has developed new algorithms for ROC curve fitting that are both reliable and robust, and that provide solutions to real-life problems encountered in medical decision making.

The purpose of this project is to upgrade and add new statistical algorithms to existing computer software maintained by Dr. Metz and his colleagues at the University of Chicago.  No other source has comparable existing software.  No other source has developed algorithms for new methodologies in ROC analysis that are relevant at the current time to the Institute's mission, or more generally to alcohol, drug, and psychiatric epidemiology.  No other source can implement Dr. Metz's new ROC algorithms since he has years of experience in simulation testing and understands best the nature of the theoretical models underlying the algorithms.  No other source has existing software like ROCKIT that provides the foundation for the inclusion of new and related algorithms.  No other source has 25 years of experience implementing ROC algorithms.  No other source has the expertise and knowledge of ROC analysis necessary to implement new algorithms into existing software, including ROCKIT, which Dr. Metz himself created.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was developed in statistical decision theory and later applied to signal detection theory.  Although signal detection theory was applied initially to problems in radar, ROC analysis was successfully used in a large variety of studies in psychology and psychophysics by the mid-1960s.  Since that time, ROC analysis has increasingly been applied to medical decision making, largely in radiology, but its full potential in epidemiology has yet to be realized.

ROC analysis produces curves that graphically represent sensitivity and specificity, calculated at all possible threshold values.  An important aspect of ROC analysis is that it provides a common quantitative index describing the area under an ROC curve.  This index summarizes the tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity at each point along the ROC curve.

The need for this overall summary measure of test performance in epidemiology cannot be overstated.

At present, ROC models have been developed using both parametric and nonparametric methods and can be used with categorical or quantitative data.  Methodologies are available that allow investigators to account for the effects of covariates on test performance, and statistical tests have been developed for the comparison of areas under two ROC curves.

This project is motivated by the need for updated software and graphical user interface (GUI) for most common ROC analyses relevant to the fields of alcohol, drug, and psychiatric epidemiology.

Requirements and Tasks:  The tasks are to be conducted in the context of the pre-existing ROCKIT software to accommodate data sets with sample sizes up to 100,000:  cleaning and modularization of the ROCKIT computation engine to ensure its stability for a broad range of data sets and to make it usable with essentially any operating system, including SAS and other statistical software; addition of options such as "proper" ROC curve-fitting models and alternative accuracy indices such as partial area; development of a convenient and reliable GUI that allows a wide variety of input-format options and provides ROC plots as well as quantitative output; refinement and expansion of the current User's Guide to include additional tutorial material on ROC analysis and links to relevant publications that can be obtained online; inclusion of nonparametric approaches to generating and testing differences between ROC curves; and inclusion of existing approaches to ROC regression to account for covariates, preferably logit and probit models.

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, the University of Chicago is the only source that is capable of updating ROC software, the ROC GUI upgrading and adding new statistical software since no other  source has comparable existing software. 

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays.   

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>R -- Calculating DALYs Attributable to Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders (Separately) and Attributable to Alcohol and Drug Use (Separately) as Risk Factors for Disease and Injury
<SOLNBR>NIAAA-07-06
<RESPDATE>042307

<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with The Research Institute for Public Health and Addiction, ISGF, Konradstr. 32, CH 8031 Zurich, Switzerland to calculate Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to alcohol and drug use disorders (separately) attributable to alcohol and drug use (separately) as risk factors for disease and injury.  Similar analyses to produce DALYs will be conducted for tobacco use, obesity, and all major mood and anxiety disorders assessed in Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).

Dr. Jurgen Rehm is the one scientist whose familiarity with alcohol and related neuropsychiatric DALYs is unequalled worldwide.  His scientific relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO) is invaluable, as frequent changes to the calculations of burden of disease in other areas may be relevant to alcohol and related burden estimates.  His close working relationship with WHO scientists responsible for producing Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates ensures that all new statistical methodologies relevant to alcohol and its associated disabilities will be incorporated into the work of this project.  

No other source has either the years of experience working with the derivation of DALYs, or the close and respected relationship that Jurgen Rehm shares, not only with the WHO, but also with other scientists worldwide who work in this domain.  No other source has the expertise, knowledge, or history of responsibility for development and implementation of new and advanced methodology in the derivation of global disease estimates in alcohol and substantively related areas.  No other source has Dr. Rehm's access to the expertise of WHO scientists who are responsible for implementing GBD-related methodologies.  No other source has the statistical expertise or knowledge to implement new methodology in disease burden estimates of alcohol and related disorders that will contribute to the products of this project.  

Worldwide estimates of DALYs are produced under the auspices of the WHO in collaboration with the World Bank, using a standardized methodology to produce estimates of GBD and mortality and morbidity attributable to risk factors such as alcohol use and drug use.  The WHO maintains a small cadre of extremely talented scientists who are entrusted with the proposal and development of advances in DALY methodology and the identification and legitimization of the best sources of morbidity and mortality data.

The requirements include the capability to perform all phases to estimate DALYs, using Wave 1 (prevalence estimates) and Wave 2 (incidence estimates) for the NIAAA NESARC  to include:  estimation of DALYs attributable to alcohol use disorders and alcohol as a risk factor; estimation of DALYs attributable to drug use disorders and drug use as a risk factor; estimation of DALYs for each mood and anxiety disorder (and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) assessed in the NESARC; and, estimation of DALYs for obesity and tobacco use as risk factors.


Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, The Research Institute for Public Health and Addiction, ISGF, Konradstr. 32, CH 8031 Zurich, Switzerland is the only source that is capable of calculating Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to alcohol and drug use disorders (separately) attributable to alcohol and drug use (separately) as risk factors for disease and injury; and, conduct similar analyses to produce DALYs for tobacco use, obesity, and all major mood and anxiety disorders assessed in Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).

<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with KDK Survey Consulting for the Survey Management and Design of Large National Surveys on Alcohol Use Disorders and Their Associated Disabilities. 

Mr. Kaplan, of KDK Survey Consulting, has managed large psychiatric epidemiology surveys of national scope and complexity for over 25 years.  Psychiatric surveys, because of their sensitive nature, require highly specialized skills at each phase of the associated survey operations.  There is no other source with expertise, knowledge, and extensive experience comparable to Mr. Kaplan's in the conduct and management of psychiatric epidemiologic surveys.  No other source has the specialized understanding required for the successful conduct of large, complex psychiatric surveys.  No other source has mastered all phases of psychiatric epidemiology survey work, including design of the sampling frame, weighting of data, interview construction, interviewer training, field operations including the supervision of hundreds of interviewers during the data collection phases of the survey, and data cleaning, imputation, and statistical analysis.  

Unlike most senior survey analysts in the field today, who are extremely specialized, Mr. Kaplan is of the "old school", that is, he has extensive and focused experience in each and every aspect of survey operations and planning.  Moreover, this experience relates years of experience in the planning, direction, and implementation of large psychiatric epidemiology surveys of the U.S. general population.  No other source demonstrates Mr. Kaplan's combination of broad knowledge of survey research with highly specialized knowledge of all aspects of psychiatric epidemiology.

In addition, no other source has the direct experience with the changing standards of psychiatric epidemiology research that is necessary for a full appreciation of how contemporary standards must be met.  No other source has the knowledge and capabilities to translate new and emerging survey methodology in the field of psychiatric epidemiology and the awareness of exactly how such technology must be modified to accommodate this highly specialized survey research area.  Therefore, no other source can successfully accomplish the requirements of this contract.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, KDK Survey Consulting, 43303 Chokeberry Square, Ashburn, VA  20147 is the only source that is capable of conducting the, "Survey Management and Design of Large National Surveys on Alcohol Use Disorders and Their Associated Disabilities". 
 
To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays.

A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) established the Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program in 1979. The primary objective of this program was and continues to be the systematic evaluation of the risk-significance of U.S. commercial nuclear power reactor operational events. Under this requirement, the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) of the NRC will systematically evaluate U.S. nuclear plant operating experience to identify and document the operating events that were most likely to lead to inadequate core cooling and severe core damage (precursors), if additional failures had occurred. Using standardized plant-specific models provided by the NRC, the contractor shall perform detailed risk analyses of events or conditions that have occurred during all phases of reactor operations. Additionally, the contractor shall perform Large Early Release Frequency (LERF) analyses when requested for selected events, again using models provided by the NRC.  The contractor shall also provide on-call probabilistic risk analysis support to NRC staff for regulatory issues. 

It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. 

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be four (4) years and six (6) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about March 26, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

The objectives for this effort are to support DoN transformation by developing, deploying and institutionalizing LSS CPI concepts, skills, tools, and methodologies to reduce costs, decrease cycle time, and increase quality and innovation.  This unrestricted procurement will enable the DoN to become self-sufficient for sustainment through LSS CPI intellectual property and a train-the-trainer process by training civilian and military personnel.

In an effort to establish the organizational infrastructure to undertake translational clinical trials in companion animals, the CCR-COP has formed the Comparative Oncology Trial Consortium (COTC). This new drug development consortium is based on collaborative relationships with accredited schools of veterinary medicine.  The COTC will initiate trials in collaboration with NCI investigators, academic institutions, and the pharmaceutical industry.  These trials will be implemented through the collective caseloads of the COTC membership institutions with trial design, oversight, data management, and assessment of biological endpoints organized by the CCR-COP. These trials will be small in scale and will emphasize the assessment of biological questions related to drug development.  The design of these trials will answer essential questions emerging from the development plans of agents destined for human patients.  The second trial that has commenced is COTC003: The evaluation of mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin in dogs with ostesracoma.  Serum, plasma and whole blood will be collected at various times within the study protocol and will be used for pharmacokinetic analysis and immune competence assays, as well as archived for future post hoc assessments.  In order to complete the data analysis of this trial the services of Covance Laboratories are required to perform method validation and sample analysis of rapamycin in dog plasma.  Covance Laboratories is the only laboratory in the world, known to the NCI Researcher that will provide method validation and sample analysis of rapamycin in canine samples.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service they may submit a capability statement.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

TITLE:  Information Warfare: Offensive and Defensive Counterinformation

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 06-12-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 by 10 Mar 06; FY 07 by 1 May 06; FY 08 by 1 May 07 and, FY 09 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 December 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details. 

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

INFORMATION WARFARE:  AFRL/IF is soliciting white papers to identify and develop technologies to enable a distributed information infrastructure that provides all the mechanisms and services required to allow the warfighters to craft their C4I information environments, including ability to establish distributed virtual staffs, to share a common consistent perception of the battlespace, and construct distributed task teams among sensors, shooters, movers, and command posts. These technologies will be applied across the full spectrum of cyber operations, in support of Air Force mission requirements. Specific technologies include, but are not limited to: network protocols, information adaptation, network management, routing technologies, adaptive interfaces, distributed information environments, multimedia services, adaptive security services, global resource management, architectures, computer and network risk assessment/management, vulnerability assessment, assurance techniques, detection of intrusions and misuse, network security, wireless information assurance, assessment of information damage, cyber forensics, recovery of information systems and computer networks to operational levels, and a full spectrum of active response and computer network attack techniques.

Information superiority is an integral part of air and space superiority, an Air Force doctrine. This gives the commander freedom from attack, the freedom to maneuver and the freedom to attack. Information superiority is that degree of information advantage of one force over another that permits the conduct of operations at a given time and place without prohibitive opposition. Information operations are not focused exclusively on information superiority and information operations alone is not sufficient to achieve information superiority. AFRL/IF has developed a responsive R&D technology program to help the US achieve information superiority. The technology research in this BAA will be focused in the following areas of information operations: influence operations, network warfare operations and electronic warfare operations.

Influence Operations: Focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of leaders, groups, or entire populations. Influence operations employ capabilities to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate commander's intent and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in differing objectives. The military capabilities of influence operations are psychological operations, military deception, operations security, counterintelligence operations, counterpropoganda operations and public affairs operations. 

Network Warfare Operations: The integrated planning, employment, and assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital network portion of the battle space. Network warfare operations are conducted in the information domain through the combination of hardware, software, data and human interaction.  The operational activities of network warfare operations are network attack, network defense and network warfare support.

Electronic Warfare Operations: The integrated planning, employment, and assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the electromagnetic domain in support operational objectives. 

The objective of this BAA is to address highly innovative R&D areas in information operations. Proposed work should address the innovative and strategic thought of the 21st century adversary, and develop new concepts to counter with innovative information-based capabilities. Further, proposed work should address new concepts for continuously analyzing the information battle space to identify US vulnerabilities and adversary weaknesses, and develop new defensive and offensive strategies and capabilities accordingly.

There are critical technical areas of focus under this BAA which are high leverage areas to be worked in order to address the most difficult Air Force requirements, provide the Air Force with the greatest technology push possible, and surface opportunities for contributing to important national security issues such as defending information systems and countering cyber terrorism.

Network Attack: Employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, degrade, deny, delay, corrupt or usurp information resident in or transiting through networks. A primary effect is to influence the adversary commander's decisions.

Network Defense: Employment of network-based capabilities to defend friendly information resident in or transiting through networks against adversary efforts to destroy, disrupt, degrade, deny, delay, corrupt or usurp it. Actions include analyzing network activity to determine the appropriate course of action to protect, detect, and react to internal and external threats to Air Force networks.

Network Warfare Support: The collection and production of network related data for immediate decisions involving network warfare operations. Specifically, network warfare support provides profiling, event analysis, open source review, as well as pattern analysis in support of network defense and countermeasure development.

CYBERCRAFT: A Cybercraft is a trusted computer entity designed to cooperate with other Cybercraft to defend Air Force networks. For consideration, Cybercraft-related white papers must address one or more of the following fundamental Cybercraft problems: 

?	Map and Mission Context: Create a commander's strategic and operational picture of the information operations domain. 

?	Environment Description: Enable Cybercraft to describe the environment. 

?	C3 Protocols and Architecture: Define a C3 protocol and architecture to allow multiple Cybercraft to conduct coordinated operations. 

?	Formal Model and Policy: Build a formal model and policy for Cybercraft to ensure behavior conforms to a commander's intent. 

?	Trust and Self Protection Guarantee: Formulate the properties a Cybercraft must maintain for assured operations. 

?	Interfaces and Payloads: Define standard interfaces (e.g. Cybercraft-to-host, Cybercraft-to-environment, Cybercraft-to-payload, and Cybercraft-to-Cybercraft) to facilitate extensibility, evolution, and interoperability.

The recommended date for white papers for the Cybercraft technology area is by 1 May 2007.  White papers must follow the same guidelines as outlined in paragraphs IV. 1, 2 and 4.  White papers for this technology area must be addressed to ATTN: Sonja Glumich, AFRL/IFGA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441.  Reference to BAA 06-12 is also required.  Electronic submission to Sonja.Glumich@rl.af.mil is also acceptable (if submitting electronically, you do not need to follow up by sending in 5 hard copies).
 
II. AWARD INFORMATION:

These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data. However, proposals may only be submitted at the unclassified or SECRET level. Proposals submitted above this level will not be accepted or considered.

3.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<CONTACT>Camille Jones, (256) 876-3080
<DESC>This amendment is issued to re-publish subject BAA.  This re-published BAA shall remain in effect for a period of one year from date of this synopsis.  Using a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the US Army Aviation & Missile Research, Development & Engineering Center (USA AMRDEC), Applied Technology Initiatives Directorate (ATI) is interested in receiving proposals from offerors capable of satisfying Government requirements for research and development utilizing new and innova tive technologies to advance the capabilities in Applied Technology for interceptor technologies and defense infrastructure technologies. Proposals with new and innovative technologies are needed which could enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge for the following areas: Proposals should address one of the technical areas listed: A: INTERCEPTOR TECHNOLOGIES, 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Threat Negation Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling Systems, 4. Command, Control & Communications Systems, 5. Networks, 6. System Interoperability, 7. System Requirements, 8. Other Applicable Interceptor Applied Technology Systems, and B: DEFENSE INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES (AIR, CRUISE MISSILE, ARMOR, FORCE PROTECTION AND OTHER), 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Integrated Missile Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling, 4. Target Systems, 5. Transportation Systems, 6. System Operational Analysis, 7. Battle Management Systems, 8. Fire Control Systems, 9. Directed Energy Systems, 10. Other Applicable Defense Infrastructure Applied Technologies. All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25. This acquisition is not open to foreign firms. Any contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA can not have foreign nationals working on the effort. Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or national of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 1324b(a)(3). In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this summary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed. The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received. Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full technical and cost proposals. The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested. Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the USA AMRDEC. In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept paper shall be limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. All concept papers, proposals, written communications or docum entation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Briggitte Fletcher,  via e-mail briggitte.fletcher@us.army.mil, with a copy to Ms. Camille Jones, via e-mail camille.jones@us.army.mil. Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement. No classified data shall be included in the concept paper or proposal. A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated based on technical merit and offerors past performance. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation or response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract and interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. USA AMRDEC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort type contracts are expected to be awarded. For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $30M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 months. In addition to the basic contract, up to four options can be proposed. However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) for the basic and options cannot exceed $75M and the total period of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 60 months. This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal): 1. FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a one time Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, DI-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4. SOFTWARE PRODUCT SPECIFICATION (SPS), DI-IPSC-81441, as required; 5. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN (SDP), DI-IPSC-81427, as required. 6. PERIODIC PROGRAM REVIEWS (such as IPRs, SRRs, SDRs, etc.), as required. 7. DA Manpower Reporting Requirements. Long term proposals should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor category. To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. This acquisition is not open to foreign participation at any level. The Government will provide selected offerors with proposal content requirements. Proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to: (1) Statement of Work (SOW): The SOW should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract. It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement, or end product to be developed. The SOW should state the objectives to be achieve d and how these objectives would benefit the Government. These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the Research & Development and Warfighter communities at and supported by the USA AMRDEC. The SOW should also include a proposed schedule detailing significant milestones and deliverables. (2) One page Resumes of the offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience in the field of the proposer is especially important. (3) The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the USA AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by offerors for Government furnished property/equipment must be clearly identified in the proposal. The Government is under no obligation to comply with such requests. Thus, offerors should make provisions for alternate approaches in the event the Government is unwilling or unable to provide the requested property/equipment. (4) A statement regarding possible impact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment. (5) A brief description of your organization. (6) The facilities to be used for the work, if appropriate for and understanding of the proposal. (7) A listing of current similar R&D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer & technical) shall be included. The financial portion of the proposal should contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed by element of cost for meaningful evaluation and must include sufficient detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation. Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification. The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project. The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project. For proposals from universities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. (2) An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. (3) A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies. (4) Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation. Travel budgets that exceed $1,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require special investigation. (5) Other direct costs. (6) Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs. The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7) Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g. , a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional). (8) The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9) Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented  (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc). Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Subcontractin g goals for small business are 40%, for veteran owned small business 3%, for service disabled veteran owned small business 3%, Hubzone small business 3%, small disadvantaged business (includes HBCUs/MIs) 5%, and women-owned small business 5%. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted. The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22, Limitation of Funds. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Management, cost realism and reasonableness, and past performance shall also be considered. The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA. General: The government selection of the proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the areas and factors set forth below. The Government anticipates multiple awards under this announcement, though no minimum or maximum number of awards can be guaranteed. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Evaluation Factors for Technical Area: a. Overall Scientific/Technical Quality: The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development. The scientific/technical merits may include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality and uniqueness. b. Qualifications: Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of facilities and instrumentation as required. The offeror shall also be evaluated on past technical performance of current similar R&D contracts. c. Research and Development Contribution: Potential contribution of the proposed research to USA AMRDEC in the above technology areas. Evaluation Factors Management Area: a. Overall Scheduling and Planning: The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. b. Expenditure Control: The approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours. c. Past Performance: The offeror's past performance for similar work will be considered. Evaluation Factors Cost Area: a. Cost Realism: The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed. b. Total Evaluated Probable Cost: The proposal will be evaluated to develop the government's estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed. Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria: 1. Technical: The technical area is significantly more important than the management area. The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 2. Management: The management  area is significantly less important than the technical area. The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 3. Cost: Although the technical and management areas are more important than the cost area, cost is still considered a significant evaluation factor. Proposed costs must be fully detailed and have a complete justification. The total proposed cost must be within the total contract value as specified in the Introduction of this BAA. Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluatio n criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance. In some cases the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to funds availability relevant to the Applied Technology Initiatives Directorate customer goals. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369,  The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. This BAA shall remain in effect for a period of one-year from date of synopsis.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) intends to procure Agency-wide Protective Services.  This acquisition is for the management, integration, and performance of NASAís overall Protective Services at all NASA Centers.  NASA is planning to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in the third quarter of FY07.  The contemplated requirements may include the following:   1.	Security Services:  Identification Management Badging Access Control, Physical Security and  Armed Uniformed Services (firearms and canines), Resource Protection, Personnel Security Services, Education and Training,  Industrial Security, Security Investigations, Locksmith, Alarms, CCTV and Access Control Technicians; 2.	Emergency Management:  Emergency Operations Center, Incident Management, and Continuity of Operations, 911 Emergency Center Operations; 3.	Fire Services:	Fire Fighting, Paramedic Services, and Inspection and Engineering; 4.	Export Control:  Technical Transfer Reviews, Training and Awareness; and 5.	Information Assurance:	including auditing, forensics, certification and accreditation, and compliance reviews.	Note:  this contract is intended to only provide information assurance auditing and forensics for any Center that does not currently have this capability.   It is contemplated that each center will negotiate Delivery Order(s) to be issued under the Agency-wide Protective Services contract to provide  authorization for work to begin at each NASA Center.  It is also contemplated that the work will be authorized in three (3) phase-in  periods, shown as follows, but subject to change (as will be depicted in any forthcoming RFP):  The 1st	phase-in (starting October 2008) are for  the following centers:  Langley Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Goddard Space Flight Center (including Goddard Institute for Space Studies), Stennis Space Center, Glenn Research Center (including Plumbrook), Johnson Space Center (including Ellington Field, Sonny Carter/Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, and White Sands Test Facility), Kennedy Space Center, and the Independent Verification and Validation Facility (IV&V).  The 2nd phase-in (starting 2009) for centers:  Ames Research Center (Security) and Dryden Research Center.  The 3rd phase-in (starting 2010) for centers:  Jet Propulsion Laboratory (including Goldstone), NASA Headquarters, Wallops Flight Facility, and Ames Research Center (Fire Protection). NASA is seeking capabilities from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran, and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this acquisition.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran, or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto.   This requirementís NAICS code is 561612 ñ Security Guards and Patrol Services with a size standard of $11.5M annually.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offerorís responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This sources sought synopsis is for informational and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirements.  You are requested to provide your capabilities statement response (20-page maximum including attachments) via e-mail to the primary Point of Contact (POC), listed below.  Your response is required not later than March 22, 2007.  To facilitate a prompt review by the NASA team, a one-page summary shall be included with your capability statement(s), which shall identify your companyís specific capabilities that are relevant (and reflect the magnitude) to these requirements.  You are requested to specify your interest in this acquisition as being a potential Prime contractor or Subcontractor.  You are also requested to provide your companyís name, address, primary POC and telephone number, companyís average annual revenues for the past three years, total number of employees, and your Government size standard/type classification (Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran, HUBZone, business, or Historically Black Colleges and Universities) on the summary page.  The summary page will not count against the maximum page limit.  It is insufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information.   NOTICE:  Copies of your capability statement(s) should not contain company-sensitive information.  NASA is also interested in contractor feedback related to suggestions for contract type and subcontracting opportunities, given the possibility that the total requirements may be competed on an unrestricted basis.  This feedback would be used as research information to support the analysis and development of subcontracting goals and potential teaming arrangements.  This feedback should also be provided electronically via e-mail to the primary POC by March 22, 2007.  General information about this requirement can be found on the World Wide Web at:  http://nps.ksc.nasa.gov/NPS/default.cfm       .  Any questions you may have are to be submitted in writing to the POC listed below to be used for consideration in the development of the requirements and/or to be answered and posted to this acquisitionís website.   Point of Contacts are:	Dawn Alexander, Lead Contracting Officer or Teri Osabutey.   E-Mail: ps-seb@mail.nasa.gov.  Please copy and paste the e-mail address into your web browser.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks information as to potential qualified small businesses and other sources with specific experience and expertise to provide for the design, engineering, fielding, testing, certification/accreditation, and operational support of an enterprise-level, Protection Level 5 (PL-5) multi-level security, thin client environment, including full system and user documentation.  The system design shall allow for simultaneous access to multiple security enclaves (SBU, Secret, Top Secret and SCI) and provide the capability for sharing information across security enclaves.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided to requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

   DTRA is a combat support and defense agency, charged with the vital national security mission of reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA is the principal source for the warfighter and other organizations to understand and plan against WMD threats. The agency supports the three pillars of the National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction:  nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and consequence management. Moreover, DTRA has been recently designated to form and lead U.S. Strategic Command?s (USSTRATCOM) Center for Combating WMD in direct support of that command?s mission to integrate and synchronize DoD in combating WMD across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Leadership, Materiel, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTLMPF) spectrum.

   In order to more efficiently support the various elements of DTRA's mission and to reduce IT support costs, the Office of the CIO (OCIO) is considering implementing a multi-level security solution to integrate four primary security domains, Unclassified, Collateral Secret, Collateral Top Secret, and Top Secret/SCI.  Candidate solutions should provide for simultaneous access to multiple domains and enclaves via a single ultra-thin client workstation.  Additionally, the candidate solution must be able to support and interface additional networks and enclaves within the above classification structure, such as, but not limited to, the Non-classified Internet Protocol Routable Network (NIPRNet), the Secret Internet Protocol Routable Network (SIPRNet), the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIX), Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), Combined Federated Battle Laboratories (CFBL) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications Systems (JWICS).  

   Upon Final Operational Capability (FOC), the proposed solution shall provide the capability to transfer data (e.g. text, Microsoft office documents) across domains from low to high (i.e. from SBU to Secret, and from Secret to Top Secret/SCI) and support a releasing process to transfer information from high-to-low security domains.  Candidate solutions shall be certified to be in compliance with PL-5 architecture requirements as detailed in the Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/3 (DCID 6/3). 

Scope of Effort:

   The multi-level security thin client solution will be implemented at the Defense Threat Reduction Center (DTRC), located in the National Capitol Region on the Fort Belvoir Military Reservation.  An enterprise-level implementation may require up to 2000 thin client workstations.  Access to JWICS thin-client workstations shall be limited to SCIF areas.  

   Plans for this effort include implementation of a PL-5 certified pilot system with Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in late calendar year 2007.  Pending successful completion of the pilot phase, full implementation will begin to include migration across the entire enterprise and implementation of low to high information gateways.  Final Operational Capability (FOC) is anticipated to occur late calendar year 2008.

Notional tasks the source must be able to execute include:
- Site survey to include discovery;
- System design;
- Purchase of required equipment, software and associated support licenses;
- System testing;
- System implementation;
- Full certification and accreditation support to include management of Secret and Below Interoperability (SABI) and Top Secret and Below Interoperability (TSABI) processes;
- User and administrator training;
- On-site engineering and technical support (contract option following FOC); and,
- Full system documentation to include configuration management, drawings, certification and accreditation documentation, and end-user and system administrator usage, configuration and configuration guides.

Mandatory Requirements:

Responsible sources should demonstrate:
- Proven experience in design and fielding of PL-4 and PL-5 certified enterprise-wide multi-level security architectures similar in scope and complexity to the proposed effort;
- IPv6 compliance status of potential solution;
- Ability to integrate Common Access Card (CAC) authentication for authentication, encryption and non-repudiation;
- Ability to provide proven security certification and accreditation support capabilities from cradle to grave (including: SABI and TSABI process management; DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP)/ DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) accreditation process support and documentation; DoD Intelligence Information System (DODIIS) accreditation process support and documentation; and Cross Domain System Management Office coordination);
- Mature project management, system engineering and design, configuration management, quality assurance and system support processes;
- Intrinsic staffing resources sufficient to field a project similar in scope and complexity to the proposed effort, including personnel with all requisite security clearances and information assurance certifications in accordance with DoD Directive 8570.1;
- Capability to provide on-site engineering support services during development and after system implementation; and,
- Ability to deliver end-user and system administration training and support.

   DTRA's intent is to award a single award cost plus fixed fee contract.  Any prospective small business awardee must perform 51% of the required effort.  The performance period is anticipated to be from May 2007 through May 2009.  On-site engineering and service support and training support may be included as contract options following FOC.  This SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP); it is a market research tool being used to determine the availability, business size and existing contractual vehicles of qualified experienced sources prior to issuing an RFP.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this synopsis is strictly voluntary.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The ICE Academy and field offices have a requirement for pistol cleaning kits. These cleaning kits are necessary to keep the firearms operational and safe. Currently, the NFTTU supplies two separate pistol cleaning kits: a 9mm kit and a .40cal kit. It has been determined that combining the two kits into one universal kit would be more efficient and less expensive than maintaining two different kits with very little difference in the contents. Therefore, the NFTTU has drafted the acceptable kit content requirements, as set forth below.


DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS OF UNIVERSAL CLEANING KIT

A. The following descriptions and specifications are for a ?universal? cleaning kit for 1.  .40 Smith & Wesson, and a 9mm caliber pistol.
a. Estimated usage for pistol cleaning kits: 2000 per year

	1 each, steel rod with handle
	1 each stainless steel or brass slotted patch holder
	2 each phosphor bronze bristle .40cal AND 9mm bore brushes (4 brushes total)
	1 each nylon bristle ?tooth? brush
	1 each 2FL (fluid once) plastic bottle commercially      available cleaner
	Lubricant/protectant (CLP) for firearms (see below)
	50 each cotton flannel cleaning patches
	1 each storage pouch imprinted with ?NFTTU? emblem

C. Cleaning kit specifications

	1. Pistol cleaning rod shall be of steel, 6-1/2 inches long, plus or minus ? inch, not including handle. It shall be the correct diameter to easily move through the barrels of a .40cal S&W and 9mm. Internal features as follows:

a. A handle, which incorporates ball bearings or similar, to allow for free rotation of the rod, will be permanently affixed to one end.
b. Commercially available firearms cleaning solvents shall not damage the handle material or rod itself.
c. The rod shall have sufficient lateral strength to withstand without damage to the rod, handle or bearings, a pressure of 20 pounds placed on the center of the rod while the rod is supported horizontally by ? inch of its tip and the handle.

2. Slotted stainless or brass patch holder shall be threaded to match appropriate rod, as described above.

3. Bore bristles, phosphor bronze brushes: bristle area approximately 1 ? inch in length, threaded to match appropriate rod, as described above.

4. Cleaning brush (toothbrush style) to be approximately 7 inches long, nylon or polypropylene, with nylon bristles on both ends, multiple rows (approx. 3/8 inch long) on one end, single row (approx. 3/16 inch long on other end). Entire brush to be resistant to firearms cleaning solvents.

5. Cleaner/lubricant/protectant, 2oz plastic bottle with nipple shaped dispenser, manufactured by Break Free, CLP or Formula 3 Gun Conditioner by Kleen-Bore, or equal.

6. Cleaning patches (50 each) approximately  2 ? inches square, .020-.030 inch thick, white, 100% cotton flannel, for use on a .40 cal or 9mm firearm.

7. Storage container, using either a zippered or Velcro closure, to be a durable canvas or nylon pouch with permanent compartments that separate cleaner/lubricant from brushes, patch holder, patches, cleaning rods and brushes. All components of each cleaning kit shall fit conformability, so as to be easily removed and replaced. However, it is the Government?s desire that the storage container be as compact as possible. Storage container shall be black and imprinted in white with DHS/NFTTU emblem using permanent marking material.

<DESC>Description:  The U.S. General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service, on behalf of the Indian Health Service Division of Oral Health, Rockville, Maryland intends to award a contract for the following described effort.  The Government intends to award a contract with a brand name component (DXONE/Dentrix Enterprise Solution, Henry Schein?).  This sources sought is not for the specific contract, it is for the brand name component of the contract.

Background:  The Indian Health Service (IHS) Division of Oral Health (DOH) currently uses the Dental Data System (DDS) module of the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) to support the DOH clinical and front office needs in over 300 dental clinics nationwide. As an integrated module of the RPMS, DDS can exchange data with other integrated modules within RPMS such as Patient Registration, the Patient Care Component, and others.  The RPMS/DDS currently meets approximately 40 per cent of the technical and functional requirements identified by the DOH. The RPMS/DDS has no graphic user interface and has not been upgraded or enhanced since the mid 1990s.  The RPMS/DDS cannot capture or store digital radiographs or other digital images.  

Objectives:  At the conclusion of this task, the IHS/DOH will have a current, state-of-the-art, automated electronic dental record that will be used to support the clinical, practice management, program planning and evaluation, and reporting needs for the DOH. The new system will provide automated patient dental records and capture dental data from patient encounters and oral examination records to support quality assurance, utilization reviews, resource allocation, clinical measures, and research. The new system will be able to incorporate digital radiographs and other digital images into the electronic dental record.  Additionally, the new system will interface with the RPMS information system to retrieve, report, and update data from RPMS. The new system will replace the existing RPMS/DDS.
As part of a previous effort, the IHS/DOH has developed and tested three (3) interfaces with the RPMS.  Those interfaces are an initial load of patient registration demographic data, a patient registration add/edit interface, and a dental visit interface to the Patient Care Component of RPMS.  These interfaces were developed to exchange data specifically with the DXONE/Dentrix Enterprise Solution (Henry Schein?). The intent of this sources sought to ascertain whether there are any other solutions/software other than Dentrix that can specifically communicate with the already established HIS/RPMS interfaces.
Contractors shall address the following:  
1. In order to avoid any duplication of effort or additional cost to the Government, the contractor must demonstrate access to the proprietary DXONE/Dentrix Enterprise Solution and the DXONE interfaces that are specific to the IHS/RPMS.
2.  The contractor shall also demonstrate the capability to provide the following program management support:
?	Overseeing the performance of the DXONE/Dentrix Enterprise Solution during testing, installation, and operation 
?	Assisting the IHS Project Management Team in managing the nationwide program implementation of the DXONE/Dentrix Enterprise Solution to dental (Tribal and non-Tribal) sites
?	Performing the certification and accreditation (C&A) of the DXONE/Dentrix Enterprise Solution
?	Performing independent, end-to-end testing of the interfaces between the DXONE/Dentrix Enterprise Solution and RPMS
?	Analyzing work flow, procedures, and documents and suggesting improvements to current operations at clinics where the DXONE/Dentrix Enterprise Solution will be implemented as well as assisting IHS in assessing dental clinic performance following the installation of the solution, based on performance measures that have been identified by the IHS
?	Developing and executing the Installation and Acceptance (I&A) Test Plan to ensure the readiness of each site before it goes live

Respondents are requested to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to perform the requirements in paragraph 1 and 2 above.  SOCs are limited to a total of five (5) pages.  Submit responses electronically to george.chiarchiaro@ihs.gov and anthony.r.trujillo@ gsa.gov, no later the 15 calendar days (March 23, 2007) after the date of this announcement by 5:00 PM, Mountain Daylight Saving Time.

<SUBJECT>81 -- 200 GLASS FLASKS SEALED WITH TEFLON O-RING STOPCOCKS
<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Global Monitoring Division (GMD)  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Allen Scientific Glass Inc., to provide a quantity of 200 air sampling flasks.  GMD operates a global air sampling network to measure the distribution and variations of climatically important trace gases (CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, SF6) and stable isotopic ratios (13C/12C, 18O/16O).  Whole air samples are collected in glass flasks sealed by means of Teflon O-ring stopcocks.  Because these gases are long-lived and well-mixed in the atmosphere, the spatial and temporal variations are relatively small.  This requires that the measurements be extremely accurate and precise, on the order of 0.03% for CO2.  To obtain the needed levels of accuracy and precision, the air sample composition must not change (gain or loss of any trace gas molecules) during storage in the flasks over time.  Any changes in the materials or methods used in our measurements require time-consuming testing to insure that artifacts or offsets are not introduced into the existing long time series.  Subtle artifacts could lead to erroneous interpretation of the data.  Flasks from other manufacturers have been tested and fail to meet our stability requirements, leaving ASG as the only source for this purchase.  The flasks shall be 2.5 liters in size with Glass Expansion, Ltd. (GE) Teflon O-ring stopcocks.  The flasks must meet the following stability requirements over a 2 month storage period:  
1.	CO2 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.07 ppm; 
2.	CH4 the maximum allowed deviation is 2.0 ppb; 
3.	CO the maximum allowed deviation is 1 ppb; 
4.	H2 the maximum allowed deviation is 10 ppb; 
5.	N2O the maximum allowed deviation is 0.4 ppb; 
6.	SF6 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.06 ppt; 
7.	13C/12C the maximum allowed deviation is 0.01 per mil (parts per thousand);
8.	180/160 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.05 per mil.  
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE 100K).  No solicitation is planned. This synopsis is issued for information only.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

The CAB will also emphasize education and training  in emerging biotechnology specialties that could contribute to future Army needs and requirements.  The CAB will serve as the Armys trusted agent in carrying out the activities and tasking required to realize the above objectives.  One of the major objec tives of the CAB is to develop a laboratory facility to conduct test and evaluation of technologies that are of interest to the Army and other Government agencies.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

 	It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.   Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from vendors. 

1.  Do you have a manufacture to reference for the Model ST-3T Hydrostatic Tractor?
   -The government is not seeking a specific manufacturer for the item.  It is the up to the vendor to submit a solution that meets the listed requirements.  

2.   Are you able to provide the job application and/or use characteristic for this tractor?
    -This is a specialized piece of equipment that will be used in and around the urban interface during wildland and prescribed fire events because it has the capability of traversing wetter areas as opposed to our 4 wheel drive engines. The machine will be equipped with a 300/400 gallon water tank with specialized hand tools, etc.  The machine should be capable of working in areas that require a lower ground pressure than your typical wildland equipment.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to RFP H92222-07-R-0055, UHF High Gain SATCOM Antenna is as follows:  1) Delete CLIN 1007 as described/stated in Amendment 5; 2) Add the following revised CLIN 1007 description: CLIN 1007 Technical Data (Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL)), Not Separately Priced (NSP), CDRL A001 ? Commercial Off The Shelf Manuals.  For proposal purposes, the Government will provide CDRL A001 (electronic version)to the Offeror, upon request.  The Contractor shall provide COTS manuals with each antenna (1:1 ratio). All CDRLs are electronic submission; and 3) Post the Questions/Answers for the UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas (RFP H9222207R0055) solicitation. Questions and Government Responses are as follows: Question 1: CLINs 1007 through 5007 require pricing for CDLS with maximum quantities stated for each year. We understand this to be the Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), as described in section 3.0 of the SOW. The SOW describes this as all qualified labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, appliances and services to repair the antennas at the contractor's facility and ship the antannas back to the government. It further requires the contractor to obtain Government authorization prior to beginning any repair on an antenna, and to provide to the Government a written estimate of the repairs, including the cost of materials and labor required for the repair. Depending on the nature of the damage to be repaired, this cost could cover a very wide range, from a minimal action to repairs costing  up to 65% of the value of a new antenna. Therefore, it is difficult to make a estimate of the cost of an average repair for each CLIN. Any clarification or guidance the Government may be able to provide will be appreciated. Response 1: The Government intends to amend the solicitation to delete the Contractor Depot Logistics Support. Question 2: The SOW only establishes the technical requirements and repair of the antennas, not the new procurement requirement.
Do you think that paragraph 1.0 of the SOW should be more specific by mentioning procurement also? Response 2: The intent of the combined synopsis/solicitation is to define the Government's UHF High Gain Antenna procurement requirements (in a streamlined approach) in the solicitation document posted on 19 Dec 06.  This solicitation document provides the procurement requirements for this effort. The SOW included in the solicitation is exclusive to defining the UHF High Gain Antenna specifications/requirements only. Question 3:  It is uncertain as to what data should be supplied under CLIN 1007 of solicitation H9222-07-R-0055. Since the product repair and support sections of the SOW have been deleted, it might include illustrated parts breakdown drawings, to facilitate replacement parts ordering. Could you tell us exactly what will be required? Response 3: CLIN 1007 shall apply to Commercial Off The Shelf Manuals, CDRL A001 (this was CDRL A002, but revised as a result of the deletion of CDLS.  The contractor shall provide COTS manuals with each antenna (1:1 ratio). Question 4: There is a user manual for each of our COTS antennas. It contains operator's instructions and also lists the parts available for field repairs and where they can be obtained. Will this meet the requirements of CLIN 1007? Response 4: Yes, the user manual for each of your COTS antennas (as described) will meet the requirements of CLIN 1007.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to RFP H92222-07-R-0055 is to post the Questions/Answers for the UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas (RFP H9222207R0055) solicitation. Questions and Government Responses are as follows: 1.  The EDO DMC125 product is usually sold as a system, P/N SE78- 2-2.  The system consists of:  C125-2 antenna, tripod, case, and a 12 foot cable.  Does USSOCOM need the complete system?  Does USSOCOM require the 3 foot and 8 foot cable also or is this just for the Trivec-Avant (or Equal) items?
Response:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial off the shelf (COTS) items for Ultra High Frequency (UHF) High Gain Satellite Antennas.  For Contract Line Items (CLINs)  1001-5001, 1002-5002, 1003-5003, 1004-5004, 1005-5005, and 1006-5006, the Offerors shall propose their complete COTS system(s).  The purpose of the RF Coaxial Cable CLINs is for the Government to purchase different lengths of RF Coaxial cables as needed.  The Offerors are highly encouraged to propose RF Coaxial Cables (CLINs 1009-5009, 1010-5010, 1011-5011, 1012-5012, and 1013-5013) applicable to any proposed antenna(s).  The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the Offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.  2.  Please confirm the SATCOM radio interface connector is a type N female so that our BNC male to type N male cable will satisfy your requirement.  Response:  The SATCOM radio interface connector on the AN/PSC-5D radio is a BNC Female.    3.  The Statement of Work, Requirements, paragraph 2.5 refers to high and low angle modes for the AV 2091-2 (or equal).  The AV 2091-2 (or equal) is a single port antenna with right hand circular polarization minimum gain of +6 dBi at the zenith and incidental vertical/linear gain at other angles with no explicitly separate modes.  What is the intent of high and low angle modes for this antenna?  Response:  The intent of the high and low angle (elevation) modes for SATCOM on the Move (SOTM) is to identify the gain measurements for the antenna(s) in both angles given the proximity of the satellite to the radio.  When the satellite is close to or near to the horizon, the antenna performance will be less than if the satellite is at zenith.  The ability to operate a radio in different modes when the satellite is near the horizon may depend in part on several variables to include the gain to the antenna.

If the two (2) cables, 8 ft and 12 ft, in the AV-2012 system replace the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV-2040-2? d. In the SOW at paragraph 2.4, the two (2) cables (8 ft and 12 ft) replace the 6 ft. cable normally supplied with TAC AV-2055-3.  This will increase the weight of the system by 0.5 lbs to 3.5 lbs.  If the two (2) cables, 8 ft and 12 ft, in the AV-2055-3 system replace the two (2) 12.5ft cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV2055-3?  Government Response:  The solicitation will be amended to identify five (5) additional and separate CLINs for the Coaxial RF cables:  3 ft,  8 ft, 12 ft, 25 ft, and 150 ft.  The Statement of Work will identify the commercial requirements for the systems without the additional cable replacements.  2.  Would the above changes be considered as exceptions to the Government?s technical requirements? Government Response:  No.  As stated above, the solicitation will be amended to add five (5) additional and separate CLINs for the five (5) Coaxial RF cables (3 ft, 8 ft, 12 ft, 25 ft and 150 ft.).  3.  For forward pricing matters, please clarify whether the Government has an expected award date that the bidder should use to define its contract years, or shall the bidder simply assume a reasonable "Contract Year" starting date, such as 01 Jun 2007? Government Response:  FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items,(10)(c), "Period for acceptance of offers.  The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation."

HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 30) CLAUSES

3052.209-70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percentí for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

ìPerson", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 


(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

(i) warrants;

(ii) options;

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

(v) others similar interests.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
