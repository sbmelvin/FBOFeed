(APR 2004)
(a)	This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103.  An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.

(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4). 
(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override. 
(2)	The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing.  A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.<BR><BR>Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.(3)	The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program.  Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice.  The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action.  In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start.  This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO.  Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.

(d)	An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. 
(e)	For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.  The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority.  
(f)	An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief.  All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest.
(g)	Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from :Mr Vokt, Eric S.(Contracting Officer),( DIRECTOR OF CONTRACTING- DUGWAY, UT 84022) PH.# 435-8312107, FAX# 435-831-2085.

Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

www.section508.gov
 
www.access-board.gov
 
Do you have questions about Section 508? Do you need information on applying Section 508 to your EIT procurement?  Contact Sheilah Lynch, 301-827-9372 or by email at Sheilah.Lynch@fda.hhs.gov

<DESC>****************************ONLY Contact Betsy Anderson/DFS for this Synopsis atElizabeth.s.anderson@nasa.gov or via fax at 256-544-4401***************************************************NASA/MSFC has a requirement for FOAMAT Qualification system.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Eurotech Distributors, Inc on a sole sourcebasis for the following reasons:1.	The Thermal Protection System (TPS) development efforts at MSFC require that anautomated system be utilized for the uniform measurement of physical parameters ofcryogenic insulation materials.  Personnel involved in this effort are experienced withthe use of older versions of the FOAMAT foam testing equipment.  2.	FOAMAT Foam testing equipment is currently being utilized at MSFC to study theperformance of cryogenic insulation systems. Cross functionality of MSFC personnel, aswell as continuity of the information base-line will be enhanced through the use of thesame manufacturer of laboratory testing equipment in multiple locations.  3.	Baseline processes developed with existing FOAMAT equipment at MSFC facilitieswill be utilized to assist with the development of replacement materials and processes. The utilization of similar systems will reduce the variation of these comparisons,reducing the amount of effort needed to ensure comparable results, and thereby reducingthe overall cost of this effort.4.	Eurotech Distributors, Inc. is the exclusive supplier of the FOAMAT equipmentfor the North America market.5.	An internet search of foam qualification equipment revealed only the FOAMATequipment being utilized for the intended purpose.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to Betsy Anderson/DFS no later than 12:00 p.m. CST on 08/11/2008.

<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) ona sole source basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source,to the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado,Boulder. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as part of its operationalclimate responsibility to fill the solar irradiance data gap between the Glory missionand NPOESS C2 planned for launch in 2016, intends to deploy the TSIS on the NPOESS C1mission to be launched in early 2013.  TSIS consists of two instruments:  the TotalIrradiance Monitor (TIM) and the Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) and an integralpointing system. TSIS on the NPOESS C1 mission will continue the key climate measurementof Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and Spectral Solar Irradiance (SSI), which are currentlybeing measured by TIM and SIM on the SORCE mission launched in January 2003 and by TIM onthe Glory mission to be launched in June 2009.	NOAA has transferred the responsibilityand the funding to NASA to manage the development and delivery of the TSIS to the MissionSystem Contractor for the NPOESS C1 Mission.The fundamental requirement for TSIS on NPOESS C1 is to make precise and accuratemeasurements of TSI and SSI and connect them to previous TSI and SSI measurements to forma long-term climate record.  The TSI measurements shall have an absolute accuracy of0.01% (100 parts per million) based on Solar Irradiance (SI) units and shall have arelative accuracy of 0.001% per year.  The SIM requirement is to make SSI measurementswith a combined standard uncertainty of less than 0.1% and a long-term relative accuracyof 0.03%. The above high level requirements flow into specific instrument requirements.  The NPOESSC1 TSIS must be sensitive over the entire solar spectral range up to extreme wavelengthsthat contribute less than the 100 ppm requirement for absolute and 300 ppm for spectralirradiance measurements.  The NPOESS C1 TSIS instruments must be absolute radiometers asopposed to relative radiometers.  This means that a system to reduce 1/f noise must beincluded. An absolute radiometer has an internal absolute calibration source capable offully establishing the measurement scale.  The radiometric detectors must be absorbing to a level of reflectance less than 0.02 %.   The TSISsupplier is required to deliver a Level 1 science analysis system together with theinstrument.  TSIS measurements must be traceable to The National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST) and other international irradiance standards, as well as to theSORCE and Glory TIM and the SORCE SIM instruments.  Since the NPOESS C1 spacecraft willbe nadir pointing, similar to the Glory spacecraft, and the TSIS must point to the sun,it is required that the TSIS include a solar pointing platform.  All requirements must bemet by the integrated instruments/pointing platform combination.It is the opinion of NASA that only LASP has the facilities and expertise, through theirwork on the SORCE and Glory missions, to perform the technical requirements of thisprocurement within the defined schedule.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to performthe effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. localtime on    2008.

<DESC>Solicitation 8108-19 seeks On Call (OC) flight services consisting of small (not more than 7,000 pounds approved gross weight), turbine engine, three-passenger seat helicopters to support Department of the Interior, (DOI) bureaus and offices in their transport needs within Hawaii and the Commonwealth Areas of the Pacific.  Contractor services include provisions of small helicopters, pilot(s), fuel, aircraft maintenance support, and all other associated equipment, as prescribed in the Government's solicitation.  Mission activities are for fire management programs, Aerial Capture, Eradication and Tagging of Animals (ACETA), Short-haul and other related resource support and administrative activities.  Contractor(s) must possess a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificate issued under 14 CFR Part 135, 133 and 137.   Aircraft offered must also be carried on the Contractor's list required by 14 CFR Part 135.63 or Operations Specifications Part D, "Aircraft Listing," as appropriate.  The contract period will be from the date of award through September 30, 2009 for the first year, with two option periods that may be exercised at the unilateral discretion of the Government.  Multiple awards are expected to be made.  SPECIAL NOTICE.  THE DOI IS IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING CHANGES ON HOW THEY ACQUIRE SOME AIRCRAFT SERVICES.  A DOI CALL-WHEN-NEEDED (CWN) PROGRAM IS BEING DEVELOPED THAT ENCOMPASSES SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ON CALL (OC) CONTRACTS TO SUPPORT DOI AVIATION PROGRAM NEEDS AND MISSIONS.  THIS SOLICITATION IS ONE OF THOSE ON CALL CONTRACTS. WILDLAND FIRE SUPPORT, ACETA, AND SHORT-HAUL APPROVED SMALL HELICOPTERS WILL NO LONGER BE APPROVED OR UTILIZED UNDER A DOI, AIRCRAFT RENTAL AGREEMENT (ARA) AND MUST BE UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE USE OR ON CALL (OC) CONTRACT IF THE OPERATOR WISHES TO DO BUSINESS WITH DOI FOR THESE ACTIVITIES.  This is the only planned OC small helicopter solicitation that is planned for issuance for the next three years requirements.   If you operate these types of aircraft and are interested in continuing your support to the DOI under DOI procurement systems, you will need to submit a proposal as provided herein and be awarded a contract from the solicitation.  If an individual aviation vendor holds a DOI ARA and the same services can be provided via the on-call helicopter contract, the ARA may be cancelled.  We plan on eliminating duplicate procurements when possible.  It is a requirement that any successful awardee must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award being made.  It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure registration is accurate and valid.  Solicitation information will be available through the FedBizOpps site by searching for 8108-19 and at http://amd.nbc.gov.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns. The anticipated issue date of the solicitation is August 1, 2008 with a closing date of August 18, 2008. AFTER READING THE SOLICITATION, questions may be directed to Caroline Wallace, 907-271-4788, or email-Caroline_Wallace@nbc.gov

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes an FEI Nova NanoLab 600 DualBeam system.  NIST requires an upgrade to the existing instrument control system.  The upgrade will enable better milling precision than the previous system as well as is required for future upgrades such as automated Slice & View & EDS needed for the IMS projects such as 3D Chemical Imaging and Fate of Nanoparticles in Biosystems.  The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to FEI.  The upgrade must be 100 percent hardware and software compatible with the existing FEI Nova NanoLab system.  FEI is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the upgrade that is required to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 19, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Janis Research Company, Inc., Wilmington, MA, for the purchase of a Model SHI-950T Top-loading Closed-cycle Refrigerator.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in 

(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or

(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  Janis Research Company is the manufacturer of a family of five top-loading closed-cycle refrigerators (CCRs) used for neutron scattering experiments at the NIST Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  These CCRs were acquired through two openly competed procurements (awards SB1341-03-W-1159 and SB1341-06-N-1317).  This CCR family shares a modular design that enables the use of interchangeable configuration kits to adapt to the particular facility interfaces specific to different neutron scattering instruments.  In ths family of CCRs, the government has invested the following:  interchangeable sample sticks, special purpose configuration kits, and spare parts.  A portion of this investment is in a spare coldhead to minimize downtime for maintenance, plus additional sample sticks and cables.  These CCRs have proven to be an integral part of the sample environment fleet used at the NCNR.  Their versatility has made accessible a very wide temperature range along with numerous options for special experimental conditions such as high pressure, high voltage, gas loading, and relative humidity.  This is a follow-on contract to expand this family by the procurement of one CCR for use on a specialized neutron scattering instrument at the NCNR.

In order to maintain consistency and compatibility with the Divisions existing neutron scattering instrument, the Center requires an additional closed-cycle refrigerator (CCR).  Janice Research Company, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the CCR that is required to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 19, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement  to procure network data analysis service from Iknow Inc., 721 Roslyn Terrace, Evanston, IL  60201.  In the context of this project the contractor is to process and analyze all diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) data that were acquired by the various centers during the course of the study.  This work is critically dependent on the development of mathematical theories to process and interpret such imaging data.  Previously we have developed methods to detect and remedy imaging artifacts.  At this stage two main goals still need to be accomplished: 1) consolidate all image processing code into a well integrated user friendly software package.  2) develop new methods to register maps of the derived DT-MRI quantities so that they can be compared among subjects.  Contractor must be familiar with the imaging sciences and image processing methods, particularly pattern recognition, image segmentation, volume rendering, and image registration.  The contractor must have performed scientific research in the area of diffusion tensor MRI. A Masters of Science level in Mathematics or Computer Sciences is a minimum requirement.  It is particularly important that the contractor is facile in programming and using several imaging processing environments, such as IDL, C, MatLab, Java and ltk.  Responsible vendors that are capable of providing NICHD with this service may request a copy of the RFQ in writing or by FAX to 301-480-8501 to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  It is anticipated that RFQ NIHDK2008102 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  Quotations must be submitted in writing to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 6707 Democracy Blvd., Room 774B, Bethesda, Maryland 20817 Attention:  V.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The USGS, Vancouver, WA, requires two,  real time, high-rate GPS processing software site licenses.  The specifications are:The software will provide precise real-time and post-processed estimates of GPS positions at each observation epoch (data rate up to 10Hz) and, where appropriate, estimates of phase ambiguities, receiver and satellite clock corrections, and ionospheric and tropospheric biases. Single-epoch high dynamic range position solutions must be produced.  Filtered low-noise and low-dynamic-range solutions are desirable, but not required.There will be no arbitrary limit on the number of stations processed by a single computer at a single processing center, nor on the number of processes that can be run on a single computer.The software must be capable of calculating ambiguity-fixed "network" (relative position) solutions using suitable combinations of the user-specified double-difference single or dual-frequency phase (e.g., L1, L2, L3, L5) and code observables from a large number of stations (>20), and precise point positions (PPP) using undifferenced L3 (ionospheric-free linear combination of L1 and L2) observations from a large number of stations (>30) along with external (e.g., IGS real-time) and internal (input from separate run or as part of current run) estimates of satellite orbits and clocks.In networks with mixed single- and dual-frequency receivers, the option of computing ionospheric corrections from the dual-frequency stations will be available to improve the precision of the single-frequency position solutions. In network/double-difference mode with high-quality data, a high-percentage of the integer ambiguities of the GPS carrier wave must be correctly resolved for inter-station distances of less than 50 KM.Software must be capable of tracking rapid large (~1 m) and small (15mm) antenna offsets, such as those found in data from a USGS experiment available at: ftp://ehzftp.wr.usgs.gov/langbein/LVexp. Some results are given in an USGS Open File report found at: http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2006/1235; pages 14 to 25. The software must be able to read and process in real-time data streamed over the internet from Trimble 4100, 4700, 5700, R7, and NetRS GPS receivers (RT17, or BINEX (?) formats). The software must be able to read and process in real-time data streamed from Ashtech Z-XII, Z-FX, micro-Z receivers. Remote software on a download computer could be used to capture and stream data to the processing computer.The software must be able to read and process in real-time GPS data streamed over the internet with the Ntrip software. It must be possible to configure and run the software from the command line (to allow shell-type scripting).Output of positions and other estimated parameters will be available in ASCII format. In addition, web accessible plots of positions are desirable but not required. For reliable real-time streams of data, software must be capable continuously processing 1s data from up to 30(?) sites with a standard, modern, desktop computer (either with UNIX/Linux, Windows, or MacIntosh operating  systems).  For real-time processing, the software must not require additional hardware at the GPS sites (other than a telemetry or internet connection).The RFQ will be made available to interested parties through email by contacting the Contracting Officer at sevans@usgs.gov, providing mailing address, contact information, and email address not later than 8 August 2008.  All responsible sources may submit a quote.  Quotations are due by the close of business 15 August 2008. Technical data must be submitted with the quoteThe associated NAICS is 541512, Computer Systems Design Services, with an associated size standard of $6.5 Million. This notice and any resulting solicitation or purchase order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-26, effective 12 June 2008.

Evaluation Process: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. Technical Capability and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than Price. 1. Technical Capability. Explain how your company will meet the scope of work in the statement of Work. NOTE: Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient. Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating. 2. Past Performance. Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires from Two (2) firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment. Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote. If an Offeror provides more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision. It is the offerors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnaires directly to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office (see below) by the solicitation closing sate and time., the Contracting Officer may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government.

Price. 4. Award will be all or none basis. Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria: 1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability. Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2. The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price related factors. In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors. 3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance. Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium. The Trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror. Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 with their offer.

<DESC>HSCG87-08-B-643406  Repair Heating Systems at U.S. Coast Guard Housing, Homer, Alaska. The intent of this project is to repair the heating systems in four housing buildings at the United States Coast Guard Housing Area in Homer, Alaska.  Each of the four housing buildings has two ground-floor units where work will occur; eight units in total will be repaired.  The current heating system is a single-loop, boiler heated, hot water fin tube hydronic system.  Each unit has an independent loop controlled by a single thermostat.  The loop is fed from a central boiler room via copper tubing imbedded in the concrete slab-on-grade floor.  The imbedded piping has begun to show signs of failure and will be replaced with in-wall piping.  Work includes: installing a new in-wall piping heating loop in each housing unit (standard wood frame exterior walls and furred out foundation walls); disconnecting the existing fin tube heaters from the in-slab loop and connecting them to the new in-wall loop; replacing the covers for the existing fin tube heaters; converting the existing heating water system to a glycol system; patching all areas of demolition; and painting and finishing to match existing conditions.  Each unit has a bedroom with an improperly sized fin tube heater; each of these shall be replaced with a new, larger fin tube heater and new cover. In 3 of the units, temporary repair piping has been mounted on the unit walls.  This shall be demolished and disposed of.  The estimated start work date is early to mid-October 2008, with a performance period of 90 calendar days.  The estimated cost range is between $100,000 and $250,000.  See the solicitation for bonding requirements.  Award of this project is contingent upon availability of funding.  This project is being advertised as a 4th fiscal quarter FY2008 project with award anticipated prior to 9/30/08 if sufficient funding is available.

The North American Industry Classification Code is 541519. The targeted number of awards is 4 large business and 4 small business.  It is the responsibility of the prospective contractors to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.

The Scope of Work is divided into 2 Service Areas where the period of performance for the multiple award Service Area One is a base year with 4 one year options.  This area may use award terms on task orders and would include the 6 month option to extend services clause.   Service Area Two is to be a single award with a base period of 1 year and 4 one year options, also with the 6 month option to extend services clause. This service area is a follow-on to the current Intelligence Information, Command & Control, Equipment & Enhancements (ICE2) contract.  The overall SITE Program ceiling is $6.6B. 

The purpose of the SITE contract is to satisfy the information technology (IT) requirements for the Department of Defense (DoD) Intelligence Community, and would allow for external ordering of IT by other DoD IC agencies. The Virginia Contracting Activity (VACA) recognizes that no single contractor may be capable of providing the full range of goods and services called for under this contract. Therefore, the VACA encourages, where appropriate, the teaming of contractors and vendors.

Small business goals will also be reportable on an annual basis to ensure goals are being met.  Past Performance will reflect the primes capability to meet goals and provide real opportunities for their small business partners.  Small business prime awards are envisioned as well.

Pursuant to FAR Parts 15 and 16.5, VACA anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to support the SITE requirement. The Government intends to make multiple awards resulting from this solicitation via a two-step down select process to the responsible offerors whose offers, conforming to the solicitation, will be the best value to the Government. 

A pre-proposal conference is scheduled from 1330-1430 on 03 September 2008.  See attachment "INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS" for more information.

Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Rome is looking for capable sources to provide life cycle software development engineering to the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) and the US Intelligence Community worldwide.

Capable sources are sought to focus on enabling the Air Force mission to maintain and improve DoD Intelligence capabilities for the AFRL/RIE Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Rome NY (AFRL Rome).

AFRL Rome has a requirement to provide studies, analyses, designs, development, recommendations, enhancements, integration management, configuration management, testing and evaluation of existing and new systems, and their transition into the operational environment, and system and network administration/operation. In the course of performance, personnel will interface with various agencies at various DODIIS and U.S. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Community sites worldwide through both visits and electronic means. Personnel will also provide technical support to AFRL/RIE in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation of DODIIS Information Technology (IT) and to U.S. C4ISR Community activities. 

The scope of this effort is to provide lifecycle support to DODIIS and the Intelligence missions.  Performance includes studies, analyses, designs, development, recommendations, enhancements, integration management, configuration management, testing and evaluation of existing and new systems, and their transition into the operational environment, software and hardware installation, the generation of technical documentation, and system and network administration/operation to maintain and develop improved capabilities for the U.S. Intelligence Community including the Air Force, Defense Intelligence Agency, Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units, and other members of U.S. Intelligence Community.  Technical activities will include, but not be limited to:  imagery analysis, analytical studies, system feasibility studies, requirements definition/analysis, design, development, implementation, demonstration, systems engineering, integration, installation, site support, configuration management, quality control, familiarization, integration/interoperability/security testing, security engineering, engineering support, system and network administration/operation and testing for the maintenance of existing and the development and transition of new Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) and Intelligence capabilities, and the generation of technical documentation detailing the above activities. Engineering will be provided on existing systems as well as systems still under development. In the course of performance, engineering personnel will interface with various agencies, through visits and electronic means, in the Washington DC area, Hampton VA area, Rome NY area, and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide including Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Cuba and other hazardous locations. Technical expertise will be provided to AFRL to assist in the integration, development and testing of Intelligence systems as required. 

Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level, unless authorized through a current approved National Interest Determination (NID).  All information generated or maintained under this effort is export controlled.   It is solely the responsibility of the contractor to obtain an export license from the U. S. Department of State and to comply with the federal laws and regulations.  Questions concerning the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export licensing must be directed to the U.S. Department of States Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and not the Air Force Project Engineer, Contracting Office, or Air Force Foreign Disclosure Office.  This work will require a source that maintains a SECRET facility clearance and staff with TOP SECRET / SCI security clearances. Approximately 124 (61  Rome NY, 35  Washington DC, 28  Langley AFB VA) personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances will be required for performance.  Based on current estimates, approximately 8-9 personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances will be required for performance at time of award.  An additional 27 cleared personnel (11 in Rome NY and 16 in the Washington DC/Langley VA area) is estimated to be required within the first 45 - 60 days.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an approximate ordering period of 36 months.  We anticipate $49,900,000 to be a sufficient ordering amount for the contemplated 36 month period of performance.

Prior to access being granted, respondents must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, which certifies the respondent is on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL), along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the library, to the SEEAW 5 Program Manager, Christopher Stepanick, at Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, New York 13441-4505, 315-330-3590, or e-mail Christopher.Stepanick@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>Title:  Purchase Order for the Analysis of Petroleum Exports (APEX) database
Description:
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source contract with Lloyd?s Marine Intelligence Unit (LMIU) for the use of the Analysis of Petroleum Exports (APEX) database for the Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The proposed contract will provide oil export and tanker movement information to support the contingency and international oil markets and analyses which are integral to the mission of EIA?s Energy Markets and Contingency Information Division.  The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253[c][1].  The applicable authority is 10 U.S.C.2304 (d) (B), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a] [2] [ii] [B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services that will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements.  No other firm in the world possesses the ability to provide real time global seaborne oil trade a nd tanker movement data.  As such, this unique ability to provide data on real time global seaborne oil exports and tanker movements necessitates the award of a contract to LMIU.  Interested parties may submit rationale as to why they should be considered within fifteen (15) days of this notice via email at Michael.Thomey@hq.doe.gov.  A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541990.  
The period of performance is twelve months plus a 12 month option period.

FDA-08-1045218

Agency/Office: Food and Drug Administration 

Location: Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services 

Title: Mass Spectrometer
 
Description(s): 

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to identify any sources with capabilities of providing a Mass Spectrometer in accordance with the following specifications. 

Specifications:
General Specifications-The instrument must be capable of obtaining full scan mass spectra, as well as tandem mass spectra (known as MS/MS spectra) in the product ion, parent ion and constant neutral loss mode. It must also have the capability to perform true reaction monitoring, in which the instrument can be set up to admit a precursor ion, fragment it, and sequentially monitor selected product ions as the mass spectrometer is stepped from one product ion to the next (see specifications below). The instrument must have multiple sources, including but not limited to an ESI and APCI source.

Programmable drying gas temperature:  The mass spectrometer must utilize temperature programmable drying gas temperature which can be manipulated throughout a chromatographic run.  I am interested in degrade with increased temperature and others need higher drying gas temperatures to be efficiently ionized, a system which incorporates temperature programmable drying gas is essential.

Single tune file:  In order to be the most robust and simple analyzer possible, the instrument must use one tune file for both the optics and analyzer.  Multiple tune files make for complex analysis conditions for the operator.  A single tune file will allow me to be more efficient with my time.

Instrument footprint:  In order to maximize bench space the mass spectrometer must utilize an 180o collision cell and must have dimensions of not more than 15 in/38 cm (h) x 19.5 in/50 cm (w) x 28 inch/71 cm (d).  Bench space is critical in the lab, and any extra space made available will contribute to the productivity of the lab

Ion sources: The mass spectrometer must also come equipped with both an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI) interface as well as an Electrospray Ionization (ESI) interface.  As not all compounds are responsive to ESI, an APCI interface is absolutely necessary for our types of analyses.

Lenseless design:  The mass spectrometer must utilize a lensless design for the analyzer.  The curved collision cell and lensless analyzer design increase sensitivity by reducing chemical noise in the mass spectrometer and increasing ion transmission.  Both of the features increase the overall sensitivity of the instrument.

Flexibility:  To have the most flexible system available, the mass spectrometer must be able to be converted by the lab personnel from an LC/MS/MS to a GC/MS/MS with an optional interface kit.

Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the capability and capacity to provide the identified services with little or no disruption of services to the current users at the FDA. Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above wile in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting"). Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work. Responses to this notice shall be limited to 15 pages, and must include: 

1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.
2. Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses. 

3. Business size for NAICS 611310 with size limitation standards of $6.5M and status, if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages). 

4. DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number (TIN), and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc). Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov to be considered as potential sources. 

5. Identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested. 6. If the company has a Government approved accounting system, please identify the agency that approved the system. Please submit copies of any documentation, such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status (see item #3 above). To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure. Interested offerors should submit their capability statement not exceeding fifteen (15) pages in length, excluding standard brochures. 

SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE no later than 3:00pm, Eastern Time, August 11, 2008. The capabilities response shall be e-mailed to: Karen.petty@fda.hhs.gov. All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the notice will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses. Information provided in response to this notice will be used to assess alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.

This Notice of Intent is being published IAW FAR 5.201(a).  Therefore, no solicitation document is available.  The proposed procurement will assist the USITC in augmenting its dynamic, highly disaggregated computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the United States economy, by adding occupational and state-level detail, by updating its data to include statistics for 1997 and 2002 to its original 1997 database, to support training in the models use, and to validate its results by measuring them against outside data.  The USITC anticipates making an award for 1 base year and 4 option years.  The expected performance date will begin in August 2008.  Written responses to this synopsis must contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  All responses are on a voluntary basis.  No reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information to this announcement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of USITC.  All documents provided to the USITC will become the property of USITC.

<DESC>The USITC seeks to contract a sole source with Xerox for 2 Xerox 3535 color printers and A Xerox Docutech 6180 Production Publisher.  However, the USITC is seeking whether or not there are other sources that can provide these products.  The description of the products is as follows:  The Xerox Docutech 6180model serves as a back-up to the Xerox Nuvera 288 model.  The two publishing machines ability to effectively communicate via a shared front-end has streamlined the printing process within the Commission.  The DocuSP front end provides a common workflow across the two Xerox digital production systems to ensure the highest levels of productivity in all print environments.  Losing this level of efficiency and seamless communication would hinder the agency as a whole.

Along with the important requirement of having a back-up system that uses a Xerox FreeFlow DocuSP Next Generation Controller as the front-end, additional specifications play a role in selecting a printer that not serves as a black/white back-up, but possess the ability to run print jobs in tandem with our Nuvera 288 model.  We require that our proposed black/white back-up have a CPU platform without adding additional software to the network.  We also require that our proposed black/white back-up be able to perform in-line perfect binding, which is essential to the daily work operation performed in our print environment.

The two Xerox 3535 color printer replacements should have the ability to generate Business color at a speed of 70 pages per minute, while having the ability to interact with other Xerox printers on the Network, via the free flow make ready environment that is already implemented within our print shop.  The free flow make ready environment drives the need to have color printers that can also perform page exceptions from a digital front end (DFE).  The agency has made a major investment in the digital printing environment with the acquisition of the Nuvera 288, and we cant afford to lose the seamless connection across printing platforms.  Losing this level of efficiency and seamless communication would hinder the Commission as a whole.  All responses to this announcement must include the functionality and specifications of each machine in detail.  All information provided must be typed in Word format in 10 pages of less.  All responses to this sources sought are on a voluntary basis.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information to this announcement or any follow-up request.  All documents provided to the USITC will become the property of the USITC.  The USITC reserves the right to not make an award to any responders.  All comments or questions should be addressed to Delores Butler, in writing at Delores.Butler @USITC.Gov.

<DESC>We are looking for a company that can supply a free standing bed that allows the flexibility to allow a TDY member that stays with the North Star Inn approximately twenty one to 30 days to sleep in comfort on an eleven inch mattress versus a sofa sleeper that has an four inch mattress. Customer comfort is the number #1 priority within lodging. 

1. The required standards are as follows: The bed cabinet that houses the pivoting bed platform should be 70-7/8 x 20 deep x 85 high. The sofa is mounted at the face of that and is 25-3/8 high x 31-1/2 deep x 70 wide. When the bed is lowered, its projection into the room should not exceed 84-1/4 from the wall surface to the foot of the bed platform. The mattress should be a standard full size innerspring mattress measuring 54 wide x 75 long. The height of the top of the mattress from the floor should not be less than 22-1/2.

2. Panel Material and Finish Specifications.  All wallbed parts will be made of Grade A or B (minimum) Rotary Cut, Whole Piece Face Maple Veneer over particle board (MDF not allowed) finished with UV protective coating to match Nevamar WC5581 Blossom Cherry (in order to match other furniture in the room).  Edgeband is to be 1/8 thick on all edges that are routinely handled or touched by the user and must be radiused to a smooth curved profile.  All other edges to be edgebanded with 1/40 thick edgeband.  All edges must be edgebanded (even those unseen) for moisture content stability. 

3. Sofa Fabric and Style Specification, Sofa Fabric must be Robert Allen Crypton Fabric: Pattern  Sweetgrass, Color  Billiards.  Sofa should have rolled arms, plain (undivided) front skirt design, and 1-1/4 high legs.  Rolled arms to have upholstered, applied decorative panel on front face.  {see also structural sofa specifications below}

4. Testing Requirements, The Sofa Wallbed must have passed the GSA required testing (GSA WallBed Cycle Test #3FNE99-583 and Upholstered Furniture Test #FNAE-80-214A) by certified third party testing laboratory.

5.  Automatic Sofa Function, the seat deck and the back cushions of the sofa at the front of the unit should articulate downward into a storage position automatically as the bed platform is lowered for sleeping. The design should not require any action other than the user pulling forward and downward on one of the handles on the bed platform to accomplish the transformation of the unit from use as a sofa to use as a bed, and visa versa. No secondary releasing or latching is to be required for moving or securing the unit into either the sofa or bed position. After the transformation from sofa to bed, the sofa seat deck and back cushions should end in a safe, out-of-the-way storage position below the bed platform when the bed is down so that they will neither be damaged or cause anyone to trip on them when they are near the bed. Seat cushions should not have to be removed before lowering the bed.

6. Freestanding Requirement, the unit must be completely independent in the engineering of its structure, freestanding, and not require attachment to either the floor or the wall.

7.  The headboard is to pivot from a vertical, stored position to a minimum of a 7 degree angle from vertical (for increased user comfort) when the bed is lowered. This actuation of the headboard must be done without any loss of the 9-1/2 mattress thickness capacity. Headboard is to be a minimum of 18 high and 57 wide.

8.  The shelf will be a permanent shelf with minimum 4 depth and 58 width should be mounted above the headboard for storage of bedside items. This shelf is to be backed by a rail that comes up at least 2-3/8 above the top of the shelf. No part of mattress or other element of the bed storage can intrude on a depth of 5-1/2 space above the headboard (this space includes the shelf rail and the headboard thicknesses) because that would disturb any items placed on the shelf or hung on the wall above the headboard.

9. The automatic legs will have support legs for the bed platform to open automatically as the bed is lowered. These legs are to be activated by a mechanism or linkage that opens them to a 90 degree angle to the bed platform in a way that requires no future maintenance or adjustment to ensure the 90 degree opening position. These legs also serve as handles for lowering the bed platform. When the bed is in the up (stored) position, these handle-legs should be configured such that they cannot pinch the user.

10.  The bed cabinet sides are boxed out into 6-1/4 wide x 20 deep x 85 high piers for durable construction as well as improved aesthetics. Front and back elements of the piers are dadoed in place with added nailing blocks for additional strength.

11.  The sofa seat cushions must be reversible for doubled lifetime durability. Seat and back cushions should be constructed of medium density foam with Dacron batting and have a zipper along one edge. Sofa skirt to be covered with 1/2 thick foam. Sofa arms to be covered with 1 foam at the tops and insides of the arms with 1/2 foam at the front and outside faces of the arms. Top quality upholstery techniques to be used. Sofa seat deck support for cushions to be woven of a minimum of 2 wide ElasBel or equivalent type of webbing. Permalator or other metal grid-type deck supports not to be used.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, (USGS) Central Region, Geographic Information Office has a requirement to acquire LiDAR data for the Houston metropolitan area covering a geographic extent of approximately 229 USGS quarter quadrangles.  The USGS is working closely with various State agencies and local authorities to build and establish partnerships in accordance with the NSDI Partners (National Spacial Data Infrastructure) as defined in OMB Circular A-16 2-7, building and supporting Collaborative NSDI Partnerships.  Through partnerships the USGS will be cost sharing and able to procure the above imagery at significantly reduced cost.  The Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC) is the umbrella agency for the regional Geographic Data Committee (GDC).  GDC currently has in place a contract with Merrick and Company to provide LiDAR data for the Houston metropolitan area.  The USGS considers this specified requirement as a sole source to H-GAC.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish this imagery with significant cost sharing may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer, USGS, PO Box 25046, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO  80225 no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submission will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist;  if no submissions are received by the above appointed time, the Government will proceed with a noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ);  the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation.  No number notes apply. Any questions can be directed to the Contracting Officer, Jean Schilling at (303) 236-9329 or e-mail jschilli@usgs.gov.

<a href="mailto:joseph.butkus@usmc.mil">Maj. Joseph Butkus</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command (MCSC) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of an enterprise solution for Marine Corps first responder and training range command and control communications, also known as the Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) project.  The effort will encompass all Marine Corps Bases, Posts and Stations (BPS) both in the Continental and Outside Continental United States (CONUS and OCONUS).  This is a request for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded based on this RFI.
The E-LMR Command and Control network services will be a tiered system consisting of Base, Regional and Enterprise level operations. At the base level, radio dispatch and subscriber calls, audio recording and repeater/site management/monitor and control activities will be conducted. The regional level will provide cryptographic key management, system level management, and infrastructure restoration services. The enterprise level will control the USMC Global Enterprise Fleetmap (UGEF), coordinate and engineer RF control-channel plans, provide enterprise key generation and distribution to Marine Corps Installations (MCI) regions, manage enterprise databases, manage network configuration and topology, provide enterprise-wide Continuity of Operations (COOP) planning and ensure Information Assurance (IA) compliance (e.g. DIACAP and encryption).  
The system used to satisfy this enterprise requirement must provide coverage both on and off each BPS, range, or USMC related service area and must support narrowband trunked and conventional LMR operations for both clear and encrypted voice as well as mobile data services. The system shall be compliant with the Association of Public-safety Communications Officials International (APCO) P25 suite of standards and all applicable Department of Defense (DoD) information assurance, interoperability, and spectrum utilization requirements. 
There are five regions, 19 identified USMC installations, 112 identified potential repeater sites on USMC or other federal property, and one enterprise node with a COOP requirement.  Site surveys are being conducted by the Marine Corps for potential repeater sites and detailed engineering documents will be provided for those sites.  These site surveys are considered Government Furnished Information but the government does not assert that these are the only sites available to an interested party.  
Interested parties may request a sample site survey that is representative of site survey documentation that may be provided by the Government as part of any subsequent solicitation.  This information will be provided to vendors, subject to International Traffic in Arms Agreement (ITAR) restrictions, in order to determine if the level of detail and type of information provided are adequate for interested firms to submit a response.  The sample site survey is a Microsoft 2003 Access database.  The sample site survey contains data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, USC, SEC 2751 ET. SEQ.) or Executive Order.  Further distribution of data in this database and or located in this disk is not authorized unless specifically approved by the Controlling authority "Marine Corps Systems Command (PG-12)".
Interested sources are requested to submit a capability statement outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement not to exceed 5 pages.  Responses shall also include any comments on the adequacy or quality of data provided in the sample site survey.  Comments on the site survey are not counted as part of the 5 page limit.  Vendors interested in potential subcontracting opportunities are invited to respond.  All interested sources shall identify their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business status.
Interested sources shall send all capability statements via email to joseph.butkus@usmc.mil no later than Aug 18th, 2008.  Requests to receive the sample site survey shall be sent via email to joseph.butkus@usmc.mil and shall include vendors business name, address CAGE or DUNS number and point of contact.  Sample site surveys will be distributed on Compact Disk via FedEx standard overnight.  Vendors are required to provide a FedEx account number for shipping.
THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<a href="mailto:david.freshour@us.army.mil">ACA, ITEC4 - West</a>
<DESC>Under Authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to modify contract W91RUS-08-C-0016 with Mutual Telecom Services Inc.(MTS), exercising FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, for Administrative Telephone Services at Fort Sam Houston Texas. The government will exercise the full 6 month extension allowed under this clause for the period 1 September 2008 through 28 February 2009.  Any responses or inquiries to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government. Responses are due by noon, 19 August 2008 and addressed to Brian Switzer 520-533-1427 or email brian.switzer@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>The Justification and Approval (J&A) is attached below:<BR><BR>1.  Contracting Activity:  Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), Information Technology, E-Commerce and Commercial Contracting Center-West (ITEC4-W), 2133 Cushing Street, Building 61801, Fort Huachuca, Arizona 85613-7070.<BR><BR>2.  Description of Action:  <BR><BR>Extension of performance under FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, for the period 1 September through 28 February 2009 for Administrative Telephone Services (ATS) at Fort Sam Houston, TX, pending the outcome of the re-evaluation of the IMCS II Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The current performance period expires on 31 August 2008.  The total estimate for the six month extension is $4,966,563.19.<BR><BR>3.  Description of Supplies/Services: <BR><BR>The Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this effort is for operations and maintenance of the ATS at Fort Sam Houston, TX.  These services include the operation, administration, and maintenance of Fort Sam Houston, classified and unclassified enterprise network and customer local area networks.  The scope of work on this effort includes: administration; management; parts, supplies, tools and equipment other than GFE; and vehicles to operate and maintain the Administrative Telephone System, Special Projects and cable plant at Fort Sam Houston, TX.  This includes Switchboard Console Operations, Inside Plant, Customer Services (Telephone), and Outside Plant (Cable) required by the Directorate of Information Management (DOIM) to support the organizations at Fort Sam Houston.  The contractor shall provide technical and administrative coordination of inside plant (ISP), outside plant (OSP) and other on-base telephone activities; track and complete all telecommunications service orders.  The contractor shall also be responsible for operations and maintenance (O&M) of the Intuity Audix Voice Mail System, Call Accounting System, and data input of Local Service Requests (LSR), cable record changes, associated components and instruments into the Telephone Management System (TMS).  The contractor may also be required to provide material, overtime, travel and per diem, and training in support of requirements, as needed.<BR><BR>Special projects are a critical part of the operations and maintenance requirement for the Ft Sam Houston DOIM.  Special projects are separate CLINS for work identified as necessary to meet new and changing situations but could not possibly be known at time of contract award.  Special projects are based on events, circumstances or changing situations that occur over the course of the contract that require special consideration and provide the customer the flexibility to identify, evaluate, monitor, and fund these projects using the existing contract.  This work may be subject to the Service Contract Act (SCA) or the Davis Bacon Act (DBA), or a combination of both, and is vital to the mission of the DOIM.  Having one contractor perform both new installation and operations and maintenance of existing work, ensures continuity of services and saves time and resources.  Ft Sam Houston has experienced an increase in mission support and personnel due to BRAC initiatives and this means that the DOIM must continually add data, phone, and network conduits and connectivity to new and existing buildings to support the increased tempo.  When tasked, the contractor shall provide a detailed proposal in accordance with the PWS associated with the Special Project.  Special projects will be funded by modification to the contract.<BR><BR>In addition to the requirements cited above, Ft Sam Houston has an immediate need for three new services not included in the current contract.  These services are a result of new and evolving technologies, unforeseen at original contract award, but now deemed essential and critical to the operation and maintenance of the Ft Sam Houston Directorate of Information Management.  The new services are Land Mobile Radio (LRM) Network operators, Telecommunications Management Systems (TMS) support and Consult and Appointment Management Office (CAMO) support.  The contractor shall provide technically qualified personnel for the operations and maintenance of the LMR network to include Government owned or commercially owned communications towers as well as E-911 service administration.  The LMR network is a new Force Protection measure that all CONUS DOIMS must incorporate.  The contractor shall also be responsible for the installation and integrity of the NET PLUS 6 TMS database as well as supporting the telephone switch at the CAMO satellite office.  The addition of these new services will result in a net increase of 3.5 personnel.<BR><BR>The increased tempo, coupled with an outdated Performance Work Statement, has identified a need for an additional Telecommunications Switch operator as well as additional inside and outside plant technicians to keep pace with the requirement.  The original PWS identified one host switch and four (4) switch nodes and 15,320 active communication lines.  Since 2001, a new switch has been installed to support the Base Realignment and Closure Joint-Medical Training Centers and approximately 7,400 new communication lines have been added with an additional 12,300 lines projected in FY09.<BR><BR>Finally, the Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) has an urgent need to complete renovation projects in the hospital delayed under the previous bridge contract due to the structure of the contract.  This delay has caused a ripple affect in prioritizing critical projects needed to support returning injured war fighters and existing patients.  The BRAC office at Ft Sam Houston has offered to fully fund two (2) additional Telecommunications Mechanic II positions to alleviate the backlog.<BR><BR>4.  Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) Only One Responsible Source.<BR><BR>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:<BR><BR>These services are currently being provided under contract W91RUS-08-C-0016, with Mutual Telecom Services Inc. (MTS).  Prior to this bridge contract, services were being performed by MTS under contract DABL03-02-C-0001. The current performance period expires on 31 August 2008.  These services are being competed as part of a larger consolidated, competitive, small business set aside, the Information Management Communications Support II (IMCS- II) effort.  This requirement is necessary to allow for the Contracting Officers actions in response to the Government Accounting Office (GAO) protests and subsequent re-evaluation of offers submitted for the IMCS II IDIQ contract.  A decision is anticipated for the January 2009 timeframe with full performance expected to begin March 2009.  It is anticipated that award of a task order for Fort Sam Houston can be made within two months.  <BR><BR>It is not in the Governments best interest to compete this short six month requirement for interim support.  A new contractor would be required to ramp-up, to include hiring employees and purchasing vehicles, tools and test equipment.  The Government estimates these ramp-up costs at a minimum of approximately $175,000 (based on historical data).  In addition, competition for this six month bridge could potentially result in at least two different contractors providing services over the course of a few months, creating personnel turbulence, significant learning curves, and potential loss of critical employees.  Finally, it appears unlikely that any contractor can mobilize at this point in time to even attempt the effort.<BR><BR>A delay or break in services would result in a critical loss of support to Fort Sam Houston.  Fort Sam Houston DOIM serves many important customers such as Army Medical Department (AMEDD), Joint Medical Training Centers (METC), Southern Regional Contracting Center West (SRCCW), United States Army South (USARSO), United States Army North (ARNORTH), Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), and Homeland Defense & Civil Support Operations. <BR><BR>Award to another source at this point would cost the government time (a potentially extensive learning curve and familiarity with the site); significant duplication of cost that would not be recouped through competition; and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirement.  <BR><BR>Moreover, a new protest was received 21 July 2008 regarding the IMCS II Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, further delaying award and impacting this requirement.<BR><BR>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  <BR><BR>These services have been competed as part of IMCS II and significant competition has been obtained.  A notice of intent for the IMSC II IDIQ contract, which included the Ft Sam Houston ATS effort, was synopsized on FedBizOps.  For this short term effort, the only responsible source who can provide these services without substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable risk of mission failure is MTS, the incumbent contractor.  <BR><BR>7.  Actions to Increase Competition: <BR><BR>A special notice and intent to exercise FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, for Contract W91RUS-08-C-0012, with award to Mutual Telecom Services Inc. (MTS) as the only responsible source, will be posted 4 or 5 August 2008 in FedBizOpps.  It is anticipated that no further actions will be necessarry after award of the IMSC II IDIQ contract, as orders will be issued in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1) to satisfy this effort.<BR><BR>8.  Market Research:<BR><BR>Research has been done for this action as part of the IMCS II contract.  ITEC4-W received 23 proposals in response to the IMCS II solicitation which clearly demonstrates there are many companies that can perform these services.  However, none of these sources are able to commence performance by 1 September 2008.<BR><BR>9.  Interested Sources:  <BR><BR>MTS is currently performing this contract and is the only known source capable of performing at the current levels while maintaining continuity of services through 31 August 2008.  The notice required by FAR 5.201 will be published 4 or 5 August 2008, and any proposals or inquiries received shall be considered.  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in performing the six month interim contracts that will transition to the IMSC II IDIQ contract.  The original synopsis for this bridge contract was published 11 February 2008 and no responses were received.<BR>

The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L). You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov. Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0869 Tape, Package Sealing 3.1mil Prepack w/pistol grip<br />7510-00-NIB-0870 Tape, Package Sealing 3.1mil Prepack w/handheld<br />7510-00-NIB-0871 Tape, Package Sealing 3.1mil Prepack<br />7510-00-NIB-0872 Tape, Package Sealing 1.9mil Prepack</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Tape, Package Sealing to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0869<br />MMM-3750-CS<br />UNV-91004<br /><br />7510-00-NIB-0870<br />MMM-BP-6<br />MMM-3750RDCR<br />UNV-31102</p>

<p>7510-00-NIB-0872<br />MMM37102CRPK<br />SPR-01530<br />SPR-60043<br />UNV-63000</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Tape, Package Sealing to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than August 22, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>

The US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service in Pullman, WA has a requirement for DNA sequencing.  Which includes high through-put sequencing, DNA cloning and protein expression systems.  Amplicon Express has been selected on a sole source basis because they have demonstrated the ability efficiently make BAC (Bacterial Artificially Chromosome) libraries.  This  was the method by which the USDA obtained complete sequence of the Anaplasm marginale genome.  Amplicon is located near our Pullman facility making it possible to process samples from animals without freezing the samples for transport which is required.  Our staff is able to work face-to-face with the staff of Amplicon Express which minimizes the need for repeat sequencing.  Amplicon Express has provided same day service and the USDA needs to retain data consistency.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number RFQ-036-4384-08 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-24.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334519.   For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business size standard is 500 employees. USDA ARS has a requirement for a textile particle measuring instrument.  Critical characteristics of this equipment are as follows.  This system must be capable of measuring individual long slender particles in an air stream using cameras, pulsed lasers, illumination optics and detectors for non-destructive testing.  This instrument must make multiple high resolution measurements on these particles to determine mean diameter, length, diameter histograms, length histograms, opaqueness, and measurement statistics.  This instrument must have the ability to measure fiber diameter and fiber length respectively with the potential to independently perform these measurements simultaneously with the addition of a second camera.  In this configuration, the second camera would be operated from the same PC. Images could then be acquired simultaneously and analyzed together.  The fiber diameter measuring system must produce high magnification shadowgraph images of the fibers as they pass by the measurement volume.  High contrast images would allow measurement of the fiber thickness down to 3.5 microns. The lower limit for diameterer measurements would be 3.5 microns ranging to 25 microns.  In order to obtain length measurements a second set of lens would be placed on the camera, the upper limit for the fiber length would be approximately 2.5 inches.  For diameter and length, the components in the system must be configured onto a rail for a high magnification system.  The rail would be 750 mm long with a laser head and diffuser at one end and camera at the opposite end.  The laser head would connect to a power supply.  For the high magnification the camera is smaller than the lens attached to it.  For low magnification a regular photographic lens would be utilized.  Camera and laser must be connected for timing and data to the host PC.  This instrument must include software for synchronization and control of systems components, data acquisition, processing and analysis. Quoted price should include installation and on site training. Two copies of descriptive literature showing that the offered equipment meets all specifications must accompany the quotation.  Delivery time is 30 days ARO.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

Contracting Office Address:  
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management 
1900 E Street, N.W. Rm. 1342
Washington, D.C. 20415

REQUIREMENT:  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) and incorporates Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions and clauses as amended in Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26 dated June 12, 2008.

The applicable North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code is 236220, with a small business size standard of $6.00 Million.

OVERVIEW OF DUTIES/REQUIREMENTS

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) located at 1900 E Street, NW, Washington D.C., is soliciting quotations as a small business set-aside for painting of a brick enclosure within the cooling tower complex located on the penthouse of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (TRB).

1. SCOPE: 

This project must be executed in phases per the requirement that four (4 )out of the six (6) cooling towers must be in operation at all times. The existing paint is rapidly chipping from the brick walls and will require pre-coat preparation prior to painting. The painting area is 41 feet wide, 26 feet high, and 140 feet in length with a 12 x 140 concrete ceiling. 

2. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

&#61607; Protection of OPMs equipment is paramount. Protective sheets/cloth must be used to protect surrounding equipment from paint debris. Please be aware that four out of six cooling towers will be operational at any given time. It is imperative that all preventive measures are exercised to prevent debris from entering the cooling towers.
&#61607; Removal of existing paint from brick walls and disposal of properly with-out risk to government building equipment and personal. Prior to paint removal, an OPM representative will perform a walk-though to ensure that proper protection is in place before cleaning begins.
&#61607; Power wash all louvers running along the main wall (41 x 140). The contractor will be responsible for maneuvering the power washer so that there is no damage to lights, switches, outlets, galvanized pipe, or any other items/equipment that could be damaged by high pressure water.
&#61607; Preparation and coating of brick walls with at least two coats of high quality water based, lead-free paint (color to be determined) that has the following characteristics/specifications: Breathable to allow moisture to escape from the brick to the air; good resistance to wind driven moisture; capability to protect the brick from carbonation and chloride penetration; capability to withstand movement resulting from freeze/thaw cycles; sufficient viscosity to build up the required thickness, close pores, and not run; bridge dynamically moving cracks should any exist. In addition, painting of the 4 protective ladders along the main wall will require a rust resistant primer in addition to being paint to match the corresponding wall.
&#61607; Consultation with an OPM representative on any instructions and/or recommendations to ensure longevity of any newly painted brick enclosure.
&#61607; The enclosure has a number of obstacles that the contractor will need to take into account when performing this project: 10 x 4 elevated platform, ductwork, damper grills, conduits, and light fixtures. In addition, it is highly recommended that the contractor not use spraying equipment, but rather rollers and brushes, to eliminate the possibility of airborne paint debris from entering the water tower system or over spray onto any exposed equipment.
&#61607; Implementation of necessary safety measures to provide a safe work environment for contractor staff and OPM employees. 
&#61607; Scheduling of work shall be done through John Mendenhall prior to commencement of work.

3.  DELIVERABLES

52.212-2  EvaluationCommercial Items (JAN 1999)
 (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

1.  Corporate Capabilities and Past Performance

This refers to the offerors corporate resources, capabilities and performance results (outcomes) of similar contract (and project) efforts.  Relevant contracts and projects referenced must have been completed within the past five (5) years or currently in progress for services and support similar to the requirements of the statement of work.

The offerors corporate capabilities will be evaluated based on the offerors description and discussion of its corporation (and any proposed subcontractors) demonstrating corporate resources and capabilities to perform the tasks contained in the statement of work.

The offerors corporate past performance will be evaluated on the relevance of performance documented in submitted project summaries relating to type of work, complexity, and technical applicability of experience.

The Government will conduct reference checks in order to determine the offeror's corporate past performance.  In this regard, for each key personnel proposed and for each contracted project listed, the offeror shall provide a point of contact (name and telephone number) to support past performance.

2.  Technical and Management Approach

The offeror will be evaluated on how it proposes to plan, manage, control, and provide the support and services required in the statement of work.  The offeror should discuss its approach to meeting the requirements of the statement of work in sufficient detail to demonstrate its understanding of the requirements and to allow OPM to evaluate its approach.

3.  Experience and Expertise of Staff

The offeror's staff will be evaluated based on descriptions of key roles and submitted resumes illustrating an appropriate skill mix and experience of key staff and other proposed technical, management, and project support staff.

4.  Price

All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.    The degree of the importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of quotations with regard to other factors on which selection will be based.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(ix)  The provision at 52.212-1, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will offer the best value to the Government, technical factors, price, and past performance considered.  To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the technical evaluation factors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in descending order of importance.  1) Technical Understanding and Approach.  The proposed technology will be evaluated on its ability to meet all of the requirements listed in part (vi) of this solicitation.  Contractors shall furnish as part of their quotation all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether their service meets the technical requirements.  The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, Minimally Acceptable, Acceptable, or Exceptional.  A score of Minimally Acceptable would mean that the proposed technology minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement.   A score of Acceptable would mean that the proposed technology fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented.  A score of Exceptional would mean that the proposed technology exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement.  2) Price.  The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus four options.  FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) applies to this procurement.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The vendor may submit a rent versus purchase price quote if renting the software is a standard commercial practice offered by the vendor.  Price is of less importance than technical capabilities and past performance combined.  Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer. 3) Past Performance: Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.  The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors past performance record.  Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance.  Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors record of past performance.  4) English Language and U.S. Currency: FAR provisions 52.214-34 -- Submission of Offers in the English Language (Apr 1991) and 52.214-35 -- Submission of Offers in U.S. Currency (Apr 1991) applies to this acquisition. Offers received in other than in the English language or U.S. dollars shall be rejected.  The Government intends to issue one firm fixed award for this requirement.  The Government reserves the right to make award without discussions. (x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JUN 2003).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendors online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6  STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Cryostat for Measurement of SET Devices to be used in Atomic Physics Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. ***

BACKGROUND
NIST has an ongoing program to investigate single-electron tunneling (SET) nano-electronic devices, for applications in metrology and quantum information.  Amongst the requirements for high-quality measurements of these following devices are the following:

1) Low temperatures.
2) Low noise environment, both electrical and acoustic.

At present, this program has a dilution refrigerator which can achieve temperatures as low as 0.02 K; this system has been shown over the course of years to allow high-quality measurements, with very low electrical noise.  This capability has been achieved by addition of several different types of custom-made filters, which were added to the cryogenic system after its delivery by the commercial vendor.

This dilution refrigerator can achieve very low temperatures, but it is not well-suited to measurements above 0.5 K, nor is it well-suited to varying the temperature.  In addition, it is a slow system: the turnaround time from base temperature to changing samples to return to base temperature is 2 1/2 days.  In order to expand NISTs measurement capability, a temperature scanning measurement system is required.  This will allow measurement over a wide range of temperatures and will allow characterization of a large number of samples by virtue of a much faster turnaround time.

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s): 

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Each, Cryostat for Measurement of SET Devices

Contractor shall meet or exceed the following minimum required technical specifications:  

Ability to scan temperatures from 5 K to 300 K

The need for filtering and thermalization imposes a requirement that, at every stage including the vacuum flange, there be a large diameter area available for custom-made filters.  This area shall be at least 50 square cm.

Turnaround time: six hours or less.

Low acoustic vibrations transmitted to the sample: the vendor shall specify in the quotation the spectrum of vibrations at the sample space from 0 Hz up to 10 kHz.

Magnetic field: Magnetic field of at least 2 Tesla.

Manual controls: To the extent that this system is designed to be operated in conjunction with a computer, there shall be a parallel set of manual controls that allow full operation of the system without any computer whatsoever.

Unattended time: It shall be possible for the system to run for 30 hours without operator intervention.

A full set of mechanical drawings and manuals shall be included.

To the extent that any metric fittings are used in the assembly, the Contractor shall supply a set of spare metric bolts, nuts, and washers.
The spare bolts shall be identical in size and shape to those used in the system.  The Contractor shall supply at least 50 of each of the spare bolts, nuts, and washers.


***The Contractor shall state the warranty period and the coverage provided.

***Delivery shall be FOB Destination and completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. ***

*** Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

1. Visual and Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2. Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications. The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor. At a minimum, NIST will test to ensure the maximum specified speed and accuracy requirements are met and the required manipulator and rail motions are reached while carrying the rated maximum load and at the manipulator's greatest rated extension.

****The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, 3) Previous Experience, and 4) Price. Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Previous Experience, when combined, are more important than Price. 

****Under the Technical Capability factor, Greater consideration will be given to Contractors whose quote offers the following:

The ability to scan temperatures from 2 K to 300 K, and to control temperature with an instability and imprecision of at most 0.1 K.

The large diameter area for custom-made filters should be as large a possible; 75 to 100 square cm would be desirable.  This area does not have to be one contiguous area, but can be comprised of several individual areas.  As part of this requirement, a proposal to include hermetic SMA jack-to-jack coaxial feedthroughs at the vacuum flange would be desirable.

Turnaround time: smaller is better, with two hours being desirable.

Low noise: as low an audible noise level from pumps as possible.

Low size and weight; for example, 25 kg and 1.5 m high by 1 m wide.

Magnetic field: Magnetic field of at least 5 Tesla.

Unattended time: the system shall be capable to run for three days without operator intervention.

****Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quotations shall include the make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature, which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product(s) meet or exceed the specifications stated above. 

****Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service, provided by the Contractor. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/ or information provided by NIST or its affiliates. Quoters shall provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar products have been sold. The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name and address of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; and the date of delivery. 

***Past Experience shall be evaluated to determine the extent of the Contractor's experience of at least five (5) years in and knowledge in providing similar instrumentation. System shall have previously demonstrated long term ruggedness, durability and consistency. Evaluation of past experience may be based on contacts used for past performance; however, the vendor should provide additional references relating to its past experience information, if necessary. To allow assessment, each quote must include appropriate documentation. 

***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING FAR PART 13 SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES. 
***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334112.
This requirement is being competed on a total small business set-aside basis.
Description
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for the purchase of  the following:

1 system consisting of:

Video Data Collection Storage and Back-up System 55

    2 -  JetStor NAS 1000 with dual SCSI 1U single power  

    2 -  JetStor SATA 416S RAIDs with 16 500GB drives with 1Gb cache  

 Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and Test Retrieval Conference Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVid) projects (supporting Information Technology Laboratory (ITLs) Information Discovery Usage and Sharing Program (IDUS) Program).  These projects have many large text and video collections which are used for research and in conjunction with the evaluations run by the group. The loss of this data, some of which may not be available from other sources, would have major harmful affects on group operations. Currently this data is being backed up using the NIST Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) system. Restoring a one-terabyte file system containing millions of files from TSM took several weeks and careful supervision by administrators as well as the TSM administrator in order to avoid crashing the TSM server.  TSM, as deployed at NIST Division 894 was not well-suited to restoring this kind of data.

By adding the requested NAS engines and RAIDS to our existing storage architecture with some reconfiguration we will be able to mirror our data to local storage. This will protect against the loss of valuable data. It will also allow for fast recovery in case of hardware failure up to and including automatic fail-over to the backup mirrors.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not apply to this procurement.

<DESC>The NIST Public and Business Affairs Office has a need to acquire conference support services to help run NIST conferences in accordance with this Statement of Work (SOW).

1.	Background

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recognizes the value of scientific conferences that are relevant to its mission and to the public interests.  Conferences permit individuals and organizations to engage in a variety of activities that are critical to the development and implementation of NIST programs and play an important role in fulfilling NISTs mission, in particular its technology transfer function.

These conferences are an effective way to bring together various groups of people to share information, educate the scientific community, the public, work with state and local government partners, and/or learn from non-governmental stakeholders.  
Conference planning at NIST has been centralized in the Conference Program, part of  the NIST Public & Business Affairs Office,  over the past twenty years.  The majority of meetings are held at the NIST site; however, some meetings are held offsite. In FY05, 58 meetings took place with an attendance of 5,853 and total expenses of $1,271,447.58.  All but nine meetings were held at NIST.  In FY06, there were 69 meetings held with an attendance of 7,854 and total expenses of $2,520,960.99.  Eleven meetings were held offsite.  And, in FY07, there were 49 meetings held with an attendance of 5,653 and total expenses of $1,822,883.98.  Eleven meetings were held offsite. (See attached spreadsheet for more detailed data.)
NIST conferences are funded in a variety of ways. Funding for a particular conference may come from co-sponsors, NIST appropriated funds, fees collected from attendees, fees collected from exhibitors, or a combination thereof.  Over the past three years, 75% of the conferences were funded by attendee registration fees, 20% of the conferences had registration fees reduced by some expenses being covered by co-sponsors and 5% of the conferences had registration fees reduced by some expenses being covered by NIST appropriated funds. 
2.    Scope of Work
For most of the conferences, the NIST Conference Program staff will handle the logistics and interface with the attendees for all conferences.  The staff will coordinate support services, such as audiovisuals, room setups, food functions and transportation.  NIST staff will also prepare and distribute badges, participant lists, handouts, and staff the registration desks.  However, for the few large conferences that will be held offsite, the Contractor may be asked to help with some of these tasks.
For each task order, NIST will provide a description of the requirements for the conference, NISTs projected costs, the expected number of attendees, and the sources of funding. 
The Contractor shall also manage the registration process for all conferences. For each task order for which all or part of the funding will be from collected fees, the contractor will be required to assess, electronically collect, and account for registration fees from conference attendees and exhibitors, and submit conference revenue to NIST, as appropriate. 
The fees the contractor collects should be designed to cover NISTs expenses associated with the conference, the contractors expenses associated with the conference, and the contractors profit. NIST appropriated funds may not be applied toward the purchase of food. Accordingly, food-related expenses must be factored into the fees charged to conference attendees.
The Contractor shall develop and/or provide an on-line registration system for all conferences.  The system must be capable of downloading information, including the electronic accounting information, on a monthly and/or weekly basis for submission to NIST.  
In addition, for all conferences, the Contractor shall provide up-to-date attendance figures for attendees and exhibitors and other groups as specified in the task order to the COTR on a weekly basis and provide a list in alphabetical order by company name, mail address, point of contact, telephone number, business size, and description of business.
In addition to the services described above, a task order may require the contractor to perform the following types of work: 
a.	Website.  Create and maintain websites for conferences with content and links that comply with NISTs information technology security requirements and other                                             
           Government standards, including 508 compliance.
b.	Publicity.  Place advertisements for marketing purposes. 
c.	Pre-Conference Mailing/Promotion. Mailing, faxing or e-mailing conference materials; developing promotional materials including flyers, brochures and registration forms.  
d.	Database management.  Develop and/or provide an on-line registration system for the conference capable of downloading information, including the electronic accounting information, on a monthly and/or weekly basis for submission to NIST.
e.	Conference Registration and Event Fees.  Manage the registration process, electronically collect, account for, and submit fees to NIST.
f.	Attendance Records.  Provide up-to-date attendance figures for attendees and exhibitors and other groups as specified in the task order to the COTR on a weekly basis. Provide a list in alphabetical order by company name-mail address, point(s) of contact, telephone number, business size (i.e., large, small, women owned, etc.) and description of business.
g.	Identification Badges.  Design and develop badges for all attendees and participants.  Develop and/or implement a system, which shall ensure that duplicate badges are not developed for any conference participants.  
h.	Conference Administrative Responsibilities.  Provide sufficient number of personnel to ensure that registered attendees will be processed within ten (10) minutes of their arrival to the conference.
i.	Facilities.  Provide meeting room(s) and a registration area for the conference.    
j.	Food Service.  Provide coffee service, lunch, receptions and dinners for conference attendees.
k.	Sleeping Rooms.  Coordinate sleeping rooms at the request of conference attendees.
l.	Audiovisual Equipment.  Obtain audiovisual equipment for conferences held off the NIST campus.  For conferences held on the NIST campus, the Government will provide the audiovisual equipment.       
m.	Special Needs (Physical).  Coordinate assistance, as necessary, for individuals with special needs.  Such assistance may include a sign language interpreter and wheel chair access.
n.	Conference Setup and Cleanup.  Set up and break down all attendees displays.  Clear the conference areas of all materials and dispose of them properly.  Coordinate the return of materials, as agreed to with NIST.  Signage shall be removed and packed carefully to allow for future use at conferences.
o.	Security.  Provide security for off-site conferences.
p.	Physical Security.  Provide physical security for property left in place by vendors before, during or after a conference for both on-site and off-site conferences.  
q.	Reports.  The Contractor shall submit to the COTR a written, running log reflecting registered attendees.  Verbal reports shall be provided to the COTR upon request.  No duplicate entries shall be shown in the report.  A final accounting of all conference participants, including those who register on-site, shall be provided to the COTR within two (2) weeks after completion of the conference. The report should include information on all paid, new, and to-be-billed attendees.  When the purchasing process for a conference is complete and invoices are paid, the Contractor shall provide a final financial report to NIST.


3. Evaluation Factors with Sample Task 
The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation on a best value basis.  The following factors will be used for the evaluation1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Experience and 4) Revenue Distribution. The relative importance of the evaluation factors is as follows:  past performance is more important then technical approach which is more important then experience, which is more important than revenue distribution.  
 (1) Past Performance  NIST will evaluate past performance of contracts of a similar nature and scope.  The Contractor shall provide a list of contacts, including phone numbers, to allow NIST to evaluate a firm's past performance in successfully accomplishing three related/similar contracts within the last three years; 
(2) Technical Approach - Provide sufficient information to demonstrate ability to meet the Government's requirement and to address proposed management of the conference/programs and plans to provide seamless support, which should include identification and qualifications of relevant personnel.  Contractors should describe the manner in which they will set fees in their proposals.
(3)  Experience  The offerors experience will be evaluated to determine that nature and extent of successful completion of similar conference work. NIST will consider the extent to which any awards or certifications, letters of appreciation, commendations, or industry recognitions of excellence indicate that the offeror has successfully completed similar contracts
(4) Revenue Distribution  The Contractor shall provide a price structure process to be applied for this contract which will allow NIST to evaluate the costs the contractor will impose on third parties, i.e., attendees, exhibitors. The Contractor shall describe how they will distribute conference revenue to reimburse NISTs expenses associated with the conference, its own expenses and its profit in accordance with the SOW.  The quote shall indicate the priority in which the revenue distributions will be made.  The revenue distribution schemes will be evaluated to determine which is the most advantageous to the Government

<SUBJECT>Science in the Monument Kiosk
<SOLNBR>WRAD-8-43460
<RESPDATE>081908
<CONTACT>Melvin N. Fondue, Phone (206) 526-6043, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for Science in the Monument Kiosk. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a United States Federal agency dedicated to understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and to conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet Unites States economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA is the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.</p>
<p>
<p>The Office of National Marine Sanctuary Program (ONMS), established in 1972 by the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and administered by NOAA, protects a network of 13 special marine and freshwater areas. The goal of the NMSA is to set aside and manage areas for resource protection, research, enhanced public education, and compatible public and private uses. Management activities for each sanctuary are detailed in site-specific management plans which outline regulatory goals, describe boundaries, and identify staffing and budget needs, set priorities and performance measures for resource protection, research, and education programs.</p>
<p>In 2001, NOAA initiated a process to consider designating the waters surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) as a National Marine Sanctuary. On June 15, 2006, George Bush established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (Monument) by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States' jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain. The 1200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also the most remote archipelago in the world.</p>
<p>At a time when ocean resources around the world are in major decline, the designation of the Monument enabled nearly 140,000 square miles of the region to receive the highest form of marine environmental protection in the United States, creating the largest protected marine area in the world.</p>
<p><br />Project Description<br />Mokupapapa Center's primary goal is to educate the public on the natural and cultural resources within the Monument, and the importance of protecting this fragile ecosystem. In operation for five years, this facility has proven invaluable in bridging the distant monument to the island of Hawaii by reaching approximately 60,000 people each year. Outreach efforts focus on a variety of topics within the Monument, including ecosystem dynamics, human impacts, cultural importance, and geology. One area of value that is not yet highlighted as thoroughly as it could is the current research taking place each summer on research vessels, in laboratories throughout the state, and other new developments in our attempts to better understand Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument.</p>
<p>This newly proposed kiosk exhibit for Mokupapapa Discovery Center will bring together the current research taking place in the NWHI. It will be an interactive display that will allow visitors to view a variety of topics such as survey data, albatross foraging patterns, and the latest research findings. Information on current research cruises will also be accessible, helping visitors to learn about the goals of each cruise whether that be biological, ecosystem mapping, archeological on both land and in the water, and read updates written on the ship. They will be able to learn more about the work being done through the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB), such as their apex predator studies and coral research, to better understand the relationship between the Main Hawaiian islands and the Monument. They will also be able to learn more about the National Marine Sanctuaries throughout the United States, and efforts connecting multiple sites such as albatross tracking and ocean currents. There will be a great deal of information available through the kiosk, and so easy navigation through the information will be vital. <br />Scope of Work<br />Designing, programming, producing and installing a freestanding interactive video kiosk that can be easily updated and will connect to at least two external websites. Information to be included:<br />&#61623; Internet access to current research cruise updates &amp; Papahanaumokuakea.gov, including biological, geological and cultural cruises<br />&#61623; Internet access to Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Research pages<br />&#61623; Oikonos albatross tracking maps &amp; visuals<br />&#61623; Office of National Marine Sanctuaries overview video<br />&#61623; NOAA sea level change maps &amp; visuals<br />&#61623; Pacific Ocean currents maps &amp; visuals<br />&#61623; Video clips &amp; photos from past NWHI research <br />&#61623; Other pages to be defined</p>

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web<br />site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation) and computes a proposed rate).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Procurement and Grants Office (PGO) intends to award one to four purchase orders for the lease, with an option to buy, of an infrared thermal detection system. These infrared thermal detection systems will be used in an evaluation to determine their reliability in measuring body temperatures as well as their precision and accuracy in comparison to the traditional oral method of measurement in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>This requirement is available for full and open competition. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>

<p>The selection of offerors for contract award will be based on the evaluation of proposals. The contract(s) will be awarded to the offeror(s) whose proposal is considered to be the most advantageous to the Government, technical and cost/price considered. Offerors are advised that in the evaluation process, technical is more important than cost/price. The trade off process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed. This process permits tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced or highest technically rated offeror. Further, the system specifications established in the Statement of Work are the minimum required and proposals will be evaluated based on meeting and/or exceeding these minimum requirements. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards under this solicitation to the offeror(s) whose proposal(s) provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>

Section B: Price/Costs

Please list price/cost according to Section L.9

Section C: Background and Work Statement 

Concerned about the implications of climate change for weather-related losses incurred by federal agencies, Congress directed the GAO to conduct a study to describe what is known about how climate change might affect insured and uninsured losses incurred by federal agencies.  The result of that GAO study directed the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to obtain an analysis of the potential long-term implications of climate change.  

Description of Work
C.1	Objective

The objective of this contract is to obtain an analysis of the potential long-term implications of climate change for the crop insurance program -in regard to FCIC and to approved insurance providers (AIP's) and the development of a program impact model that incorporates the impacts of the implications identified to the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA).    This analysis shall use the assessments from the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to establish sound estimates of expected future conditions.  Key components of this analysis shall include: (1) the scenarios under anticipated climatic conditions of Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.3 "The effects of global change on agriculture, biodiversity, land, and water resources"  (See C.6) and Risk Management Agency's expected exposure levels based on the current FCIC book of business along with a baseline (no impact due to climate change) scenario that leads to an estimate of potential future losses for these scenarios; (2) the potential budgetary implications and consequences of these scenarios' potential future loss estimates for FCIC and AIP's expressed in the program impact model; and (3) potential mitigation options that the FCIC might use to reduce exposure to loss.  The development of a program impact model is required to express potential climate changes as changes in mean or variance of crop yields or shifts in production areas.  The program impact model shall have the capability to analyze the budgetary impacts climate change (or baseline) scenarios have on FCIC and on AIP's under current terms, or potential alternative terms, of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA).  There shall be training provided to key RMA personnel on the use of the program impact model.

C.2	Scope

The work will require skills and experience in climatology, agricultural meteorology, crop insurance underwriting, agricultural risk management, data analysis, actuarial science, statistical modeling, project planning, scheduling, quality control, categorizing, analyzing, research, critical thinking, innovative problem solving techniques, oral presentations, report writing, and the use of Microsoft product applications.  Travel will also be required.

Many studies have indicated that global temperatures are increasing and are projected to continue increasing.  Warming is expected to change rainfall patterns.  Increased drought is possible in many regions of the U.S. while rainfall could increase in other areas.  The frequency and severity of extreme events are also expected to increase.  These factors could have a major impact on U.S. agriculture and consequently, FCIC and AIPs.  
C.3	Specific Tasks and Work Requirements

The contractor shall deliver to the government a program impact model and a report that analyze the potential long term implication of climate change for the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

C.3.1 	Program Impact Model Concept & Direction Report

The Program Impact Model Concept and Direction Report is to outline the process that the contractor will follow in developing the program impact model that will incorporate the impact of the implications to be identified into the Standard Reinsurance Agreement.   After submission of the Program Impact Model Concept and Direction Report the contractor will participate with RMA in a teleconference that outlines and discusses what the anticipated inputs and results of the model will be.

C.3.2	Report and Program Impact Model: Climate Change Impacts on Crop Insurance

The report shall include expected changes in the frequency and severity of weather by region and the corresponding impacts on the expected distribution of crop yields and shifts in production areas. The report shall also include the results of a program impact model of the financial impacts of the expected yield distributions (and corresponding price changes) on both FCIC and AIPs.  In evaluating the financial impacts on FCIC and AIPs, the program impact model shall consider current, or potential, risk-sharing terms of the SRA.  The report and program impact model shall also consider whether catastrophic modeling is needed to maintain actuarially sound programs and also consider loss mitigation options such as limiting coverage.  The program impact model shall include a stress testing component.  The report and the program impact model shall analyze at the state/crop/plan of insurance level of aggregation for the major crops in the FCIC book of business.

C.3.3	Summary Report of Climate Change Program Impact Model Stress Tests

The report shall provide a summary of the various scenarios that the contract has arrived at with regards to the Climate Change Program Impact Model and the impact from the various stress tests that the contractor has accomplished. 

C.3.4 	Final Report

After approval of the work outlined in C.3.1, C.3.2, C.3.3  Draft Climate Change Report, the Program Impact Model Development, the Summary Report of Climate Change, Stress Tests and oral presentation, the contractor shall deliver to the Government a Final Report that summarizes and takes into account any concerns or changes that may be requested by RMA.    

C.3.5	Training on the Program Impact Model 

Model documentation and training on the program impact model shall be provided to key RMA personnel.    
C.4	Delivery Schedule

The offeror shall determine and submit a Delivery Schedule to RMA that takes into consideration the 30 day Government review period so that the schedule accommodates the review period while minimizing disruption to the remaining delivery due dates.

Early submission of a deliverable and/or early RMA acceptance of a deliverable is permitted without affecting the due dates for the subsequent deliverables.

In the case of a rejection, specifics will be provided to the Contractor as to the reasons for the rejection, as well as a deadline for re-performance (correcting deficiencies and resubmitting the deliverable).  There shall be no constructive or inferred acceptance of any deliverable if the Government fails to meet the review deadline; however, in such cases an equitable adjustment to the delivery schedule may be granted.  A deliverable that does not fully satisfy a requirement could also be subject to acceptance with a penalty, e.g., an equitable price reduction for the deliverable or other consideration deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer.

The Government also reserves the right to monitor the Contractors performance in accordance with its proper authority and contractual rights.  Authorized Government personnel may visit the appropriate work area of the Contractor and may either observe the Contractor performing the tasks or review documentation, as appropriate.  Monitoring may also include analysis of the key personnel hours expended as reported in the monthly reports submitted.  If key personnel hours show significant deviation below projected hours as detailed in the Offerors proposal, it could trigger an on-site inspection or other compliance actions.  The COTR may also conduct evaluations to check compliance with the Contractor's approved quality control plan.

Section K: Representations, certifications, and other statements of offerors or respondents

52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (May 2008)
(a)
(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --
(A) Are * are not * presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have * have not *, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
(C) Are * are not * presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and
(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(2) Examples.
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
(2) Principals, for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions).
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

Section M: Proposal Evaluation Criteria
M.1   General

a. The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), part 15.

b. In accordance with FAR 52.215 1 (f), the Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offerors whose proposals represent the best value.  Per FAR Part 2, best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The Government will conduct the best value analysis using the factors listed in Section M.3.  In performing its best value analysis, the Government will compare any relevant differences among the evaluated proposals to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.  This effort will include comparing the strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with each offer.  

c. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with offerors except clarifications if necessary as described in FAR 15.306(a) and will evaluate each offer on the basis of the offeror's initial proposal. Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors' best terms from a technical and price standpoint.

d. When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by offerors in their proposals, as well as data obtained from other sources.  Each offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.  
M.2   Basis for Award

The Government will make an award to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value based on the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.4.

FSA has established a Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to evaluate proposals submitted for this acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated by the TEB members in accordance with the procedures contained in FAR part 15, and the Evaluation Factors hereinafter described.
M.3   Technical Evaluation Factors for Award

Proposals will be rated and ranked on evaluation factors listed below.  Proposals are evaluated based on information in the proposal.  All technical evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  But as technical proposals approach parity, price will become more important.  The proposed prices will be evaluated separately but in conjunction with the technical proposal elements.  A proposed price that is considered by the Government to be too low to accomplish the proposed technical approach may constitute a potential performance risk to the Government in terms of quality and ability to meet delivery schedules.
M.4   Proposal Evaluation Factors (in descending order of importance)
M.4.1	Technical Approach

This factor evaluates the Offerors Technical Approach for an analysis of the potential long-term implications of climate change on crop insurance and the development of a program impact model that incorporates the impacts identified to the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA).  Aspects that will be considered include analytical rigor, use of appropriate statistical methods, and knowledge of crop insurance.  Corporate expertise will be evaluated based upon the submitted reports the contractor has completed on climate change impacts to any type of insurance, and climate change models on insurance agreements (The submitted reports can be submitted as part of the contractors appendix and therefore is not included in the page limitation for the proposal submission). Key Personnel will be evaluated based on the individual skills, education, and experience of the key personnel proposed for this project.  Individual team member listings shall be limited to one page, utilizing at least 12-point font.
M.4.2	Project Management Plan (WBS, delivery schedule & Quality Control Plan):

Proposals that demonstrate the most effective, efficient and optimal technique to meet the criteria outlined in the solicitation for listed goals, objectives, and requirements found in section C will receive a higher evaluation.
M.4.3	Past Performance:

On this factor the Government will evaluate the quality of previous work products the Offeror and its key personnel have produced.  Offerors that combine greater professional competence with a demonstrated ability to deliver consistently high quality products will receive a higher evaluation.  Aspects to be considered include the customers perspective on:

	Usefulness and value of the services and products delivered (e.g., recommendations in previous work products are generally adopted);
	The key objectives and initial intent of the contracts are met (customer expectations);
	Previous work products contained relatively few substantial deficiencies, and the requested corrections are quickly and correctly made or satisfactorily explained; and
	Previous work products contained detailed, logical, and insightful analysis and recommendation, use of appropriate statistical methods, insight into potential program vulnerabilities, etc.
M.5	Price Evaluation

The Government will evaluate the following areas:
(a)  Price Reasonableness:  The proposal will be evaluated to determine reasonableness of the price.  A comparison of the proposed prices, Independent Government Cost Estimate, and/or market values will be used to evaluate price.  Should price competition not exist, a cost analysis may be necessary to establish price reasonableness.

(b)  Price Realism:  The Offerors are placed on notice that any offers that are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of contract requirements and may be grounds for rejection of the offer.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide information to all offerors.

The government understands that sample matrix sensitivity is dependent on what sample is used. Offers to include stated sensitivities for the elements stated in the solicitation and what standard was used.

Questions and answers.

1. What size pellet press do you need? Do you need manual or an automatic press? Do you need dies for use with it? If so, for the maximum size pellet our system can analyze?  What other details can you supply regarding your press needs? 

Response-The government wants to see what the vendors are willing to include. Probably manual with multiple size dies appropriate for your equipment.

2. You would like us to show results from some NIST standard to show detection limits for various elements with our system. I spoke with one of our application specialists and they are not aware of any standard that would cover the full range of elements from C-U. Would submitting a few results from different standards covering a percentage of the elemental range be sufficient to demonstrate our analytical capabilities? 

Response-Yes to the latter since there are not NIST standards for all elements.  The government wants to know performance (sensitivity) and wants to leave it up to the offerors to provide the government with that information. We did list several elements that the government specifically requires information on.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the procurement of commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-08-Q-300029 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside.  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees. This synopsis/solicitation is issued for a firm-fixed-price for the overhaul of C130H NOSE LANDING GEAR STRUTS, NSN-1620-00-505-1184, Part Number 3303591-3, the quantity of 4, which will include modifications in accordance with Air Force Technical Order 4S2-23-3, 4 (Mfg cage code 17576).

Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis.

Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work".  The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.  The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document.  Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule.

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSDDate: 06/23/2008Project: Rewrite and Edit Fact SheetsDESCRIPTION OF WORK The NCPTSD Website (www.ncptsd.va.gov) contains 135 Fact Sheets (i.e., brief overviews of information) on a variety of topics related to PTSD and traumatic stress.  Specific audience groups were created as part of a major website re-design.  In addition the Center has begun the process of repackaging fact sheets originally written for professional audiences into material appropriate for the general public.  The expected cost of this acquisition's range is from $25,000 to $100,000.  Please contact Stacy Sullivan via e-mail for full RFP at stacy.sullivan@va.govFact sheets need to be presented in a way that will capitalize on adult learning strategies in order to increase the impact of the material on the reader.  We believe several steps are necessary to insure that fact sheets are appropriate for the general public, including veterans, other trauma survivors, and family members.1.	Fifty two (52) existing fact sheets for the general public need to be reviewed.  Content should be revised so that it is easy to understand and is engaging to our general audience.  This means that it needs to be both written at a 7th grade reading level and presented in a manner which is accessible to this audience.2.	Thirty six (36) fact sheets that currently serve as both lay and professional audience fact sheets need to be revised so that there is a specific version written for each audience group.  Again, information needs to be written at both the correct grade level and in a way that is accessible to the targeted audience.3.	Forty seven (47) fact sheets for professional audiences need to be reviewed.  Content should be revised so that it is presented in an easy to understand format that is suitable for a professional audience.4.	Finally, redundant content within audience groups needs to be identified and eliminated.  In some cases the content can be eliminated while in other cases content might be revised and included in other existing fact sheets.Fact sheets content can be supplied to the vendor in html format, or text can be pulled directly from the Website by the vendor.  A VA Education Specialist will work with the vendor to provide guidance on necessary changes and to review overall strategy for edits.   The vendor will accept up to three rounds of edits from the NCPTSD Executive Division.  Final fact sheets will be supplied by the vendor in a web-ready format as specified below. DELIVERABLES:Contractor will provide final revised educational materials in web-ready format, including at least 52 fact sheets for the general public, 36 fact sheets (that serve two audiences), need to be divided and written for each specific audience, and 47 fact sheets need to be reviewed and edited as needed for the professional audience.SKILLS NEEDEDThe contractor needs to be proficient in creating educational materials on health (and preferably mental health) for both a lay and professional audience.  This requires understanding of: how to translate research into practice, curriculum development, adult learning strategies, scientific writing, and social marketing.  Contractor must be familiar with VA/Government 508 compliance regulations so that fact sheets can be delivered in a web-ready format.

<DESC>Applicability of Authority: The required items are available only from one responsible source and are the only product of its type that meets OSHA, DOT, NAFPA requirements. The F.O.D. Control Corporation is the sole distributor of this product to military installations. The purchased items will be used for runway debris removal. Seymour Johnson currently utilizes many of the FOD Boss products. Purchasing any other brand would result in total reconstruction of our FOD control efforts as well as unacceptable noncompliance with OSHA, DOT, or NFPA mandated requirements. Award to any other source would result in unnecessary costs as the government would have to replace operational equipment. The government has already spent $46,870.00 in FOD BOSS equipment since the year 2006. The duplication of costs is not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

<DESC>Modification 3 TO BAA 08-08
Synthetic Aperture LADAR for Tactical Imaging
(SALTI)

(U)  The purpose of Modification 3 to BAA08-08 (SALTI) is to make the following changes:

1.  (U)  Page 5, Section 1.1.1 entitled Phase 4: System Design and Demonstration is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.1 (U) Phase 4: System Design, Development and Validation

(U) During Phase 4, the contractor shall design, develop and test the critical components and subsystems, and then integrate them into a brassboard  system for field testing on a contractor-supplied test aircraft.  These field tests will be designed and executed to validate the program metrics (see Section 1.2 of this BAA) under various atmospheric conditions.  The goal of Phase 4 is to verify the resolution at range requirements cited in program metrics in a configuration compatible with customer needs and able to compensate for aero-optics effects and any atmospheric effects induced by turbulence and atmospheric particulates, i.e., haze.  The intent is to identify any remaining issues and resolve them prior to the Phase 5 POD design and fabrication.   Testing will validate all specified program metrics, as well as validate the SALTI system model predictions using atmospheric parameters obtained during field testing. 

(U) This aforementioned design should be compatible with a military-certifiable POD, but the brassboard does not have to be packaged into a POD for Phase 4 testing and demonstration.  Specifically, the brassboards size, weight and power (SWAP) should show traceability towards a seamless integration into the contractor-proposed POD, but is not expected to completely meet POD SWAP. 

(U) Phase 4 will have four major tasks that will lead to a successful flight testing and demonstration.  They are: (1) POD Preliminary Design; (2) Critical component and sub-systems analysis, development and testing; (3) SAL image processing; and (4) and flight testing in a sample relevant environment. 

(U)  The Contractor shall develop a Preliminary Design for the proposed POD system as well as a detailed systems model and its accompanying analyses to show the proposed systems potential to meet program metrics in a POD configuration.  Based on these analyses, the Contractor shall develop a Systems Requirement Document (SRD) for the proposed POD system that will identify critical technical performance and identify critical technology elements.  Data Collection flights

2.  (U) All references to Conceptual Design should be changed to Preliminary Design.  Specifically,
	
	a.  Page 5, Section 1.1.1., second and third paragraph
	b.  Page 6, Section 1.1.1.1
	c.  Page 6, Section 1.1.1.1.1
	d.  Page 7, Section 1.1.1.1.4
	d.  Page 7, Section 1.1.1.2.1
	e.  Page 7, Section 1.1.1.3.1

3. (U)  Page 6, Section 1.1.1.1.2 entitled System Performance and Signature/Imaging Modeling and Analysis, is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.1.1.2 (U) System Performance and Signature/Imaging Modeling and Analysis

(U) A complete systems model is required to predict sensor performance in the presence of atmospheric effects for both the Phase 4 test aircraft and final POD configuration.  This model should include aero-optics effects and those effects induced by atmospheric turbulence and particulates, i.e., Haze.   For all predictive analyses, the Contractor shall use typical atmospheric visibilities such as 10, 25 and 50 statute miles, and the 0.2x, 1x and 5x Huffnagle-Valley 5/7 atmospheric models ,  (see figure 1 for comparison of these models against Korean atmospheric data. 
 
(U) Figure 1 Multiples of Huffnagle-Valley Model Compared To Korean Turbulence
 
(U) The Contractor shall demonstrate a systems model, validated by laboratory and field testing results from the previous SALTI Phases as well as data taken during Phase 4.  This model must, as a minimum, include objective platform-based environmental factors.  Signature/imaging models will be developed to predict sensor performance based on sensor platforms and targets expected to be seen during field testing and validation.  These should include both intra-beam and sub-swath image prediction.  Both the performance and signature models will be delivered to the Government at appropriate periodic intervals during contract.    

4.  (U) Page 6, Section 1.1.1.1.4 entitled Data Collection Flights is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.1.1.4 (U) Data Collection Flights

(U) Flight tests of a SAL sensor shall be conducted during Phase 4 to validate SALTI signature/imaging and system models, as well as verifying relevant program metrics can be met.   Key to this validation is formation of SAL images using existing/upgraded SALTI from Phase 3 and preceding SALTI testing.  The Contractor shall identify potential ranges for field testing and demonstration selection for unambiguous validation of SALTI models, predictions and program metrics.  The Contractor also will identify any safety and testing issues, e.g., eye safety, flight safety, that need resolution and will work with the Government to resolve before flight testing.  The Contractor shall develop a draft test plan for a set of proposed testing and demonstration for unambiguous validation of SALTI models, predictions and program metrics, and submit it to the Government for approval prior to any field tests.  This test plan shall include proposed measurements from which the strength of atmospheric turbulence along the path and the integrated extinction due to Haze can be estimated. This data will also be used for improving SALTI image formation and processing algorithms. 

(U) As noted above, atmospheric characteristics / ground truth data taken during Phase 4 field testing shall be used in the referenced SALTI model to predict system performance and compared to SALTI measurements obtained during said tests.  The goal is to show good agreement between experiment, models and the relevant program metrics.  The Contractor will identify all ground truthing requirements, and is responsible for obtaining this equipment for the Phase 4 field trials.  If such equipment is available from the government, the Contractor can propose its use as GFE in said field trials.  However, the government is under no obligation to provide, and the Contractor needs to determine alternate sources.  

5.  (U)  Page 7, Section 1.1.1.2.1 entitled Critical Technology Identification is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.1.2.1 (U) Critical Technology Identification

(U) Based on the Preliminary Design for the proposed POD configuration, the Contractor shall identify and document the critical technologies, components and sub-systems, necessary to achieve the required performance specified in the program metrics section.   Identification and documentation shall be provided at a level sufficient to allow detailed evaluation of these subsystems by expert reviewers.  All claims to prior performance demonstration of components (ie. laser systems, detectors, etc) shall be documented.  The Contractor shall benchmark in detail the State-of-the-Art (SOA) for each and provide documentation supporting SOA claims, identify the technical challenges (if any) for maturing it to the level necessary for the SALTI Phase 4 brassboard integration, and outline the WBS tasking and budget (if any) needed to meet these challenges on the proposed Phase 4 schedule.  The Contractor shall consider as a minimum, but not limited to, the following areas as critical to SALTI:  lasers, circulators, detectors, pointing and tracking, payload stabilization, aero-optics effects, vibration and motion compensation, auto-focus algorithms, atmospheric and aero-optics effects compensation, signal processing, and data acquisition and storage systems.  Such documentation is especially vital for critical path items such as laser systems, for which sufficient detail must be provided to allow evaluation of laser concepts by Government experts.  For example, laser system design should be specified at sufficient level to allow evaluation of projected performance parameters such as power, linewidth, beam quality, and electrical efficiency in the presence of physical processes that constrain these parameters.  All claims with regard to previous demonstration(s) must be substantiated in detail. 

(U) As noted above, the brassboards SWAP should show traceability towards a seamless integration into the contractor-proposed POD, but is not expected to completely meet POD SWAP.  The Contractor shall provide a road map for how all mismatched critical components and subsystems can be fixed, changed, or modified to meet POD SWAP requirements.  The Contractor will have to demonstrate operation of all critical components and subsystems individually and in the integrated brassboard in the laboratory before flight testing can occur.

6.  (U) Page 18, Section 4.3.1.1 Volume I, Technical and Management Proposal, Section III, Detailed Proposal Information, G is replaced in its entirety  to address EVM:

(U) Management Approach:  Describe management approach and identify formal teaming agreements that are required to execute this program.  The plan should include an organization chart and a summary that describes programmatic relationship of team members, their unique capabilities, task responsibilities, and the teaming strategy among the team members.  Additionally, describe the approach for system engineering, assessing and managing cost, technical, and schedule risk to include commercially acceptable Earned Value Management techniques, the method of assessing and managing progress towards achieving programmatic goals and metrics, the extent of participation of small and disadvantaged businesses, and use of a  secure Integrated Digital Environment.

7.  (U) Page 22, Section 4.4.1 entitled Proposal Date, inner envelope, change the ATTN line to read as follows: 

ATTN:  STO/Dr. L. B. Stotts, Room 328.

8.   (U)  Page 23, Section 5.1.1 entitled Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, is replaced in its entirety with the following:

 (U) OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT

(U) The proposers Overall Scientific and Technical Merit will be evaluated to determine the extent that the effort will meet the program objectives and goals.  Specifically, the proposer must show a credible technical approach to achieving the program goals; objectives and performance metrics (see Section 1.2).   The four critical sub-factors to be evaluated in assessing the credability of the technical approach are the technology SOA assessment maturity and validation levels of the proposed SALTI model, which should include all degrading system effects, the system engineering analysis of proposed approach, and credibility of proposed cost and schedule. At a minimum, the following items should be provided for evaluation:

	(U) SOA:  The proposal shall benchmark the SOA for critical component and sub-system for the Preliminary Design, identify the technical challenges (if any) for maturing it to the level necessary for the SALTI Phase 4 brassboard integration, and outline the WBS tasking and budget (if any) needed to meet these challenges on the proposed Phase 4 schedule.   All technical claims made in the proposal will be expected to have accompanying data to verify such claims, with sufficient description on how measurements were made, under what conditions, and all the values of the relevant ancillary parameters and or metrics, at the time of the measurements.

	(U) SALTI Systems Model:  The proposer shall describe the SOA SALTI system model used in developing the proposal and outline how it was validated by laboratory and field testing results from the previous SALTI Phases.  This model should include aero-optics and atmospheric turbulence effects, and their compensation, clearly identified in model.

	(U) Prediction of SALTI performance:  A complete systems model will be used to predict sensor performance in the presence of atmospheric effects for proposed designs associated with both the Phase 4 test aircraft and final POD configuration.  A complete system link budget should be included in the proposal for both the Phase 4 testing and POD design.  The system engineering analyses should include aero-optics effects and those effects induced by atmospheric turbulence and particulates, i.e., Haze.   For proposal, the Contractor shall use typical atmospheric visibilities such as 10, 25 and 50 statute miles, and the 0.2x, 1x and 5x Huffnagle-Valley 5/7 atmospheric models2, 3.   Power Spectrum Density data for the Phase 4 test aircraft and the expected AF fighter should be identified and used in this analyses.

	(U) Performance/Cost/Schedule:  The proposer will be evaluated on creditability of achieving the programs goals, objectives and program metrics within the cost and schedule.  All subcontractor WBS tasking and budget should be reflected in the proposers overall Master Schedule and Budget.  

(U) The contactor should demonstrate a clear and broad understanding of all the critical technical issue in making a SALTI a deployed capability in the USAF, and the degrees of technical innovation in the technical approach should be clearly articulated. 

9.  (U) Page 24, Section 5.1.3 entitled Management Approach, is replaced in its entirety with the following:

(U)	The proposal must show effective and responsible management of both people and information resources needed to execute the program.  Management plans must accommodate Government visibility into key technical activities, interaction with key personnel, and single point responsibility for contract performance.  Technical, administrative, and financial accountability must be evident from the management and reporting structure.  Roles of the prime Contractor and all other participants should be delineated and adequately described and formal agreements documented.  Any participation by or use of Government personnel and property must be identified.  Intellectual property issues must be adequately addressed.  In particular, the following items will be considered and evaluated:
(U)	System Engineering Plan and management approach
(U)	Cost Risk assessment and management approach
(U)	Technical Risk assessment and management approach
(U)	Schedule Risk assessment and management approach
(U)	Method of assessing and managing progress towards achieving programmatic goals and metrics
(U)	Use of a secure Integrated Environment
(U)   Earned Value Management (EVM) and management approach

10.  (U) Page 27, Section  6.2.1 entitled Security, change the Attn: line to read as follows: 

ATTN:  STO/Dr. L. B. Stotts, Room 328.

Description:
NAICS Code: 493110   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to procure warehouse services for the management of its equipment and supply inventories located at its warehouse facilities in San Francisco and Los Angeles, CA, using negotiated contracting procedures under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  This procurement is a total set-aside for SBA-certified small business concerns under the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) program only.  A separate solicitation will be made available within 30 days from the publication date of this notice.
This requirement is for the management of equipment and supplies owned by EPA Region 9, for use by its Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The contractor will be responsible for providing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week readiness of all materials and equipment in the warehouse in support of the EPA On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) and its environmental response contractor network. The contractor will be required to perform inventory control, track and schedule necessary maintenance according to manufacturer?s recommendations, and allow for one hour availability of vehicles, equipment, or supplies when requested by an OSC. Other than minor maintenance or cleaning, the contractor will not be required to perform scheduled maintenance of equipment or any major cleaning or calibrations. The contractor will use an electronic system already in place to track inventories at these facilities.
The San Francisco warehouse is located within the City of San Francisco and is approximately 6000 square feet. It contains a response vehicle and a trailer, electronic or scientific equipment, and consumable supplies used at the sites of environmental cleanups. The Los Angeles warehouse holds a  vehicle, equipment, and supplies. The warehouse will be at a location to be determined within the Los Angeles metropolitan area and is anticipated to be approximately 6000 square feet in area. 
The contract will be placed by Region 5, located in Chicago, IL, and administered by Region 9, located in San Francisco.  The EPA expects to award the contract on or about September 30, 2008 with the period of performance to begin December 1, 2008.  The contract will be a performance-based, fixed price (with cost reimbursable line items) type of contract.  The contract will have a one year base and four one year options. The majority of work under this contract will be performed at the warehouse locations; some incidental travel in the performance of the contract may be required in the immediate area (post office, etc.).  In emergency situations, as determined by the OSC or PO, it is anticipated that delivery of emergency response vehicles, equipment, and supplies to emergency response locations will be required. 
The contractor will be required to submit all personnel working under this contract for security clearance under HSPD-12 procedures, details of which can be found at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/forum/oct2007/epass.pdf

**** 1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of three, Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for large projects, primarily for Special Operations Forces.  These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence for the required work.  Offerors are cautioned to read this announcement in its entirety.  The contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Savannah District for use on federal projects under its jurisdiction and, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers District s within the SERO of IMA.  Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval.  Typically, the contracts will consist of three ordering schedules, each schedule not to exceed one year, for a total of three years maximum.  The total amount of each contract over the three-year ordering period may not exceed $4,500,000.  Task Orders will be primarily for large projects with a construction value greater than $2 million, however as required, smaller projects will be executed under these contracts.  These task orders are firm fixed price.     Projects to be designed are not yet determined and funds are not presently available.  Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based on the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, and (3) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts.  The NAICS is 541330; size standard $4.5 million.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  Small businesses are encouraged to team with other businesses.  The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.  Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum small business goals on the SF 330, Section C, by identifying subcontracting opportunities with small business.  If selected, the large business offeror will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 219.7704/705 as part of the Request for Proposal package.  The following subcontracting goals are the minimum acceptable goals to be included in the subcontracting plan.  Of the subcontracted work, 70% of the work would go to small business; 6.2% to small disadvantaged business (a composite of small business); 7.0% to women-owned business (a composite of small business); 9.8% to HUBZone small business (a composite of small business); 0.9% to service-disabled veteran-owned small business (a composite of small business and veteran-owned small business); and 3.0% to Veteran-owned small business (a composite of small business) .  Written justification must be provided if the minimum small business goals cannot be met.  The small business subcontracting plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFAR 19.7, Appendix DD.  The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.
