<ARCHDATE>05152008
<CONTACT>Christie VandenDries Contract Specialist 9077863415     christie_vandendries@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska intends to award a sole-source procurement to the State of Alaska, Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G)'s Kachemak Bay Research Reserve, to monitor radio-marked sea otters in the lower Cook Inlet including Kachemak and Kamishak Bays in connection with the Unusual Mortality Event of sea otters in this region. BACKGROUND Since 2002, the number of dead otters exceeds numbers recorded for the previous 20 years for the Kachemak Bay area.  Although sea otters strand for a variety of reasons (including disease, boat strikes, starvation, predation), this mortality event has an unusually high number of cases that have been diagnosed as having died from valvular endocarditis and/or septicemia. A bacteria called Streptococcus infantarius has been found in all of these otters.  Having a large proportion of animals die of a single infectious disease condition suggests some change in the system equilibrium, such as the introduction of a "new" disease into a previously naïve population.  In August of 2006, an Unusual Mortality Event (UME) was declared by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Unusual Mortality Event Working Group under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  To gain understanding of the impact and significance of this UME a number of studies are being implemented on northern sea otters in this area.  The highest reported incidence of the valvular endocarditis is being reported in the Kachemak Bay are which is managed as a National Estuarine Research Reserve in collaboration with the State of Alaska.   OBJECTIVES One avenue of research will involve capturing live sea otters in Kachemak and Kamishak Bays, Alaska.  The capture and radio-tracking efforts will improve our understanding of why these otters are dying and increase our knowledge of the current status, health and condition, ecology of the sea otter population.  Objectives include conducting specific tests for disease occurrence for sea otters and relating results to annual survival.  Data on population status and behavior patterns of sea otters will also be collected.   Award will be a Firm Fixed-Price contract with a Base Period and one Option Period. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received. Award will be made 15 days after the posting of this announcement. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to make a single award for professional services to support the MedSun program.   MedSun is a medical device adverse event reporting network. It is comprised of a primary network and several sub-networks. The primary network collects information on radiological devices generally, while the sub-networks collect information about specific classes of devices. The program involves investigation of the adverse events reported and providing feedback to the clinical community about the events and possible remedies thereto.  Currently 350 hospitals participate in the MedSun program, providing reports to both the primary network and sub-networks.

The purpose of the intended contract is twofold: to obtain assistance in the continued development of the program, and to process incoming reports and to analyze the data. 

With respect to program development, the contractor shall recruit and train participating sites, develop incentives plans to retain participating sites, and increase participation in sub-networks.  The contractor shall also maintain and market the MedSun websites, and administer, update and test the MedSun database.  The development of communication plans, small scale compliance evaluations, and rapid response surveys is also required. Additionally, the contractor shall advise the FDA on program related issues.

With respect to the processing of reports and data analysis, the contractor shall process incoming reports.  Processing the reports is not solely a clerical function, but requires the expertise to understand the reported events from a clinical and biomedical perspective.  The contractor shall also code the reports, analyze the reports, meet with the FDA to review reports, and perform follow-up to the reports as requested.  Additionally, the contractor shall assist the FDA in evaluating the impact of the MedSun program and shall develop methods to link data received to the demographics of the participating hospitals.

The contract is expected to consist of a one year base period, with four one year option periods.  The deliverables called for under the contract shall be provided according to the schedule set forth therein.  Some contractor employees will be required to work on-site at the FDA? facility located at 1350 Piccard Dr Rockville, MD 20850 ? others may work off-site.  It is anticipated that a written solicitation will be released on or about June 4, 2007.  Award will be made on or before September 21, 2007.  

All responsible sources may submit an offer, and the FDA will consider all offers submitted. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  The website for registration is www.ccr.gov.

The Payload must operate day and night , detect and recognize operationally-meaningful targets at survivable standoff ranges, determine range to target, autotrack and designate targets for precision-guided standoff weapons, provide target-location coordinates, and display continuous high-resolu tion imagery to the battlefield commander. The ability to provide such capabilities to the supported commander will greatly increase battlefield effectiveness. The ER/MP EO/IR/LD Payload shall have adequate on-board processing to perform autotracking, desi gnation, and to support the transmission of near-real-time motion imagery to the UAV ground control station (GCS) via the provided digital data link. The Equipment operates in day/night and adverse weather conditions providing imagery, target location, and  target designation. Imagery is provided by an Infrared (IR) sensor and an Electro-Optical (EO) color daylight camera. The IR sensor converts infrared scene radiation into a real time video signal. The EO presents a color image of the scene under daylight viewing conditions. The video from each of the Equipment imaging sensors can be viewed as separate video streams. Sensor video is available to external systems in analog and digital format. The capability to designate targets for laser guided munitions is provided by the Laser Designator (LD). An Eyesafe Laser Rangefinder (ELRF) is included in the Equipment and provides target range. Control and status are provided through a MIL-STD-1553 data bus and through symbology for maintenance purposes.

VISIBLE (EO) IMAGER PERFORMANCE: The EO sensor function consist s of the targeting EO camera with discrete FOVs and the search EO camera with continuous zoom. Both cameras shall be capable of outputting monochrome or color imagery. Both cameras shall have switchable visible and NIR filters. SEARCH MODES: Search modes s hall utilize the back scan capabilities of the Image Motion Compensation (IMC) mirrors, as required, to stabilize the LOS during the sampling interval used by the sensors. The video sampling and processing shall be synchronized with the LOS processing so t hat pixel smear does not occur. Imagery resolution for the search modes shall be adequate to perform Johnson criteria recognition. Search mode performance shall be evaluated at a reference altitude to 15,000 feet, slant range of 7.3 km, and aircraft speed of 70 knots. The search pattern control parameters shall take into account the FOV locations on a flat earth, the reference azimuth and depression angles, platform position (lat/long/alt), and velocity vector at the start of the search mode. The resulting snapshot loca tions shall not have any gaps between snapshots. ANALOG VIDEO OUTPUTS: Analog video shall be in accordance with SMPTE 170M. The color burst information shall be suppres sed for monochrome sources. The Equipment shall allow the selection of any of the video streams for output on the three analog video outputs. The Equipment shall also allow any two of the streams to be output to any combination of the 3 analog video output s. The Equipment output video shall be selectable between IR and EO. DIGITAL VIDEO OUTPUTS: The Equipment shall provide IEEE-1394A digital serial video data output. The Equipment shall allow the selection of any of the video streams for output on the two s erial digital video outputs.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  
It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to negotiate on a sole source basis with BAC/PAC Resources Children?s Hospital Oakland, 747 52ND Street, Oakland, CA 94609, to purchase genomic DNA Library resources.  The products to be purchased are all BAC/PAC genomic DNA Library resources that are offered to academic and scientific research institutes on a cost recovery basis. The period of performance will consist of four (4) months.  The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the use of DNA clones from BAC/PAC Resources Children?s Hospital Oakland have been used over the past five years and are needed for an ongoing project that is comparatively mapping the human genome with evolutionary interesting species. The clones from BACPAC are for a variety of species. Various Universities and Organizations deposit their DNA clones with BAC/PAC as they are developed. BACPAC then creates filter sets and maintains them and are responsible for distribution to the end users.  To maintain accurate and consistent test results the same vendor must continue to be utilized and can not be substituted by another vendor. To do so would introduce new variables into the experimental results creating incorrect interpretation of the test results already in progress. Awarding to another vendor would also result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339999 and the Size Standard is 500 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this notice.  All responses should include a firm fixed price; documentation of the capabilities of meeting the government requirements; at least three references documenting successful past performance in meeting Government minimum specifications; a proposed delivery schedule; prompt payment discount terms; the DUN & Bradstreet number (DUNS); the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); and the offerors business size.  The submission will be evaluated on the content of the above documents.  The offeror must also register in the Governments Contractor Registry System, Note: www.ccr.gov.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.  

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-HG-2007-144-KLW may be submitted by mail to the National Heart Lung, and Blood Institute, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Kesha Williams, by fax transmission to (301) 480-3345 or by email to williamk@nhlbi.nih.gov all responsible sources may submit information, which if received timely, shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). The Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent and Landing Instrumentation (MEDLI) project has the unique opportunity to place engineering measurement devices on the heatshield of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) vehicle, scheduled for launch in 2009.  Obtaining valuable data about the Mars entry environment will help validate aerothermal and ablative materials models, lowering the risk for future robotic and human missions to Mars. The instrument complement for MEDLI includes temperature, ablation, and pressure measurement devices.  The Sensor Support Electronics unit conditions the signals from various sensors, performs the analog to digital conversion, and passes serial data to the Rover.	The digital interface with the Rover and the controls of analog circuitries are implemented on a FPGA. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the FPGA from Actel Corporation as they are the only known source that can provide the FPGA that meets all of NASA LaRC's specifications. The Actel FPGA meets the following specifications in order to survive launch, cruise and entry into the atmosphere of Mars.  The FPGA can withstand a Total Ionizing Dose (TID) of less than 20Krad, it is latch up immune and can survive a single event upset of greater than &gt; 36 MeV-cm2/mg.	In addition it has a storage temperature range of -65 oC to +150 oC and an operational temperature of -55 oC to +125 oC. Because the chips that interact with the FPGA operate on 5V power the FPGA shall also be 5V compliant. A preliminary design of the logic to be programmed into the FPGA showed that a chip with 91,000 system gates and at least 1,800 registers is required. The number of gates and registers do include margin if the design changes.  The FPGA will be used for spaceflight and shall be compliant with the QML Military Standard MIL-PRF-38535 and shall have a product flow of QML class Q.   Authority for the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is provided by FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (PL 104-106, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as amended by PL 109-163, Section 1443 of the FY 2006 National Defense Authorization Act). This authority is available for use in acquiring commercial items not exceeding $5.5 million. The Actel Corporation, is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 23, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The goal of ONR BAA #07-014 is to develop multi-INT sensors, tags/taggants for tracking and locating entities of interest, and sensor communications technologies to provide battlespace awareness (BA) and alerting at the lowest tactical levels (i.e., team, squad, patrol, etc).  The objective is to provide Expeditionary forces with the sensing and tracking capabilities needed in irregular warfare against an asymmetric threat. 

The BAA is structured around the following thrust areas:  Developing smart agile tactical sensors capable of fulfilling specific expeditionary mission objectives; developing smart tags and taggants to track and locate entities of interest, tag readers, and algorithms that can characterize normal and suspicious tracks; and creating a communications architecture for the tactical sensor network   

White Papers are encouraged prior to submitting a full proposal.  White papers will be evaluated to determine whether an offeror is encouraged to make an oral presentation of its white paper to a panel of government evaluators.  An offeror may submit a full proposal without submitting a white paper or making an oral presentation.

Approximately $17M is available in FY08 for efforts over a 1-3 year timeframe.  ONR plans to issue an annual BAA for this program.  The total funding for the program is anticipated to be $49M during FY08-FY12.

	There is no prohibition against a firm participating in both the RAC full and open competition and the RAC small set-aside.  All proposals will be evaluated in an identical manner and in accordance with specified evaluation criteria.   The Government does not envision awarding contracts to a respective firm that would be the Prime or Sub-contractor in both the full and open and the set-aside procurements.  Pursuant to FAR 36.6, the source selection official has the latitude to consider selection of another of the ranked offerers.  Rationale for considering such action could be the Governments goal to provide alternate sources for its requirements, including the mitigation and management of conflict of interest (COI) issues.  In the event that firms propose under a joint venture agreement, both firms must demonstrate the ability to implement the requirements of the tasks described in the Statement of Work independently. 

	The EPA Region 9 is not going to hold a pre-proposal conference.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, the RFP will be posted shortly on the EPA web site for informational purposes only.  A bidders list will not be provided or posted.  Following EPA's review of the SF 330, a "short list" of the most highly rated firms will be developed.  Short listed firms will be referred to as "selected firms."  Selected firms will be invited to participate in oral presentations.  The specific details on the oral presentations will only be provided to the selected firms.  Selected offerors should be aware that their overall rating depends on both written submissions and their oral presentations.  Following oral presentations, the proposals will then be ranked and the source selection authority will make the final selection from among those firms.  The most highly rated firm will be asked to submit a cost proposal, Conflict of Interest Plan, Quality Management Plan, Representations and Certifications, and Subcontracting Plan.  The contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation and tracking of costs.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory, Precision Engineering Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Agilent Technologies, Inc., of Englewood, CO for a PCI Three Axis Laser Board with external sampling and API Library Software and Monitor Program.

Sole source determination is based on the following: Agilent Technologies is the only manufacturer of the N1231B PCI Three Axis Laser Board. The Agilent N1231B PCI Three-Axis Laser Board will be used to acquire data from HP laser interferometers.  The laser interferometer system is part of a measuring microscope system on which photomask calibrations are performed. The Agilent N1231B board is the only board capable of acquiring data from our HP laser interferometer systems because HP spun off their test and measurement division, which included their laser interferometer systems, to Agilent Technologies in 1999. This equipment must be 100% plug-in compatible with NIST?s existing HP 5501B and HP 5517B laser interferometers systems NIST currently owns. The only way to guarantee complete plug-in compatibility and interchangeability is to purchase the N1231B PCI Three Axis Laser Board from Agilent Technologies. Agilent does not have any distributors or resellers of the N1231B PCI Three Axis Laser Board.
No solicitation package will be issued. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by June 2, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Please note that the solicitation document "may" (instead of "will") contain information that has been designated as "Military Critical Technical Data" and the solicitation will identify how (and if) contractors may obtain a copy of any specific portions of the solicitation.  Also note that the sole source contractor's (Northrop Grumman Amherst System's) Cage Code is "1L4J7), instead of "IL4J7."  The requirements of this acquisition (applicable to Wideband Threat Emitter Kits) can not be contractually awarded to foreign contractors. Except for the changes/clarifications identified herein, all other previously posted information remains unchanged.  Reminder: The Government intends on using Integrated Product Team (IPT) Pricing, with the sole source contractor, from the time of solicitation issuance.  Therefore, the solicitation that gets posted (electronically) will not be complete, but will only be adequate for immediately beginning IPT pricing with the sole source contractor. The Government will award a bilaterally agreed-to contract (using IPT Pricing) to the sole source contractor.

Under this contract, contractor will prepare and analyze further samples and share them with NIOSH researchers for  Raman and Photoluminescence Spectroscopic analysis.  Contractor will, in addition, share the AFM results with NIOSH personnel and collaborate in the interpretation of AFM and Raman and Photoluminescence results.  


Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Rebecca Mullenax, Reference 000HCCCD-2007-42949, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or E-mail rmullenax@cdc.gov  or fax to 304-285-6083.

The Grantee, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development of Tanzania, invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to support the Ministry of Infrastructure Development in developing a National ICT Backbone Network including a detailed study of projected traffic to be carried over the Tanzania-anchored regional backhaul networks to and from the submarine cables. The National ICT backbone network will increase direct regional communications capacity and global connectivity at a much lower price than current satellite circuits.

Tanzania does not have a national long distance network that connects its major population centers to smaller towns, rural areas, or national border points with its neighbors.  To alleviate this problem, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development is planning to implement a Tanzania National ICT Backbone Network. The backbone network will also form the foundation for a Tanzania-anchored regional backhaul network by providing connectivity and international links from the proposed submarine cable landing station in Dar es Salaam to regional backhaul networks with neighboring countries on Tanzania?s border. 

As the Grantee, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development will oversee the Feasibility Study. The Ministry will be supported by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Agency (TCRA), which will take the lead in developing the regulatory framework for the project, in particular ensuring open access, a fair and competitive pricing environment, and interconnection guidelines for the Tanzania National ICT Backbone.

The Terms of Reference for the Grant include the following tasks:

Task 1:  Conduct a Requirement Analysis of the Tanzania National ICT Backbone and Interconnection Points to Regional Backhaul Networks
Task 2:  Market Analysis and Traffic Study Specifications
Task 3: Develop Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs for the Tanzania National ICT Backbone
Task 4:  Business and Financial Model 
Task 5:  Regulatory Framework 
Task 6:  Development Impact Assessment 
Task 7:  Environmental Impact Assessment

<DESC>Maintenance, Repair and Operational (MRO) Management Program Services at Tinker AFB, Ok

In accordance with FAR10.001, the government is conducting market research to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 

The Government will use the information gathered in response to this document to refine acquisition strategy for integrated service solutions. 

The government has approximately 120 Nexiant point-of-use industrial plant equipment in place today and is planning to have an estimated number of 400 when installation is complete. The equipment will be located in 40+ buildings. 

The MRO materials to be stocked include but are not limited to consumables, expendables and personal protection equipment items at each location.  The Government plans to have one provider for all locations and applications. The services to be provide include (1) Manage Nexiant point-of-use applications (equipment) at specified buildings and locations; (2) Purchase, Deliver, Stock and Replenish all MRO materials and inventory within point-of-use applications, (equipment); (3) Maintain, Cycle Count and Manage all inventory with point-of-use applications (equipment) and virtual cribs. 4) Process, expedite, and follow-up on spot buys and purchases, and; (5) Provide inventory and category management services.  For informational purposes only the Government is requesting answers to the following questions:

1. Does your company perform Inventory Management as described above for commercial Industry? Please provide a brief description of the scope of that effort. Can you provide copies of these contracts or Point of Contacts to obtain additional information?

2. Do you provide this or a similar service to a government entity? Which government entity and what are the contract numbers or Point of Contacts?

3. What type of a contract (Firm fixed price, Cost plus fixed fee, Time and Materials etc) would provide the Government the best service and work best for your company to supply this integrated service? Do you have any that are gain or profit/cost reduction

4. If we have a requirement for one-time spot buys for existing Industrial Production Equipment do you have experience with performing this type of service or buy? What type of CLIN structure would you use for this type of requirement?

5. Have you been involved with or used an automated point-of-use system? If yes, please describe the extent and details of that experience. Please list the types of equipment and the manufacturer that youve used.

6. It is unclear what the full scope of an Inventory Product Service requirement will look like at 76MXW over the next year. However, the Government has a partial perspective of what is currently in place. How would you plan for fluctuations in the requirement workload (with only partial history)for a procurement of this nature?

7.  How would you propose to add items and locations as they grow?

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the Coordinating Center (TNCC) for ??Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet?? (TrialNet) that will be responsible for communication and coordination among the Clinical Centers and for management of the collection and analysis of genetic, immunologic, pathogenetic, clinical and biological data from the clinical sites. The TNCC will also be responsible for:  (1) support of study protocols and Manuals of Operation for each TrialNet trial, (2) maintaining the TrialNet website, and (3) organizing TrialNet Steering Committee meetings, DSMB (DSMB) meetings, EAB meetings and workshops.  In addition, the TNCC will be responsible for transferring all data and biosamples that are the property of NIDDK to the appropriate NIDDK repositories.

This acquisition will be solicited with minimum and maximum requirement. Award of this acquisition will be contingent on the availability of funds. All offerors will be required to submit a minimum and maximum proposal for fulfilling the requirements.

TrialNet, an international consortium of clinical research groups with expertise in type 1 diabetes (T1D) research, was created to carry out randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trials aimed at evaluating therapies for T1D prevention and early intervention.  Principal researchers in the consortium include both a clinical diabetologist and a leading immunologist from each major Clinical Center.  The TrialNet study group consists of a Biostatistics (Data and Operations) Coordinating Center, a Chairman??s Office, 6 Core Laboratories, a Compounding Pharmacy, 14 North American Clinical Centers, 15 North American Major Affiliate Centers, 84 North American Affiliate Centers, 4 International Clinical Centers, and 16 International Affiliate Centers.  In addition, TrialNet mechanistic studies are being performed in collaboration with the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  The primary goal of TrialNet is to conduct studies designed to evaluate new approaches to prevent or ameliorate T1D specifically by interdicting the T1D disease process. These include interventions designed to decrease ?]-cell destruction and/or enhance ?]-cell survival.  TrialNet researchers hope that preservation of remaining ?]-cells will delay or prevent the onset of disease in at-risk individuals and will make disease control easier in individuals with new onset T1D.  Optimal diabetes control is important because studies have clearly demonstrated that tight control results in fewer long-term complications (such as blindness, kidney failure, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease).  Other TrialNet goals include (1) further characterization of diabetes risk through genetic, autoantibody, and metabolic studies in subjects identified through the Natural History, and (2) intervention studies to further develop new therapeutics through a better understanding of the immunologic bases of diabetes by analysis of serum, RNA, DNA, and cell function in at-risk and new-onset subjects as well as controls.

TrialNet has completed one clinical research study (MMTT versus GST), is in the midst of six active studies (Natural History, MMF/DZB, Anti-CD20, T Cell, NIP, and Oral Insulin) and will launch four more by the end of 2007 (Anti-CD3+Exenatide, Metabolic Control, Thymoglobulin [with ITN as lead], and IL2+Rapamycin [with ITN as lead]).  Other trials have been approved but a decision to launch has not been made due to uncertainty about available funds. TrialNet also works closely with the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium, regularly supplying them with blood samples for their studies aimed at a better understanding of the genetic basis of T1D.

The completed study (MMTT versus GST), comparing the Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) to the Glucagon Stimulation Test (GST), was aimed at supporting the establishment of C-peptide as a reliable surrogate outcome measure for diabetes trials.  The study was designed to determine the best method for assessing insulin production during T1D clinical trials.  138 subjects, each within 3 years of diagnosis of T1D, underwent 2 MMTTs and 2 GSTs in random order within a 6 week period.  Results showed that peak C-peptide levels were significantly higher during the MMTT, indicating that detection of a C-peptide response would be more likely with the MMTT compared to the GST.  Correlation data revealed that both tests were highly reproducible, but the MMTT was significantly more reproducible than the GST.

One of the ongoing TrialNet studies is the Natural History Study.  Relatives of type 1 diabetics are recruited into the Natural History study based on HLA genotype and on the presence of certain diabetes-associated autoantibodies in the blood.  Subjects with one or more different type of diabetes autoantibody enter a program of risk assessment including glucose tolerance testing.  Once subjects are identified as being at risk for the development of diabetes, they are evaluated every 6 months to assess their autoantibody and metabolic status.  Close monitoring provides the benefit of rapid disease identification and avoidance of severe diabetes-onset related symptoms (such as ketoacidosis), and in addition, TrialNet has recently launched a pilot prevention trial for a group of at-risk subjects identified through the Natural History study.  Current plans call for screening of 20,000 individuals per year through 2011. In the event that funding is not available, the Natural History study will be terminated early and the pilot will not progress to the full trial.

Two of the TrialNet clinical research studies currently in progress involve immunumodulatory therapy in individuals with new-onset T1D.  The first of these studies, involving treatment with Mycophenolate Mofetil and Daclizumab (MMF/DZB), completed enrollment of the 120 planned subjects in November 2006.  This study includes follow-up of subjects through 2010. The second active new-onset study employing immunomodulatory therapy involves Anti-CD20 (Rituximab). To date, this study has enrolled 16 of the total 66 patients planned, and plans to follow subjects through 2009-2010.

Another TrialNet protocol underway is the T Cell Validation Study.  This mechanistic study was designed to validate four different T cell assays for reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity in detecting autoimmune responses in diabetics versus controls.  T cell measurements are expected to provide important information relating to interventions in TrialNet??s clinical trials. This study is expected to complete recruitment in the North American sites by the end of February 2007, and 3 months later in the United Kingdom.  It will involve approximately 200 subjects at all sites combined.  Another round of assay testing is expected to launch prior to the end of the first quarter 2007, and to be completed by mid 2008.

TrialNet has recently launched the Nutritional Intervention to Prevent Type 1 Diabetes Pilot Trial (NIP).  In this trial, 90 newborn infants possessing a first degree relative with T1D and no diabetes-protective HLA alleles will be randomized to receive supplemental omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (DHA) through either maternal (breast milk) or formula supplementation.  The trial is a pilot aiming to accrue all 90 subjects within one year and then follow them over 2 years. DHA will be measured in blood to determine whether the target value of 20% higher DHA is achieved in the treated compared to control group.  In addition, a 20% lower level of an inflammatory cytokine, IL1-beta, in the treated population is a primary objective of the pilot trial.  The pilot trial is expected to be completed by the end of 2009.  

The Oral Insulin Trial pilot was launched in January 2007.  This trial will test a hypothesis suggested by post hoc analysis of the earlier NIDDK-sponsored Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1).  That trial suggested that individuals with high levels of insulin autoantibodies in their blood, as well as other characteristics resulting in a 25-50% chance of getting T1D over the subsequent 5 years, could delay or prevent the onset of diabetes by taking insulin by mouth.  TrialNet will confirm or refute the hypothesis by recruiting subjects with similar characteristics into a trial involving daily insulin or placebo ingestion over approximately 5-8 years.  The trial is expected to recruit approximately 300 subjects through 2011 and follow them through 2018. In the event that funding is not available, the trial will halt recruiting and subjects will be followed as funding permits, if scientifically warranted.
Two additional TrialNet-led intervention trials are approved and under development, Anti-CD3+Exenatide and Metabolic Control. The Anti-CD3+Exenatide trial will be a randomized controlled open label trial.  Recently-diagnosed type 1 diabetics will be treated with a GLP-1 agonist, Exenatide, which is expected to promote insulin responsiveness and to help maintain residual ??-cell activity, and Anti-CD3 which has been previously determined to delay the decline in C-peptide production in newly-diagnosed T1D patients.  After safety review of the combination of drugs in 30 patients, the plan is to extend the treatment to 130 additional subjects. In addition, a 4-arm trial is being planned for subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, not yet clinically diabetic, but with an 80% risk of developing frank diabetes over the subsequent 5 years.  For new onset trials the primary endpoints are C-peptide production at 1 or 2 years, while the prevention trial will use diabetes onset as the primary endpoint.  The new-onset trial is expected to be completed in 2010, while the prevention trial is expected to be finished in 2012.  In the event that funding is not available, the prevention trial will not be initiated. 

The newly approved Metabolic Control trial aims to provide very intensive metabolic control to subjects within a few days of T1D onset.  The plan is to use a system of continuous glucose monitoring and closed-loop insulin delivery in the hospital, followed by intense monitoring and insulin pump at home.  The patients will be randomized to either very intense or standard-of-care treatment and followed for C peptide production at 1 and 2 years post diagnosis, and should be completed in 2010.   

The contract is for a ten-year period, unless funding is not available, in which case the contract will be for a 4 to 5 year period.  As can be readily appreciated by the above descriptions, the TrialNet consortium has embarked upon a series of complex and challenging studies and trials, aimed at taking full advantage of the current opportunities for diabetes intervention, and to offer reasonable therapeutic options to recently diagnosed and at risk populations.  In each case, statistical methods and trial design have emphasized maximizing efficiency and minimizing trial duration by, for example, using maximum information design whenever possible.  In addition, by investing in infrastructure for recruiting, TrialNet expects to maximize efficiency and to capture all patient populations for which trial opportunities exist.  Finally, by investing in studies to optimize diabetes risk assessment, and to optimize clinical tests and validate mechanistic assays, TrialNet hopes to produce accurate and reliable information to allow optimization of the information to be extracted from each clinical trial and subject.  These activities are expected to provide the basis for treatments that can significantly delay or stop the decline of ??-cell function in subjects at risk for or recently diagnosed with T1D.

Current plans are to continue to launch a limited number of approved new trials though 2008.  Additional approved new trials will be launched only if sufficient funds are available.  Thereafter, if funding resources do not continue, TrialNet and the TNCC will adjust operations for completion of active trials launched by 2008, but will cease the initiation of new trials or the transition from pilot trials to full trials.  If funding continues, TrialNet will continue to solicit, review, develop, and execute new trials, and the TNCC operation will be maintained to accommodate those needs. It is expected that new trials will replace old ones and the TrialNet consortium will operate as projected herein.

Project Overview:

Work to be performed under this contract may include design, development and launch of approved studies as well as execution of protocols including screening, recruitment, intervention, and follow-up according to schedules and procedures contained in the studies?? Manuals of Operations.  The TNCC shall receive, manage, and analyze data obtained from the Clinical Centers. Clinical Centers and Core Laboratories will be responsible for reporting data on standardized study forms supplied by the TNCC. Data forms will be forwarded directly from the clinics to the TNCC, which shall edit and enter data into the master database. All data shall be stored, maintained, and analyzed at the TNCC. In addition, the TNCC shall prepare reports of the results of these assessments for transmittal in a standardized format. 

The TNCC shall have a key role in the operational conduct of TrialNet and in data analysis in accordance with policies set forth by TrialNet for each study protocol.

Below is an overview of the subcontracts to the TNCC:  

TrialNet Coordinating Center Subcontracts

Clinical Centers ?V There are 17 TrialNet Clinical Centers located in North America, Europe, and Australia.  These Centers receive infrastructure support as well as per-patient capitated reimbursements.  All of the Clinical Centers enroll patients into multiple TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until all protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Clinical Center Subcontractors ?V Several of the Clinical Centers have subcontractors working with them on TrialNet projects.  They are subcontractors because they are located at sites that are distinct from (but generally close to) the parent Clinical Center.  The subcontractors that enroll patients into TrialNet clinical research studies will need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until all protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Major Affiliate Centers ?V There are 17 TrialNet Major Affiliate Centers located in North America.  These Centers receive infrastructure support as well as per-patient capitated reimbursements.  All of the Major Affiliates enroll patients into one or more TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until the pertinent TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Affiliate Centers ?V There are currently 178 TrialNet Affiliate Centers located in North America.  These Centers receive per-patient capitated reimbursements.  Almost all of the Affiliate Centers enroll patients into one or more TrialNet clinical research studies and will thus need to continue to follow their TrialNet study patients until the pertinent TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Core Laboratories ?V There are 5 TrialNet Core Laboratories located in North America.  These Core Laboratories receive infrastructure support to perform as central laboratories for all of the TrialNet studies.  It is crucial that the TrialNet Core Laboratories remain unchanged so that the intra- and inter-study laboratory data remains optimally comparable and reliable.  The Core Laboratories will need to continue to analyze TrialNet samples generated by TrialNet clinical research studies until the TrialNet protocols have been completed.  Protocol duration varies from 2 to 8 years.

Laboratories ?V There are 7 TrialNet Laboratories located in North America and Europe.  These laboratories perform studies specific to one or more TrialNet studies.  These laboratories will need to remain constant until the studies they are involved with are completed to ensure optimization of intra- and inter-study data.  

Medical Monitor ?V The TrialNet Medical Monitor oversees the adverse event process related to all TrialNet studies.  This includes planning for tracking and evaluating adverse events, processing adverse event reports, and reporting adverse events to the appropriate parties, including the DSMB, IRBs, and appropriate regulatory agencies.  

Central Pharmacy and Supplies ?V The TrialNet Central Pharmacy handles all aspects of receipt, processing, and distribution of TrialNet study drug supplies.  For some studies, this includes production of drug and placebo.  This group also handles distribution of various medical supplies to the TrialNet sites.

Consultants ?V TrialNet utilizes consultants to assist with various TrialNet functions.  These consultants advise TrialNet on psychosocial and infectious disease issues related to the conduct of TrialNet trials.
A detailed listing of the 230+ clinical centers, affiliate centers, laboratories, central pharmacy, medical monitor, and consultants will be provided upon the release of the Request for Proposal.

<DESC>Purpose of Request for Information (RFI): United Space Alliance (USA), LLC, through its offices located in Cape Canaveral, Florida is seeking sources capable of providing the requirement described herein.  This acquisition is in support of USAs prime contract NNJ06VA01C  Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC) with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Technical Requirements Description: USA is seeking potential sources to design, fabricate, assemble and test two Liquid Oxygen Vaporizer Systems for the Launch Complex 39 A and B.  The new LOX vaporizer system replaces existing water to LOX vaporizers, which are approximately forty years old.  The new vaporizer system shall be installed at ground level and shall use air to provide the latent heat for vaporization. Each LOX vaporizer system will receive LOX from 900,000-gallon storage spheres, vaporize the LOX, and return Gaseous Oxygen (GO2) to the ullage space of the LOX storage sphere at increased pressure.  The pressure is required to provide adequate Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) to LOX pumps supplied from the LOX storage sphere. The replacement vaporizers will be located approximately 3,000 feet from the Atlantic Ocean and will be subjected to continuous salt spray.  Additionally the vaporizers will be subjected to deposition of the combustion products of solid rocket motors that are also high in chlorides. Adherence and compliance to multiple Kennedy Space Center (KSC), NASA, military, and industry standards will be required.  Each system shall consist of no less than two or no more than six vaporizer modules, one of which shall be operationally held on standby to provide redundancy for the remaining modules.  The redundant module shall not be considered in the capacity calculations.  Vendor shall be responsible for sizing of the modules and the selection of the exact number needed.	The vaporizer supporting aluminum structure shall be designed to meet the requirements of the Aluminum Design Manual of the Aluminum Association; and to sustain 130MPH hurricane wind speed, important factor l = 1.15, exposure C category as defined in SEI/ASCE 7-05. Vendor shall prepare a quality assurance plan for approval of USA Quality Assurance including procedures to ensure compliance with contract drawings and specifications.  Vendor shall perform the following tests on the module and provide acceptance test reports to USAs Quality Assurance department: Cold Shock, Pneumostatic Test, Leak Test, and will provide the modules cleaned to the appropriate KSC specification.

In accordance with FAR10.001, the government is conducting market research to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 

The Government will use the information gathered in response to this document to refine acquisition strategy for integrated service solutions. 

The government has approximately 120 Dispense source point-of-use industrial plant equipment in place today and is planning to have an estimated number of 400 when installation is complete. The equipment will be located in 40+ buildings. 

The MRO materials to be stocked include but are not limited to consumables, expendables and personal protection equipment items at each location.  The Government plans to have one provider for all locations and applications. The services to be provide include (1) Manage Dispense Source point-of-use applications (equipment) at specified buildings and locations; (2) Purchase, Deliver, Stock and Replenish all MRO materials and inventory within point-of-use applications, (equipment); (3) Maintain, Cycle Count and Manage all inventory with point-of-use applications (equipment) and virtual cribs. (4) Process, expedite, and follow-up on spot buys and purchases, and; (5) Provide inventory and category management services. 

 For informational purposes only the Government is requesting answers to the following questions:

1. Does your company perform Inventory Management as described above for commercial Industry? Please provide a brief description of the scope of that effort. Can you provide copies of these contracts or Point of Contacts to obtain additional information?

2. Do you provide this or a similar service to a government entity? Which government entity and what are the contract numbers or Point of Contacts?

3. What type of a contract (Firm fixed price, Cost plus fixed fee, Time and Materials etc) would provide the Government the best service and work best for your company to supply this integrated service?

4. If we have a requirement for one-time spot buys for existing Industrial Production Equipment do you have experience with performing this type of service or buy? What type of CLIN structure would you use for this type of requirement?

5. Have you been involved with or used an automated point-of-use system? If yes, please describe the extent and details of that experience.

6. It is unclear what the full scope of an Inventory Product Service requirement will look like at 76MXW over the next year. However, the Government has a partial perspective of what is currently in place. How would you plan for fluctuations in the requirement workload (with only partial history)for a procurement of this nature?

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
HUMAN SYSTEMS INTEGRATION (HSI)
ASSESSMENTS IN AIR FORCE SYSTEMS

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry.  Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement of payment by the government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  
 
INTRODUCTION: The Air Force, PKAC, Brooks City-Base, TX, is planning for a Research & Development contract to provide services support in areas of Human Systems Integration (HSI) expertise to accomplish several efforts on defense acquisition and sustainment programs.  This RFI is issued to determine the capability of prospective contractors to provide comprehensive HSI services.  These services include expertise in the HSI domain areas of: Manpower, Personnel, Training, Environment, Safety, Occupational Health, Human Factors Engineering, Habitability, and Survivability, as well as finance, human performance, instructional development, logistics, marketing, human resource development, data mining, concept mapping, metrics, and systems engineering.

BACKGROUND:  The Air Force requires a sound HSI strategy in acquisition programs as a highly effective method of saving the Air Force significant costs during the life cycle of systems and improving total system performance.  A sound HSI strategy puts the warfighter at the center of the design process and equips the warfighter rather than manning the equipment.  Early application of HSI leads to cost avoidance in terms of manpower, personnel, training, and human error.  To achieve this requirement, the Air Force seeks business and industry familiar with DoD and/or commercial systems and application of HSI on those systems. 

SCOPE:  This request for information is directed to highly competitive potential prime contractors who can demonstrate the capability to provide HSI knowledge and experience and understand how the application of HSI benefits the acquisition process and affects total life cycle costs in the design, development, integration, and fielding of programs.  The Government recognizes that HSI practitioners are limited and therefore at this point in the market research process, the Government would like to continue dialog with those Industry partners who feel they could be a viable prime contractor.

The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine the requirements and acquisition strategy for the following tasks:

Generate HSI concept maps that will validate an existing HSI Assessment Tool model that will be used to assess HSI & Human Performance methods and processes for all systems regardless of acquisition phase.

Research and draft policies to include: HSI process into Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS); HSI-related Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs) into capability documents; and feasibility study for implementing a blanket HSI KPP or mandating key HSI-relevant KPP/KSAs based on human performance concerns.

Identify HSI drivers associated with existing Air Force operational metrics.  

Transform the existing Air Force Process Sequence Models (PSMs) into Integrated Manpower and Personnel Integration (IMPRINT) models for the purpose of conducting HSI capability based assessments.

Provide HSI Community of Practice (an informational repository .mil restricted) support and data mining.  

Conduct research, identify key internal and external partnership opportunities, and draft memorandum of agreements and/or understanding with strategic agencies into an existing HSI Collaborations database.

Research and define an HSI Instructional Design Strategy (front-end analysis) that focuses on HSI Practitioner career development and HSI training needs throughout the Air Force.

Research, develop, and reverse engineer, if required, HSI costing methodologies on existing system acquisition programs.  Contractors collectively must have program management and HSI experience and access to SECRET information.

Develop an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) HSI-relevant project transition roadmap.

Develop a professional tradeshow to include a HSI promotional and marketing strategy, communication plan, and conference display booth that supports multiple target audience messages and visitor survey capability.

<DESC>Personal Cooling System RFI Draft Product Manager- Soldier Survivability (PM-SSV) is seeking information regarding the availability of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) Personal Cooling Systems (PCS).  This notice constitutes a Request for Information only , THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, no award will be made for this effort at this time.  BACKGROUND: PM-SSV is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of COTS, modified commercial products or GOTS that can provide a level of protection for Soldiers against heat injuries/dangers due to exposure to extreme heat environments/cond itions.  After review and evaluation of industry's submissions, samples of the most promising candidates may be procured for the Soldier Protection Demonstration (field testing) to evaluate the efficacy of the products and determine suitability for Army us e.  DESCRIPTION: The Army seeks PCS that meet the requirements outlined. PCS requirements are expressed as Threshold (i.e. minimum) and Objective (i.e. desired) requirements, where applicable.  If a parameter has only one value, it is the threshold requirement .  PCSs will be used with clothing and individual equipment (CIE), and/or Interceptor Body Armor (IBA) worn and carried by Soldiers, excluding chemical protective clothing and equipment. (1)  Weight.  8 pounds (Threshold-T); 5 pounds (Objective - O).  Weight includes the cooling system, power source (if applicable), and cooling garment. (2)  Cooling.  120 watts (T), 180 watts (O) average heat removal at a 95°F ambient environment, as measured in accordance with F2371-05 Standard Test Method for Measuring the Heat Removal Rate of Personal Cooling Systems Using a Sweating Heated Manikin. (3)  Duration.  2 hours (T); 4 hours (O).  Duration is defined as the point at which the net cooling level provided by the PCS drops to less than 50 watts, as measured in accordance with the test method cited in 2.2 above. (4)  Size.  150 in3 (T); 120 in3 (O).  This includes the cooling unit and power source, but not the cooling garment.  The thickness of the cooling garment must not exceed 0.375 inch (T); 0.25 inch (O). (5)  Logistics.  Logistics shall consist of the replacement of the power source (e.g. batteries), dust filters, etc.  Systems requiring water, refrigerators/freezers and/or air conditioned spaces to recharge or replenish the cooling medium cannot be suppor ted and, therefore, products requiring this logistics tail will not be considered. (6) Orientation.  The PCS must operate at its threshold performance level at orientation changes of up to 15 degrees from vertical (T); orientation insensitive (O).   (7)  Compatibility with CIE or IBA. a.  No specification shall be made to legacy CIE to facilitate integration of the PCS. b.  The integration of the PCS shall not require the resizing of legacy CIE or IBA. c.  The PCS must include all hardware to mount it securely on the body.  It shall not interfere with other items typically carried/worn by Soldiers (e.g., helmet, body armor). d.  Wearing the PCS shall not compromise the protection provided by legacy CIE. e.  The PCS shall not require a tether to an auxiliary device (e.g. power generator) during operation and dismount operation. (8)  Power.  If needed, the PCS power source must operate on standard military or commonly available COTS batteries (T); standard military and commonly available COTS batteries (O).  (9)  Operations. a.  Controls.  The PCS shall have provisions to allow users to turn the system on or off (T); high, low, off or skin temperature feedback (O). b.  The PCS controls must be easily accessible and distinguishable when operated with a gloved hand and in low light, but have sufficient safeguards to avoid inadvertent activation during execution of Individual Movement Techniques (IMTs). c.  The PCS shall be capable of being donned/doffed without assistance.  The PCS must have a quick release mechanism that all ows the user to doff the system in less than 30 seconds, without compromising the protection provided by the CIE. (10)  Environmental.  The PCS will be evaluated in a simulated operational environment; therefore, it must be capable of withstanding associated environmental insults such as sand/dust, rain, vibration, and mechanical shock. (11)  Support Equipment.  PCS support equipment must be minimized.  Any support equipment must be provided with the PCS. (12)  Tools.  The PCS shall not introduce/require any special tools to operate or maintain the system. (13)  Reliability.  The PCS must be capable of operating for 200 hours (T), 500 hours (O) before system failure (note: periodic maintenance, described in 2.14 may be performed). (14)  Safety/Health Hazards. a.  Health hazards associated with the PCS will be eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels. b.  The PCS will be constructed of materials that are non-toxic when in contact with the skin and open wounds.  If components are burned, fumes will be no more toxic than legacy electronic or CIE currently worn/carried/used by Soldiers, if inhaled.  The PC S will neither contain nor produce hazardous waste more than legacy electronic or clothing equipment of similar construction. c.  The PCS design must not present a safety hazard to personnel; sharp edges or corners must be eliminated and sufficient safeguards on moving parts must be included to prevent bodily injury or damage to other CIE. d.  During operation, the PCS shall not present a contact burn hazard to users. (15)  Maintenance.  There shall be no maintenance required of the PCS during its operation.  Maintenance should be restricted to pre/post-operation system checkout. At this time, PM-SSV is seeking sources, technical and product information for PCS.

<SUBJECT>B--MMS Resource Evaluation Modeling--Technical Support
<DESC>The U.S. Dept. of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement.  The purpose of this notice is to announce the MMS' intent to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Mr. Barry Dickerson, Manassas, VA.  This purchase order will be awarded in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  MMS anticipates awarding the purchase order to Mr. Dickerson for MMS' Resource Evaluation Modeling Technical Support requirement as detailed below.  The purchase order will be for a base period of seven months, with three 6-month option periods.  MMS has mission critical needs that must be met by a contractor with the requisite knowledge, skills and abilities to work with MONTCAR, GRASP II, and the OCS Methane Gas Hydrates models.  It is anticipated that MMS shall use Mr. Dickerson's expertise in the use of these models to assist in developing MMS programs and policies, and performing resource assessment and evaluations of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas prospects.  MMS currently uses the MONTCAR tract evaluation model, a proprietary stochastic discounted cash flow simulator to develop the principal input to the Government's estimate of the fair market value on which the Bureau's bid acceptance/rejection decisions are based.  MONTCAR has a number of advanced features and capabilities that meet the specific needs of the Government in its role as the lessor of the mineral rights.  MMS also uses the GRASP II computer model, a probabilistic resource assessment program, that assesses potential hydrocarbon resources in the OCS.  GRASP II is not proprietary; however, it does contain extensive modules developed in-house by MMS that perform the economic analyses for the resource assessments.  The MONTCAR and GRASP II models must continue to be maintained and enhanced and timely user support is critical to address ongoing evaluation needs and issues.  Mr. Dickerson will also act as the Subject Matter Expert for all aspects of the evaluation and assessment of offshore oil and gas prospects and U.S. leasing history and policies.  This notice is not a formal solicitation.  This is NOT a request for an IT solution, nor is it considered a Request for Quotation; nor is it considered a Request for Proposal.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  This notice of intent is for informational purposes only.  No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offer received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase order will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received by the Point of Contact listed below by close of business June 1, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  POC: Debra Bridge, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA  20170.

The vessel must be outfitted with a U.S. Coast Guard approved type II sewage treatment plant for blackwater (sewage).  


The purpose of this procurement is to assess the effectiveness of the establishment of marine protected areas.  The Tortugas Ecological Reserve South was established as part of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in order to protect the unique habitat utilized by mutton snapper as an aggregating locale for spawning and to afford protection to the population of mutton snapper.  The most reliable way to monitor fish populations is to go on-site and conduct visual census operations using SCUBA gear.  A one week long cruise is necessary to obtain the research.  M/V Spree is the only reliable vessel known which can assist in the research.  This vessel has a live aboard dive platform that has the capacity to carry as many as 24 divers.  The vessel is a dive live-aboard with water making capability to allow for extended at sea operational time.  It can accommodate all 24 divers, and has nitrox dive compressors onboard for continual refills of dive cylinders.  This will allow for no interruption of research gathering.  The research plan for this cruise requires a large amount of camera work underwater, and requires working bench space inside, a dry area for camera battery charging and laptop computer operations.  The M/V Spree has the inside working area, catering to the underwater photographer.  The operator of the M/V Spree has a unique working knowledge of the research area.  The M/V Spree has the ability to support technical diving operations up to 240 ft.  Researchers will perform dives in excess of the recreational dive limit of 130ft., down to approximately to 150 ft. This vessel has a current working permit which allows scientific research in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. There is no other known vessel capable of allowing the researchers to dive to these depths.  The M/V Spree is the only vessel known which is outfitted with a U.S. Coast Guard approved type II sewage treatment plant for blackwater (sewage) which is required for working in ecological reserves.  

The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agencies requirement based on the information above.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 7 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  To be eligible for award the offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  For information regarding registering in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov.

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), J3 Plans room located at Building 861, MacDill AFB, FL 33621, requires openly processing and storing classified information.  Currently, JCSE J3 Plans room is not in compliance with the standards outlined in DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, Appendix G (6 SFS Survey by Christine Tighe and SSgt Henderson).  It is critical that the JCSE purchase an approved Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as soon as possible to insure the protection of classified information.  Improperly protecting classified information could seriously endanger operations and should be avoided at all costs.  The IDS equipment installed and monitored (alarm system) in all facilities on MacDill AFB are Advantage Suite for Networks (ASN) by Advantor Systems Corporation.  Advantor products are proprietary and not available from any other source.  To bring another contractor on board, assuming the contractor has an approved IDS system would require the 6th Security Forces to monitor two (2) base wide alarm systems versus one (1).  The only other option would be to purchase an entire Intrusion Detection System for MacDill AFB, which is currently valued over $250K.  Pursuing another IDS for MacDill would not be cost effective nor would it be reasonable when an additional Advantor IDS can be purchased for $4K.

<SUBJECT>B -- Use of HIgh Spectral Resolution Lidar for Data
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the Arctic Research Group of the Physical Sciences Division (PSD) of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Wisconsin located at 1225 W. Dayton St., Madison, WI, 53706 for the use of their High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) for data collection for operations at a high Arctic observation site in Eureka, Canada.  

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received in response to this notice will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who believe they can meet the agency?s requirements are requested to submit, in writing, an affirmative response demonstrating their technical capabilities.  To be considered an affirmative response, the response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the stated requirements.  Interested parties must address each of the mandatory requirements listed in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet requirements.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the agency proceeding as stated above.  All affirmative responses shall be received by 4:00 P.M., Mountain Standard Time, on June 18, 2007 to Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov.

BACKGROUND:     NOAA operates a major climate research site in the high Arctic as part of NOAA?s Study for Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) program. NOAA is one of eight federal agencies participating in the implementation of SEARCH. With a mission to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet the Nation's economic, social and environmental needs, NOAA has a particularly important role to play in SEARCH.  The SEARCH facility in Eureka, Canada currently has a University of Wisconsin (UW) owned HSRL operating at its site.  The UW has provided NOAA with the analysis of the HSRL data since August of 2005.  This new acquisition effort requires the UW to continue to house their lidar in Eureka, Canada and provide the same data and analysis to NOAA over a five year period. These measurements include all backscatter cross section, optical depth and depolarization data collected by the lidar.  

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a base period of one year, followed by four 1-year option periods.

SOLE SOURCE: NOAA has determined that the UW is the only contractor that can satisfy its requirements.   Only UW can provide the lidar to collect the data required by NOAA.  Besides being able to meet the other requirements listed below, UW has the only lidar that is known to be able to take unattended lidar measurements 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week.  In addition, UW has the ability to retrieve cloud micro-physical properties from the HSRL data and correlate these data with three other instruments currently operating in Eureka: a millimeter cloud radar, a microwave radiometer, and a polar atmospheric emitted radiation interferometer.  Dr. Ed Eloranta , one of the world?s leading experts on high spectral resolution lidars, currently leads UW?s Lidar Group. Dr. Eloranta and his team developed their lidar through National Science Foundation (NSF) funding and have proven its unique ability to monitor cloud properties in the Arctic.  

UW's Unique Qualifications:

?	The HSRL is capable of unattended lidar measurements 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.    

Unattended operation is critical in order obtain a continuous data record from the lidar for use in climate studies. There is only one person located at this site that is in charge of monitoring a large number of instruments and can not be expected to watch over any single instrument more than the rest. This instrument will be operating at a high Arctic site where weather conditions may restrict the on-site personnel from being able to check on the instruments for extended periods of time. 

?	Availability of lidar for a minimum of 5 years 

?	The HSRL is able to measure a separate molecular scattering profile along with the standard lidar profile. This provides an absolute calibration and eliminates the need to make assumptions about the nature of the scattering media.

?	The High Spectral Resolution Lidar is capable of automated data processing using the measured direct reference molecular scattering.

?	The transmitter and receiver shares the same 0.4 m diameter telescope maintaining alignment of the laser beam with the receiver field of view to perturbations at the 10 rad level

?	Laser power (minimum level: 200mW outgoing power).

?	Total stability of the laser light frequency has to be better then ?100MHz.

?	Asynchronous Data Push detectors.  

?	Field-of-view better than 50 ?rad.

?	Twice a day automatic self-calibrated receiver channels.

?	Lidar must fit in instrument container currently installed in Eureka, Canada
(~8?x4? space). 

?	Lidar specifications:
Wavelength------------------------ 532 nm (locked to line 1109 of iodine) 
Laser pulse width----------------- 40 ns
Repetition rate--------------------- 4 kHz
Receiver spectral bandpass---------- 6 GHz (pressure tuned etalon) 
Aerosol blocking filter bandwidth-- 1.8 GHz (line 1109 of iodine spectrum) 
Data acquisition---------------------- Photon counting
Altitude resolution------------------ 7.5 m, (i.e.50 nsec bin width)
Typical time resolution-------------- 2.5 s (programmable)

<SUBJECT>A -- VULTURE Program
<DESC>The VULTURE Air Vehicle Program is an exploratory development program with the overall goal to develop and demonstrate the ability to deliver and maintain an airborne payload on station for an uninterrupted period exceeding 5 years using a heavier-than-air platform system.  It is envisioned that this program will, at a minimum, develop and demonstrate advanced reliability technologies for air vehicles.  Other advanced technologies may also be developed and demonstrated depending upon the nature of the architectures proposed by Offerors. The Government is not interested in approaches that use either radioactive energy sources or employs any form of buoyant flight for this application. 

The VULTURE Air Vehicle Program will research and develop technologies and systems which will enable the Military to deliver and maintain a 1000 lb, 5 kW airborne payload for an uninterrupted period exceeding 5 years with a 99+% on station probability.  The architectures selected and the specific approaches taken by the Offerors will determine the range of technical areas that are developed, including, but not limited to, environmental energy collection, high specific energy storage, extremely efficient propulsion systems, precision robotic refueling, autonomous materiel transfer, extremely efficient vehicle structural design, and mitigation of environmentally-induced loads.

The key technology development objectives include: 1) identification of robust system architectures that meet the program goals; 2) identification of efficient systems that allow the program vision to be achieved; and 3) identification and reduction of both major and minor system and subsystem technology risks.

It is anticipated the program will be divided into three phases: 1) conceptual system definition with a supporting formal reliability and mission success analysis, exiting with a System Readiness Review and an option for continuation task; 2) risk reduction development and testing phase to include a Preliminary and Critical Design of a prototype ending with the flight test of a scaled version of the system; and 3) fabrication, assembly and flight test evaluation encompassing an operational demonstration using the design payload.

The initial dissemination of information on this initiative will be the VULTURE Program Industry Day on June 7, 2007.  The goals of this meeting are threefold: 1) to familiarize participants with DARPA's interest in Long Endurance Aircraft technology, 2) to identify potential Offerors and promote understanding of the BAA proposal requirements, and 3) to promote discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.  It is our desire to facilitate the formation of strong teams and business relationships in order to develop comprehensive, quality responses to any potential DARPA solicitation.

The Industry Day will be held Thursday, June 7, 2007, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm at The Westin Arlington Gateway, Fitzgerald Ballroom (2nd Floor), 801 N. Glebe Road Arlington, VA US 22203 (http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1513).  

Pre-registration is required NO LATER THAN 3:00 PM EDST on May 31, 2007 for attendance.  The Industry Day will be unclassified and is limited to three representatives per organization. Attendance is not required to propose to any potential solicitation on this topic.   Check-in for the Industry Day begins at 8:00 AM, followed by the morning session beginning at 8:30 AM.  This session will include the introduction of the DARPA VULTURE Program vision and philosophy, objectives and goals, and invited presentations addressing state-of-the-art foundation technologies. After lunch, the afternoon session will cover acquisition and program schedules, and contract vehicle details.

<SUBJECT>--Modification to Extend Ordering Period for Current Medical Repair/Renewal contracts DACA87-03-D-0008, DACA87-03-D-0009, DACA87-03-D-0010, and DACA87-03-D-0011.
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts which will extend each contracts orde ring period consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The total programmatic capacity established at time of award of the current contracts was established at $500 million over a total possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) b ase year and four (4) one-year option periods).  No increase to the contracts capacity is required.  The MRR program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against four (4) ID/IQ cont racts in order to provide quick response for medical facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement / installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and  facilities.  All current contract awards were made in fiscal year 2003 under full and open competition procedures.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in the next 9 months.  As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and co nducting pre-award functions for the follow-on MRR acquisitions, under NAICS code 236220.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions are anticipated to be released by Summer 2007 and the awards made in Spring 2008.  Due to the lapse in coverage, i t is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current MRR ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by six (6) months with an additional six (6) month option period.  Once the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.  The Government will not exercise the additional six (6) month option should the follow-on acqui sitions be awarded prior to the period in which the additional six (6) month option would be exercised.  The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-03-D -0008 (John J. Kirlin), DACA87-03-D-0009 (BMAR and Associates), DACA87-03-D-0010 (J&J Maintenance), and DACA87-03-D-0011 (Global Engineering).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.  The Government intends  to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services w ill satisfy.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior MRR experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring nee d for medical facility repairs and renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  The Government wi ll synopsize the contract modifications after award.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements receive d within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability St atements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The statement shall include pricing informat ion which includes profit rate, overhead rate, G&A rate, project management and support personnel rates; business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting and associated mark-ups; and any other information indicating a legitimate abilit y to meet these specific requirements.  Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length.  Statements and/or written inquiries may be directed to Ms. Cassandra Mora via email at Cassandra.D.Mora@hnd01.usace.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Combined synopsis/solicitation 070005 questions and answers: 1.	What training locations are being considered? Is this training in Montana? Does the vendor need to include costs for travel and per diem? West Yellowstone, MT - RRC will transport from Bozeman to West Yellowstone.   Cost should include - travel - per diem  2.	How should the proposal be priced? Is a 2-day session price sufficient or is a cost breakdown analysis required?  Two Day cumulative cost 3.	Will the vendor have access to the list of trainees prior to session? If so how far in advance will the list be available and can pre-work be given? Yes, upon request  4.	Can you provide additional clarification of the phrasing Ways to effectively combat the WAR drawbacks?  Does this mean how the war has affected recruitment numbers and strategies? Stream lined, PROVEN sales approach - that counters the negative affects of serving - when multiple deployments are a reality.    5.	Does client have access to video teleconferencing equipment and preferred provider in place already? September training obviously hands on - follow-up semi-annual is preferred to be VTC - rather than simply telephone conferencing.  6.	Is the video teleconference a group assessment or a one-on-one with each individual trainee? If it is a group assessment how much time do you anticipate should be scheduled for each of the 2 days?  Group assessment - lessons learned since training, best practices (What Worked) what isn't working?  1 hour each 7.	Does day one consist of only 10-12 trainees (high-level personnel)? Then does Day 2 about 50 personnel (of varying levels)? How many trainees will be present each day? My questions are posed because of these two sections from the RFP : Day 1 Supervisory Personnel  SFC x 2  Recruiting Training Battalion - NCOIC  /  RRC Opns SGT MSG x 4  NCOIC of the Sales Team SGM x 2  Task Force Sergeant's Major - Sales Force MAJ x 1 Commander CPT x 2 Executive Officer / Officer Strength Manager Above and 45 Front Line Recruiters 8.	Has this training been conducted in the past?          Yes, we have had trainers come and instruct before two years ago now, but are looking to sustain that training and take this to the next level in current environment.   9.	Is this the first time the training is being ordered?        Yes, it is from this state at this level. 10.	Are you seeking more motivational speaking or more hands-on training?       The training I am seeking develops and employs proven validated systems that increase to already proven success.  While the training maybe motivational - the intent is to increase sales. 11.	What has prompted the training?      New Commander that wants to take this professional sales force to higher levels through self-proven sales practices - while providing a platform to work smarter not harder.  12.	The training is only for September 26 & 27?    Yes, it is two days (on site) with two scheduled (TBD) video teleconferencing or call-in's.   13.	What is the price format for proposals? A lump sum price for the entire training is acceptable in the proposal.  It need not be broken out by task. 14.	What is the size limit or format of the proposal? There is no size limit or specific format.  Please ensure that proposal includes enough information to make a proper assessment of your companys capabilities and proposed training.

				STATEMENT OF WORK
Purpose
In September 2006, FRA offered on-line ethics training to satisfy basic training requirements for all of its employees with a reminder that everyone is expected to follow the ethics rules.  While the on-line training is useful, it cannot provide the depth of understanding required to develop and reinforce a strong ethical foundation.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Inspector General (OIG), in its Top Management Challenges for 2007 stated, DOT needs to continually promote and reinforce ethical standard through rigorous ethics awareness and training programs.

Objective
The objective of this procurement is to obtain on-site training at a minimum of five conferences planned between June 2007 and September 2007.  Each of the Office of Safetys technical disciplines is holding a conference designed around training and improving communications.  The conferences are already scheduled and our field personnel are planning to attend, the conferences are ideal venues to provide the in-depth ethics training directed by the OIG.

Task Statement
Training should address the rules of ethical conduct that all employees should know and follow.  All training sessions, with the exception of the final session in Washington, DC, will be conducted on site in Fort Worth, Texas.  This training should provide a sound foundation for an ethical workplace including identifying:

	Ethical responsibilities in the workplace
	Personal character and integrity
	Truth and lies
	Respect
	Ethical decision-making
	A fair and equitable workplace
	A healthy, safe, drug-free workplace
	Electronic communications
	Conflicts of interest
	Conflicts of time and resources
	Understanding gifts and hospitality
	Using government property and time
	Enforcing and reinforcing standards

It is expected that each training session will be for one full day.

<SOLNBR>F4D3D37115AG01

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the following item:

The contractor shall provide all labor, tools, parts, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation and supervision necessary to capture, cultivate, and provide genetic testing for a butterfly found on Vandenberg AFB (VAFB).  The species found on VAFB was identified as Euphilotes battoides near allyni.  Euphilotes battoides allyni is the El Segundo Blue butterfly (ESBB), which is federally listed.  Previously, the ESBB was only found in four locations in the Los Angeles area.  Additionally, it was only thought to inhabit coastal sand dunes.  It is a biological anomaly that VAFB would have the ESBB given previous data.  Individuals of the Euphilotes complex are very difficult to identify based upon phenotypic traits.  Additionally, there is substantial variance within the Euphilotes battoides complex. Genetic testing is necessary in order to determine the species of butterfly we have and the appropriate protection measures that are required by law.

Scope of Work:  

1.	Contractor shall complete field surveys for the El Segundo Blue Butterfly (ESBB) and its habitat during the flight period, which is June through August.
2.	Contactor shall provide input and support services with other members of the VAFB ESBB Action Team to accomplish tasks such as survey design, sharing results and discussing findings and conclusions. 
3.	All areas occupied by the ESBB and areas surveyed will be mapped using a GPS unit, and GIS shapefiles will be submitted to CEVNN upon completion of the surveys. Data collected must be accurate to within 10 meters.
4.	Surveyors must be willing to add qualified individuals to their permits as ?supervised individuals? while surveying on Vandenberg.  ?Supervised individuals? may help surveyors record location data (GPS), however, it is ultimately the permit holder?s responsibility to record all data and in the event of a ?supervised individual? not being available for a survey, the contractor will ensure this is accomplished. 
5.	Suitable habitat will be assessed, and priority areas will be assigned for butterfly surveys based upon planned projects.  Direction on these priority areas will be provided by CEVNN staff.  
6.	A final report will detail the presence/absence of the ESBB, its actual distribution based upon 2007 surveys, and recommendations for habitat management.  Contractor will complete and submit California Natural Database forms for all positive sightings.  
7.	Contractor must submit a copy of current 10 (a) (1) (A) recovery permit for ?Take by Pursuit? of El Segundo Blue Butterfly from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service with bid offer.  In order to prevent duplicate efforts, this contract may not be awarded to persons who are already conducting surveys for the El Segundo Blue Butterfly on Vandenberg AFB in the 2007 adult flight season.
8.	Contractor must be willing to work in a positive and professional manner with all members of the VAFB ESBB Task team (VET), including 30 CES/CEVN and other contractor biologists.
9.	 Any findings of the ESBB will be IMMEADIATELY reported to a 30 CES/CEVNN biologist, to ensure proper notification measures through appropriate communication channels are accomplished.  Surveyors must wait at least 24 hours before sharing results of work with anyone outside of the VET team.  The purpose of this waiting period is to allow base leadership to be briefed on findings first, before the information is circulated.
10.	 Manuscripts intended for publication in any media shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), 15 days before submission for publication.  Review of such manuscripts is for comment to the Principal Investigator, and to ensure no information is released that may comprise national security.  Examples of information that is not suitable for public release include maps detailing base infrastructure or base operations.  The intent of this review is not for approval or disapproval of scientific content.  Courtesy copies of the reprint shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer and COR, even though publication may be subsequent to the expiration of the contract. 
11.	 The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of planned news releases, planned publicity, advertising material concerning contract work, and planned presentations to scientific meetings, prior to public release.  This is not intended to restrict dissemination of research information but to allow VAFB advance notice in order to adequately respond to inquiries. 
12.	 Manuscripts, reports, public releases and abstracts, which appear in professional journals, media and programs, shall include the following statements: 
a.	  "This work is supported by the Department of Defense under Contract No. XXXXXXXX." 
b.	"The views, opinions and/or findings contained in this report are those of the author(s) and should not be construed as an official Department of the Air Force position, policy or decision unless so designated by other documentation." 
13.	 This Statement of Work includes all labor and supplies for completing this project.  Period of Performance for this contract is 12 months from date of award.  Contact listed POCs for further information on deliverables.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the following item:

The contractor shall provide all labor, tools, parts, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation and supervision necessary to provide a focused survey of potential habitats for a butterfly found on Vandenberg AFB (VAFB).  The species found on VAFB was identified as Euphilotes battoides near allyni.  Euphilotes battoides allyni is the El Segundo Blue butterfly (ESBB), which is federally listed.  Previously, the ESBB was only found in four locations in the Los Angeles area.  Additionally, it was only thought to inhabit coastal sand dunes.  It is a biological anomaly that VAFB would have the ESBB given previous data.  The need for focused surveys for the ESBB is essential because potential habitat for the butterfly is widespread across the base, and the ESBB may actually inhabit a more limited area.  In the absence of a baseline survey, the FWS requires that all projects avoid any disturbance of potential habitat areas.  VAFB is forming an ESBB Action Team to conduct baseline surveys for ESBB and quantify potential habitat quality.  

Scope of Work:  

1.	The Surveyor shall complete 120 hours of field surveys for the El Segundo Blue Butterfly (ESBB) and its habitat during the flight period, which is June through August.
2.	The Surveyor must also provide 60 hours of support services with other members of the VAFB ESBB Action Team to accomplish tasks such as survey design, sharing results and discussing findings and conclusions. 
3.	All areas occupied by the ESBB and areas surveyed will be mapped using a GPS unit, and GIS shapefiles will be submitted to CEVNN upon completion of the surveys. Data collected should be accurate to within 10 meters.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractors Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 22 June 2006, 5:00 P.M.

<DESC>New Courier Service Questions

1.	Q. Time Table 1:  CLIN 0001, 1001, and 2001 Daily Service:  To reduce the number of trips (assuming the transported material will only be worked on during the normal business day) instead of delivery back to Ft. Meade at 6:00 PM is it acceptable to deliver the material in the morning prior to picking up that day?s material by securely storing the van overnight?
 
 A.   No 
		
2.	Item #4 Product Description, paragraph #3:  ?OPM may seek an equable adjustment for reduction in material.?  What formula will be used to determine this adjustment?  A concern is that we would be committed to providing a specific type of vehicle based on current volumes and if these volumes are significantly reduced our vehicle and associated costs will remain the same.
 
 A. 	At this point, OPM cannot predict the changes in technology that may cause volume reduction.   

3.	Q. Item #5 Security of OPM Documents, Correspondence and Material:  If one cleared driver must be in the vehicle at all times while transporting material, does this mean that a minimum of two drivers are required for each trip to accommodate lunch and personal relief stops?  Alternatively, is there an acceptable distance of the vehicle within which the driver must remain while not physically in the vehicle?
	 
A.	Two drivers would be an option but OPM would consider any proposal in which the material would be secured/safeguarded with only one driver.
B.	Please reference question # 12 for distance acceptability.

13.		Q. Past Performance       

	The contractor shall provide recent (past 3 years) and relevant (same or similar) 	work performed. For each contract/subcontract, include the following:

14.		Q. How do we price for weight of separate deliveries? The proposal mentioned 			that the weight could vary up to 2100lbs. 

A.	The solicitation is not priced out for weight but priced out as a firm fix price. There is no historical data to provide on weighted price.

15.		Q. Who is responsible for handling background checks, and clearances for 			anyone 	involved with these deliveries? Would we utilize the screening company 			that we 	currently do business with, or would OPM provide their own company for 			this service?

The storage facility will be subject to inspection and approval of the FISD Security and Safety Team.

17.		Q. On page 3 please elaborate on the statement in bold letters that says? THE 			CONTRACTOR MUST PROVIDE 2 COURIER VANS FOR THIS DAY TO 			COMPLETE CLIN 0001 OR CLINN 0002 AND 0003 FOR THAT DAY. Does this 			mean we will need 2 trucks on certain days? We were under the impression that 			it is the contractors decision to choose number of drivers and trucks used.

A.	The contractor must provide 2 vehicles for days when a REQUEST ONLY (CLIN 003) is made. When days REQUEST ONLY is not made, the contractor will choose vehicles and personnel.

18.		Q. On page 4 where it says ?CLIN 1003 UPON REQUEST ONLY? there is no 			attachment that asks for a price on this delivery. If it is required where should we 			answer it. 

A.	The Attachment B is the pricing sheet. You must request a copy by emailing joy.christie@opm.gov  .

<DESC>With this announcement, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Chicago District issues Modification 01 to COMBINED SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR STONE BLOCK SUPPLY FOR THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS STONE DOCK, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.  By way of this Modification, prospectiv e Offerors are informed that the QUOTE DUE DATE has been extended to 18 May 2007.  All quotes are due no later than close of business.  Two paragraphs have been added to the bottom of Section C.1.4   LOCATION in the Scope of Work.  This text will be added in its entirety to Section C of the resultant Contract. All questions regarding this Amendment shall be addressed to Anita Simpkins at (312) 846-5372 or Regina Blair at (312) 846-5371. REVISED SECTION C.1.4 LOCATION -  The delivery point shall be at the LRC Stone Dock, on the north side of the mouth of the Calumet River, in Chicago, IL.  The nearest street address is: 8555 South Green Bay Avenue, Chicago, IL.  This is the location of the public street intersection is Eas t 86th Street, and South Green Bay Avenue in the City of Chicago.  It is at this location that land-based site access to the LRC Stone Dock is obtained.  When entering the site at this location, traffic must pass through a guarded gate.  The contractor is advised that on weekends, the on-duty guard may close this gate during periodic site patrols.   These patrols are not conducted during the delivery times specified elsewhere in this document.   For marine deliveries, the stone dock unloading area provided by the Government will be a minimum size of 200 wide along the face of the dock, with a minimum water depth of 15 at the dock face.  Along the dock face, there is a 30 wide crane lane that is continually maintained for LRC Stone Dock loading operations.  Stone blocks may be temporarily placed into the crane lane during the contractors unloading operations, but will have to be moved immediately thereafter.  Please coordinate the final placem ent of stone blocks onto the dock site with the contract technical Point-of-Contact.   The Stone Dock area is only 420' wide x 172'.  It is currently half-full, with two large piles of materials present.  The longest distance that the contractor would have to travel depends on whether the delivery is made from the land side, or from the lake  side.  For a land-side delivery, the longest distance expected would be 230', and the average distance would be 175'.  There is a large amount of room of maneuver from the land side, as the adjacent property is unused, unvegetated, and flat.   For marine delivery, 3/4 of the blocks would have to be sent to the back of the dock, and the remaining 1/4 could be left right at the edge.  Along the dock face, there is presently a 20' wide lane used by LRC's crane.  Only in the far ends of this area co uld stone blocks be piled and left.  The longest distance necessary to travel from the dock face and around the existing material piles to the stone block storage areas would be 220', and the average distance would be 180'.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/solicitation number is W91ZLK-07-T-0453. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-07. The North American  Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 881310 and Small Business size standard is $6.5 MIL. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price Purchase Order resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to be delivered at Aberdeen Proving Ground,  MD for the following items: STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INTEGRATED TARGET PRESENTATION/SCORING SYSTEM Prepared by: U. S. ARMY ABERDEEN TEST CENTER (ATC) 400 Colleran Road Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005   CONTENTS Section	Page 1	Scope	1 1.1	Background	1 2	Applicable Documents	2 2.1	DOD Specification	2 2.2	Non-Government Standards and other Documents	2 3	Requirements	2 3.1	General	2 3.2	Hardware Development	2 3.3	Software Development	4 3.4	Data Recording and Reporting	6 3.5	Delivery	6 3.6	Technical Support Services	7 3.7	Clause	7 Statement of Work For Integrated Target Presentation/Scoring System 1.	SCOPE:  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the design, engineering development, calibration, testing, and installation of the Integrated Target Presentation/Scoring System for the United States Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) S oldier Systems Test Facility (SSTF) Small Arms Range.   This SOW also identifies technical support services for the Integrated Target Presentation/Scoring System that include user training for system operation and maintenance, and complete schematics and parts lists. 1.1.	Background:  ATC is the Armys lead test center for Soldier systems testing with a particular emphasis on the integration of future Warfighter systems with various weapon platforms.  The ATC SSTF handles testing of all items within Program Executive O ffice (PEO) Soldiers responsible areas, including Program Manager (PM) Weapons, PM Soldier, PM Soldier Equipment, and PM Sensors and Lasers.  A key focus area of the SSTF Small Arms Range is the integration of small caliber weapons with future soldier sys tems. The SSTF Small Arms Range consists of 8 firing positions, 11 target berms (25m, 50m, 100m, 150m, 200m, 250m, 300m, 350m, 400m, 450m and 500m), with 8 targets behind each berm, as shown in Figure 1.  Each target can be moved left or right about 1m.  The tar gets are instrumented with Meggitt-Defense Caswell AA10E target lifters that transmit data over a fiber optic network to a central range control computer (RCC) using UDP.  The range also contains a 50 foot rail which provides a moving pop-up target capabil ity.  Future SSTF Small Arms Range upgrades will extend the moving target rail to 100 feet and provide a similar capability at all berms.  The RCC transmits control messages to the target lifters and receives target status data from each target lifter over  the fiber optic network using TCP/IP and UDP.  The RCC controls the presentation and movement of targets on the range.  The AA10E target lifters are configured on independent network switches.  Additionally, the moving target uses a wireless link to trans mit data between the target lifter to an access point that is connected to the range fiber optic network.  Single phase, 110 VAC, 225 A power is supplied for the network switches and equipment, while single phase, 220 VAC, 225 A power is available for each  target lifter.   In order to evaluate Warfighter performance and integration of Warfigther systems with advanced weapon platforms more effectively, ATC needs to enhance the SSFT Small Arms Ra nge testing by providing the capability to determine the location of shots fired on stationary and moving targets.  Shot location data will be used in a feedback manner to control the subsequent presentation of targets so that tactically realistic target p resentation scenarios can be generated.        2.

ATC SSTF Small Arms Range Layout The contractor shall design and develop an integrated target lifter/scoring system that determines the position (horizontal and vertical) of rounds fired on static targets and on targets moving horizontally in front of the shooter for a distance of 100 fee t.  Additionally, the integrated system must be able to detect the location (horizontal and vertical) of each shot with an accuracy of at least twice the diameter of the round fired.  The system must also be capable of scoring rounds fired from any positio n along the firing line. The contractor shall design and develop an integrated target lifter/scoring system that complies with the specifications of the documents in Section 2 of this SOW. 3.2.2.	The contractor shall provide a rugged monitor for each of the 8 firing positions at the ATC SSTF Small Arms Range meeting MIL-STD-810F specifications and having non-glaring screens for use in bright sunlight.  The monitors must be compatible with th e SSTF Small Arms Range fiber optic network infrastructure and must operate using single phase, 110 VAC, 225 A power.   3.2.3.	The contractor shall provide a RCC that will report and store shooter p erformance and target status data, that will control individual target lifters, and that will operate over fiber optic network using Windows 2000 or later.  The system must also have sufficient video cards, memory, and processor speed to analyze and displa y data in real time. 3.3.	Software Development: 3.3.1.	The contractor shall design and develop the software necessary to operate and control the integrated target lifter/scoring system.  The software must provide the capability to manually override program instructions to conceal or expose targets and t o initiate or stop moving targets.  Additionally, the software must have the capability to build robust expose, conceal, and move routines that can be loaded into the RCC.  The software must provide the ability to establish the amount of time that targets remain exposed, set up the sequence for exposing and concealing targets, and set the speed of moving targets.   The software must also provide the capability to define multiple hit, kill, miss, and near miss zones on targets.  Figure 2 shows an example of possible target zone locations.  Each zone must be customizable in terms of shape and size.  The integrated syst em software must provide the capability to variably control the exposure and concealment of targets based on data from the target scoring components and the target lifters.   Figure 2.  Target Zone Identification Table 1 summarizes the required variable control of target presentation for static and moving targets.  Kill data will always conceal the target whether it is stationary or moving.  Hit data will either conceal or bob the target back and forth.  The bo bbing of the target can be used to simulate hitting someone who is wearing ballistic protection.  For moving targets, any hit signal will conceal the target.  A miss signal will continue to expose the target and then conceal the target after a user-def ined period of time for both static and moving targets.  Near miss data will allow the target to remain exposed and then be concealed after a user-defined time for stationary and moving targets.  A near miss will also bob a target or conceal the target  to simulate someone reacting to hostile fire.   Table 1.   Variable target presentation control based on scoring data LETHALITY PROFILE TARGET	KILL	HIT	MISS	NEAR MISS STATIC	Conceal target	Conceal target or bob target and then expose target	Expose target, and then conceal after user definable time	Expose target or bob target or conceal target after user definable time MOVING	Conceal target and continue moving to limit switch	Conceal target and continue moving to limit switch or stop	Continue to expose target and move to limit switch.  Conceal after user definable time	Continue to expose target or conceal target and cont inue to move towards limit switch or stop    3.3.2.	The contractor shall design and develop a database to store all target scoring and target lifter data.  The contractor shall also design and develop a database interface allowing access to the database via common database transfer protocols.  3.4.	Data Recording and Reporting: 3.4.1.	The contractor shall develop an integrated target lifter/scoring system where all data generated from the system is stored in a database accessible via common database transfer protocols.  Data shall be reported to the central range control system f or immediate feedback to the testers.  Also, data will be reported to the firing lane monitors for real time feedback to the shooters.   3.4.2.	The data reported to the RCC will display the location (x and y position) of all shots on a target within the detection zone, the lethality (kill, hit, near miss, miss) of each shot, and the status (concealed or exposed) of all 88 targets.  RCC will  also display the number of kills, hits, near misses, and misses and the total number of shots for each shooter and for each target engaged.  The RCC will also display the sequence of s hots from each shooter, the velocity and origin each shot, target identification, and shooter identification.  Additionally, the RCC will display the speed and direction of moving targets, the distance from the firing point to the target, the air temperatu re near each target, and shooter performance statistics. 3.4.3.	The firing lane monitors will display a digital picture of each target, the number of shots fired, the sequence of shots, the severity (kill, hit, near miss, or miss) of each shot, and shooter performance statistics. . 3.4.4.	Additional data to record will be time of target exposure, time of target engagement, time of target kill/hit/near miss/miss, and time of target concealment. 3.4.5.	The system must allow provide standard U.S. Army scoring reports and allow for customization of reports.   3.5.	Delivery: 3.5.1.	The contractor shall provide the hardware and equipment to install the integrated target lifter/scoring systems at the ATC SSTF Small Arms Range.   3.5.2.	The contractor shall install, setup, configure, calibrate, and test the integrated target lifter/scoring systems at each of the 88 SSTF Small Arms Range targets. 3.5.3.	The contractor shall install, setup, configure, calibrate, and test the 8 shooter performance monitors along the firing line.   3.6.	Technical Support Services: 3.6.1.	The contractor shall provide training on the operation and configuration of the integrated target lifter/scoring systems, on the firing lane monitors, and on the range control system. 3.6.2.	The contractor shall provide clear and concise operations and maintenance manuals for the integrated target lifter/scoring system.  The manuals must contain detailed drawings and schematics of the system and components that comply with the documents  specified in Section 2.0 of this SOW. 3.7.	Clause:  The contractor shall provide a signed agreement from MDS-Caswell stating consent to work with the contractor for the purpose of integrating a target scoring capability with the MDS-Caswell AA10E target lifters already installed at the ATC SST F Small Arms Range. The contract will be awarded to Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).
