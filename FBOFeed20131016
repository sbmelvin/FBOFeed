The NSRDEC is responsible for the development of technical data packages used to procure its multiple commodities. This requires maintenance of the engineering data, such as drawings.  CAD/Drawings are one of the most important components of a technical data package.  Once an item has completed development and is ready for procurement, the drawing package is placed under configuration management and any subsequent changes-corrections, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) etc.-need to be strictly documented and recorded.  This situation results in a sporadic level of activity involving drafting and the insertion of the changes into the drawing package so that it remains up-to-date, accurate, and available for procurement and re-procurement.  This contract is intended to provide the NSRDEC and Natick Soldier Systems Center (NSSC) partner organizations, with CAD/Drawings and solid models for the generation and modification of drawing packages through individual task orders. <br>  <br> The Government is anticipating awarding a single Firm Fixed Price Five Year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a minimum value of $3,000.00 and a maximum value of $6,000,000.00. Contract minimum and maximum limitations may be fulfilled by a combination of Task Orders.  Funds will be obligated on individual Task Orders, and not on the basic contract.  The services are nonseverable and the Government intends to conduct discussions but reserves the right to award without discussions.  The Government may award one or no contracts as a result of the solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541340, and the size standard is $7.0 Million. <br>  <br> When released, the solicitation, including all amendments and applicable documents, will be available in electronic medium on or about 1 November 2013 via Fedbizopps.gov (Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Sean Auld, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at Sean.G.Auld.civ@mail.mil.   <br>  <br> Additional Info:  <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br>  <br> Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground CCAP-SCN, ATTN: Natick Contracting Division, Building 1, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5011 <br>  <br> Place of Performance:  <br>  <br> USA Signal Network Enterprise Center-Natick (NEC), Natick Soldier Systems Center  <br> Building 1, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5011 <br>  <br> Point of Contact:  <br>  <br> Sean Auld <br> Sean.G.Auld.civ@mail.mil

The daily base flow is expected to be approximately 350 cfs and there should be protective measures to handle flows from storm events. An average storm event can produce a storm spike from 1,000 to 1,500 cfs while larger events can produce floods exceeding 10,000 cfs.</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis of Repair Basic Operations Agreement (BOA) N00104-08-G-A306 with Exelis Inc, D/B/A Radar, Reconnaissance and Undersea Systems, 7821 Orion Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91409-7713, and serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by the NAVSUP-WSS-M for the period of 22 November 2013 to 22 November 2014, for the evaluation and repair of various repair components in support of the ANS/SPS-48 Radar System.  The restored items will be returned to supply system stock or issued for immediate Fleet use.  Several major items to be restored are: 7H 5998 014754711, P/N 275822-3 Circuit Card Assembly; 7H 5840 012219447, P/N 168268-1 Converter Module; 7H 5950 012219465, P/N 248118-1, Transformer, Pulse.
  Technical data is not available and can not be furnished.
A complete lists of potential repairable items for which orders may be placed is available upon request to the buyer listed under POC, Isabel M. Manske.   Individual orders exceeding $25,000.00 will be synopsized pursuant to FAR subpart 5.3.
Numbered note 22 applies: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of far 6.30 2-1.  All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, quotations or capability statements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement (boa) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1) because the government does not currently posses data necessary to compete the items solicited hereunder.
  Guidance in NAVSUP-WSS solicitation language identified as LA27LN, Alternate Products Offered, applies to companies expressing an interest in supplying these items.  The test of the clause is available at http://www.neco.navy.mil/clauses.cfm.

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to establish Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00383-14-G-002D for the repair of components used on the MV/CV-22 aircraft. Honeywell International Inc (02LU7), Tempe, AZ, is the only authorized source of repair for this item due to being a critical application item (CAI) and is the only authorized source by NAVAIR. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. The following is the high dollar value item for repair: Generator, Variable Frequency NSN 1680-01-521-5190 V2, P/N 901-375-002-401. For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Allen Neyland at (215) 697-4314.

The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP-WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVSUP-WSS PCO. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP-WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
 Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<CONTACT>Kathy Lauden, Contracting Officer, Phone 937-257-4273, Email kathy.lauden.1@u.af.mil - Kimberly Poole, Program Manager, Phone 937-904-0472, Email kimberly.poole@us.af.mil
<DESC><p align="left">The purpose of this contract will be continued deployment of the existing DEAMS Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS) 11i baseline AF-wide. This deployment includes development and sustainment for ongoing release work. DEAMS has determined that the currently-fielded capability comprises approximately 80% of the total DEAMS System Capability Document (SCD). The DEAMS Milestone B strategy included an Oracle eBS R12 upgrade/re-implementation to aid in achieving remaining SCD performance. However, during the 2013 Courses of Action (COA) analysis, it was determined that Oracle eBS R12 was not necessary to achieve performance described in the SCD and required in Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), Key System Attributes (KSAs), Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), Measures of Suitability (MOSs). Implementation of the existing Oracle eBS 11i DEAMS baseline with prioritized improvements would enable the program to stay on track to meet SCD performance, KPPs, KSAs, MOEs, MOSs, IOT&amp;E, and Full Deployment by 2017 to aid in facilitating Air Force Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) compliance. Of the remaining undeveloped 20% of DEAMS capability described in the SCD, approximately 10% will be the priority focus to improve performance described in KPPs, KSAs, MOEs, MOS and facilitate future deployments. The final 10% of capability described in the SCD will be addressed as needed in future releases after full deployment is achieved. The deferral of the Oracle eBS R12 upgrade and refocus of the development effort was most efficiently re-organized into the existing Increment 1. Increment 2 remains undefined, but will likely include the deferred Oracle upgrade and any additional or emergent SCD requirements.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice - Request for Quote (RFQ)<br />USPS Transportation Category Management Center<br />Washington DC
<p><br />Air Transportation Service December 18, 2013</p>
<p>In accordance with the Postal Service's Supplying Principles and Practices, the Postal Service is issuing a request for quote (RFQ) as a source sought notice. This is an invitation for potential suppliers to submit price quotes for providing air transportation, ground handling and deicing services for the peak offshore operation. The dedicated offshore operation will provide point-to-point air transportation service, defined as round trip transportation on Wednesday, December 18, 2013 between Memphis, Tennessee (MEM), and two of following destinations: Anchorage, Alaska (ANC), Honolulu, Hawaii (HNL), and San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU). Attachment 1, Service Schedules, of the resultant contract will contain the finalized schedules for these flights.</p>
<p>This does not imply a commitment to acquire the services from any responding supplier. An RFQ provides the Postal Service with useful information to further assess innovative solutions and a better understanding of how the requirement can best be met.</p>
<p>Your quote for the service should be submitted using the attached Pricing Matrix Template by no later than Friday,&nbsp;October 25, 2013&nbsp;at&nbsp;5:00pm EST. Please submit your quotes via email to:</p>
<p>Erika Ramirez<br />Purchasing and Supply Management Specialist<br />Erika.v.ramirez@usps.gov<br />202-268-5846<br /><br />Scope of Service</p>
<p>The supplier will provide Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance (ACMI), ground handling, deicing and related support services, including customer support and provisions for recovery.</p>
<p>The Postal Service or its agent will provide terminal handling support services of mail unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The Postal Service will provide fuel necessary to complete contracted routes. Payment reconciliation for fuel usage will occur after the period of performance is completed.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of Performance will be Wednesday, December 18, 2013.</p>
<p>Aircraft</p>
<p>Based on the projected demand, the Postal Service requires a total of two 747 freighter aircraft or two aircraft that can transport 130,000 pounds each.</p>
<p>The contracted aircraft will operate as fully dedicated aircraft during the date and hours of operation as specified within the Service Schedule(s) (Attachment 1). The aircraft must be available for loading and unloading per the times stated within the Service Schedule(s).</p>
<p>The type, quantity, and tail number of the aircraft will remain fixed for the entire term of the contract, unless a change or modification is approved by the contracting officer. The proposed dedicated aircraft for this operation will be required to carry mail up to the limit of the aircraft's lift capacity. The supplier must be able to transport all classes and types of mail up to the maximum published weight limit.</p>
<p>The supplier must maintain all aircraft in compliance with Federal Aviation Regulations as applicable to the type of certificate for aircraft provided, (for example, Part 121, subpart L) as applicable, and all other applicable U.S. Government regulations. The supplier is completely and exclusively responsible for the safety and maintenance (and all applicable maintenance costs) of aircraft.</p>
<p>The supplier must provide fully trained and qualified flight crews who are certified under FAR 121 regulations to operate all flights.</p>
<p>The supplier must comply with all Federal and local noise abatement restrictions at airports served, including alternate landing sites.</p>
<p>The supplier will acquire all landing slots and pay all parking and landing fees at each air stop and the alternate landing sites used in the performance of duties under this contract.</p>
<p>The supplier shall maintain operating capability at one alternate landing site for each airport.</p>
<p>Replacement Aircraft</p>
<p>The supplier must have the availability of one replacement aircraft capable of transporting 130,000 pounds per trip and crew to recover the service within 6 (six) hours of the scheduled departure time of the grounded aircraft. For example, if the aircraft is scheduled to depart at 1700 and becomes inoperable, then a replacement aircraft should be in place by 2300. In addition, the supplier will be required to work an agreed upon schedule to ensure all trips are returned to original service schedules within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Fuel</p>
<p>The Postal Service has implemented a fuel purchase program and intends to purchase aviation fuel for aircraft operated under the provisions of this contract. The supplier is required to obtain fuel from the designated source available at each location as specified.</p>
<p>If, for any reason, the Postal Service is unable to obtain fuel, the supplier will be responsible for obtaining and uploading all aviation fuel necessary to operate the aircraft. Upon notification, the supplier will become responsible for any and all costs associated with aviation fuel and its upload into the aircraft. In the event of this change in requirements, the Postal Service and the supplier will re-negotiate the terms and conditions of the contract to provide for reimbursement of fuel costs.</p>
<p>Deicing</p>
<p>The supplier will provide deicing services at the ANC and MEM air stops (as applicable.)</p>
<p>Delivery</p>
<p>1. The air transportation supplier will make mail available for unloading by the supplier's designated agent or the Postal Service, from the aircraft by opening aircraft cargo doors. For purposes of performance measurement, delivery will be defined through the following events:</p>
<p>&bull; Aircraft Arrival: defined by the "block in" time</p>
<p>&bull; Available for Unload: defined by the time the cargo door is opened and the aircraft is available to the ground handler personnel to safely enter aircraft</p>
<p>&bull; Unload Complete: defined by the time the last container or piece of mail is removed from aircraft</p>
<p>&bull; Mail Delivered: defined by the time the final piece or unit of mail is presented to the designated delivery point as specified in this document or Service Schedule.</p>
<p>&bull; All mail must be delivered at or before the scheduled delivery time. The air transportation supplier must not impede the ground handling operations.</p>
<p>2. The Postal Service expects the supplier to provide a high level of on-time performance so that the Postal Service can provide timely delivery of mail to its customers. The supplier's daily operational performance will be considered in determining service reliability and for purposes of renewal and future contract awards.</p>
<p><br />Division of Operational Responsibilities</p>
<p>Air Transportation Supplier:</p>
<p>The air transportation supplier must cooperate and work collaboratively with the Postal Service or its agents and, where appropriate, the terminal handling suppliers to ensure optimal performance throughout the entire operation. Functional responsibilities will be divided as follows:</p>
<p>The air transportation supplier must:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide aircraft for air transportation line haul service</p>
<p>&bull; Operate aircraft in order to transport mail between air stops specified in this document and Attachments</p>
<p>&bull; Schedule fueling with plane agent</p>
<p>&bull; Provide deicing services in ANC and MEM (as applicable)</p>
<p>&bull; Provide ground handling services in ANC, HNL, MEM, and SJU (as applicable); and will be responsible for other aspects of ramp operations, including:</p>
<p>o Unlocking and opening the aircraft main cargo door<br />o Download/Upload of aircraft<br />o De-icing<br />o Approval and acceptance of load plan<br />o Maintenance and preflight inspection<br />o Closing and locking the aircraft main cargo door <br />o Crew transport to and from aircraft<br />o Providing a tail stand for the aircraft, if necessary<br />o Providing an air start if necessary<br />o Providing for Ground Power Unit (GPU) services, if necessary, for service beyond loading and unloading or other services required by the Postal Service<br />o All Lavatory, water and other related services<br />o Entering required data elements into computer software program, CORE Transport Technologies, Inc.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide drayage service from HNL airport to:</p>
<p>HNL P&amp;DC Air Cargo Unit <br />3600 Aolele St<br />Honolulu, HI 96820<br /><br />&bull; Prepare flight plans, and provide other support services necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft</p>
<p>&bull; Open cargo doors of aircraft and permit containers to be loaded onto the aircraft main deck, and mailbags and parcels (i.e., loose load mail) to be loaded into the lower cargo compartments of the aircraft</p>
<p>&bull; Provide adequate staffing to operate aircraft, and manage its flight operation</p>
<p>&bull; Provide adequate crew in order to prevent flights from being delayed due to lack of crew hours</p>
<p>&bull; Assign an individual fully dedicated to the Postal Service as a contact person</p>
<p>&bull; Notify ground handling supplier's load planner of the aircraft registration number and total payload available for the aircraft assigned to each route</p>
<p>&bull; Approve the completed load plan prepared for each aircraft by the ground-handling supplier</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a Loadmaster support for each aircraft provided</p>
<p>&bull; Communicate via the CORE system each time an event causes an impact of 15 minutes or more to the flight schedule. The supplier must input the data into the CORE system immediately after becoming aware of the event. In addition, for flights involving a Memphis, TN, arrival or departure, the supplier must notify the local Memphis, TN, Postal representative. Contact information will be provided upon contract award</p>
<p>&bull; Inform the ground-handling supplier of any and all aircraft schedule changes or delays which could affect incoming and outgoing traffic, including, but not limited to, maintenance, repair, and de-icing requirements</p>
<p>The Postal Service will not be responsible to provide crew lounge or lavatory services at any air stop.</p>
<p>Special Note - Ground Handling and Deicing:<br />If the air transportation supplier's de-icing and ground handling services proposal is not deemed to offer the best value to the Postal Service, price and other factors considered, the Postal Service will provide the de-icing and ground handling services through its agents. In this case, the air transportation supplier will not be responsible for providing ground handling or de-icing services, but will be expected to cooperate with the Postal Service's agents.</p>
<p>Service Requirements</p>
<p>The service frequency is defined within the Service Schedule for each origin and destination segment.</p>
<p>The air transportation supplier may be requested to provide service beyond the scope of the Service Schedule frequency, during the remaining term of the contract. Additionally, the air transportation supplier may be required to divert its aircraft as a result of unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of either party. In the event of such diversion, the air transportation supplier will operate at the mutually agreed upon pre-negotiated rates per block hour multiplied by the substantiated and agreed upon block hours necessary to provide the diversionary service.</p>
<p>Schedules</p>
<p>The flight schedules accepted by the Postal Service will become the contractual schedule of operations and will remain fixed for the term of the contract. This includes the aircraft types, quantity, and tail-numbered aircraft, which are proposed. The supplier must not arrive later than, nor depart earlier than, the times in the agreed upon schedule (Attachment 1) unless specifically authorized by the contracting officer.</p>
<p><br />Trip Cancellation</p>
<p>If the contracting officer orders a cancellation of any of the scheduled/optional flights, the supplier will be compensated based on the pre-negotiated cancellation rates.</p>
<p>A scheduled segment trip may be canceled by the contracting officer if the supplier's previous flight's non-compliant performance of service results in a "domino-effect" situation causing an inability of the supplier to meet the Postal Service's requirements for remaining flights. In the event of this reason for a Postal Service ordered trip cancellation, the air transportation supplier will not be compensated for service that was canceled.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>The supplier will have the responsibility to establish, implement, administer and maintain a security program that encompasses all facets of the operation and meets all Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA), Transportation Security Agency (TSA), Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and local airport authority requirements regarding airport security. The Postal Inspection Service has the right to conduct inspections at any time.</p>
<p>Further, the supplier must cooperate fully with any security program implemented by the ground or terminal handling supplier stated within this contract or applicable through Postal regulations that complies with applicable FAA and local airport authority requirements regarding airport security or that provides for security of mail while in the supplier's custody and control.</p>
<p>The air transportation supplier will exercise due diligence to ensure the mail entrusted to them receive proper security by the employees. See Attachment 2 Personnel Screening.</p>
<p>Air Transportation System Support</p>
<p>The Postal Service intends to implement the use of the "Aircraft Schedule Alerting System (ASAS)" operated by CORE Transport Technologies, Inc. (CORE) for computer-assisted management of air transportation and associated activities for this contract.</p>
<p>The purpose is to monitor mail volume flows; establish an historical record of mail transport events; identify irregularities; recommend assessments; and certify mail handling and transportation flow events for payment.</p>
<p>This will be achieved by: (a) linking real-time flight information with pre-flight loading and post flight unloading information; (b) proactively notifying appropriate staff (Postal Service and third party contractors) of schedule anomalies that require management intervention; and (c) linking this data with contractual data to calculate budgetary impacts.</p>
<p>The supplier will be required to perform all CORE data entry functions as specified in the document attached to this contract. See Attachment 3 Data Entry.</p>
<p>FAA and Local Airport Authority Requirements</p>
<p>The supplier must comply with all lawful requirements of FAA and local airport authorities. This includes, but is not limited to, reporting flight schedules, weight and balance compliance, noise abatement, ramp access restrictions, de-icing procedures, landing restrictions, and other matters within the jurisdiction of such authorities to include liability insurance.</p>

<DESC>Labor Market Survey: In addressing projects within the scope of Executive Order 13502, USACE districts will need to undertake a labor market survey as part of their PLA evaluation process. USACE district PDTs should consider the following:
<p>1. Issuing a Sources Sought Notice:<br />The Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the following large scale construction project:</p>
<p>Beachfill, Absecon Island, Atlantic County, New Jersey</p>
<p>Project Description: Contract work consists of a base bid to place approximately 2,000,000 cubic yards of beachfill, along the Atlantic Ocean coastline of Absecon Island, Atlantic County, New Jersey. The project area encompasses the municipalities of Ventnor, Margate and Longport. The contract work may also consist of separate options to place additional amounts of beachfill per option, if awarded, in locations within and outside of the Base bid areas. The project work for the Base Bid and Options, if awarded, also may include, in addition to beachfill: the construction or repair of pedestrian, vehicle, and handicap dune crossovers; planting dune grass; providing sand fencing; the repair or extension of existing storm water outfalls; and the relocation or removal of various existing structures to accommodate the beachfill and dunes. The beachfill material for this contract must come from the authorized borrow area located approximately 2 - 3 miles offshore of Absecon Island in the Atlantic Ocean, as designated on the contract drawings.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $10,000,000.00 and $25,000,000.00</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project. <br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Beach Fill project at Absecon Island, Atlantic County, New Jersey? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Beach Fill project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?</p>
<p>g. How will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small business utilization goals?</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email to Michelle Johnson, Contract Specialist, at Michelle.L.Johnson@usace.army.mil no later than 12:00 P.M. (EST) on 30 October 2013.</p>

<CONTACT>Lt Col Jason Voorheis, F-15 EPAWSS Program Manger , Email jason.voorheis@us.af.mil - Adam J. Arnold , Contract Negotiator , Email adam.arnold.5@us.af.mil
<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) is now planning for the F-15 Eagle Passive / Active Survivability and Warning System (EPAWSS) program to replace the existing F-15 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) with an internal integrated modern Electronic Warfare (EW) system integrated into the F-15C and F-15E series aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The F-15 Division intends for the F-15 EPAWSS program to leverage non-developmental components with all critical technologies demonstrated at least at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or higher according to the standard definition found in DoD TRA Guidance, 13 May 2011, Section 2.5.
<p>At this time, the USAF considers a critical technology to be the ability to accomplish the Radio Frequency (RF) signal handling and processing necessary to perform the radar warning receiver (RWR), emitter identification, response time, geolocation, and electronic countermeasures jamming functions in congested RF environments (consisting of hostile, friendly (including wingman), neutral military emitters, plus civil and commercial signals).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In recognition of key risks associated with successfully accomplishing these functions, the USAF is considering making the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensor Directorate Integrated Demonstrations and Applications Laboratory (IDAL) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH available for Hardware in the loop (HWIL) demonstration to potential F-15 EPAWSS suppliers to gather performance data relevant to the characterization of system maturity and readiness.</p>
<p>Participation in this IDAL technology demonstration would be limited to EW suppliers with non-developmental components, would be voluntary and would not be a prerequisite to pursuing F-15 EPAWSS opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the anticipated F-15 EPAWSS acquisition approach, it is expected that Boeing will participate in IDAL activities and have access to all performance data collected under this arrangement. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The USAF will fund all tasks performed by IDAL personnel, which will include writing the resulting reports to be provided to each participating EW supplier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The USAF will not fund EW suppliers for their planning, personnel, equipment modifications, technology demonstrations or any other costs associated with IDAL participation activities.</p>
<p>The IDAL availability discussed in this notice is currently planned for March through April 2014.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is expected each participating EW supplier will support up to three IDAL test planning meetings and two one-week evaluation periods, to exercise their proposed system in the IDAL simulation environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first evaluation period is expected to consist of equipment set-up and trial runs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The second evaluation period is envisioned to be the actual demonstration.</p>
<p>The top level objectives of this IDAL demonstration are to: 1) enable the demonstration of maturity of EW supplier systems (hardware and software operating together) at TRL 6 or higher and 2) inform schedule risk assessment and the development of program plans to address risks during EMD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested EW suppliers with non-developmental components are invited to assess the simulation capabilities of the AFRL's IDAL and decide if and how data collected may be useful in substantiating performance and risk assertions that might be made in their future subcontract proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Data collected via IDAL will be based on a standardized RF environment, scenarios, and emitter parameters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The specifics of the RF environment simulation will be made available prior to the IDAL demonstration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The USAF recognizes a final set of detailed F-15 EPAWSS technical requirements would be helpful in preparing for an IDAL technology demonstration but cannot commit at this time to establishing the specific F-15 EPAWSS technical requirements for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program prior to conduct of the IDAL demonstration.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions between participating EW suppliers and the AFRL organization governing the conduct of the demonstration and the treatment of the data will be agreed upon prior to the demonstration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The USAF is considering the use of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) as an assistance instrument to facilitate the IDAL demonstrations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additional information concerning the potential use of a CRADA will be provided as it becomes available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<a href="mailto:thomas.campanajr@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information and Special Notice only, not a Request For Proposal (RFP). <br> The Program Executive Office, Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) on behalf of Headquarters, Department of the Army is notifying all interested parties concerning the planned Army Mission Command Modernization support contract previously identified under solicitation numbers W15P7T-13-T-TC01, W15P7T-13-R-TC01, and W15P7T-13-R-0075.   <br> The purpose of this notice is to advise interested parties of the current status of this solicitation.  Due to fiscal challenges posed in FY13, and the continuing FY14 budgetary challenges, release of this solicitation not expected until late October 2013, subject to availability of FY 14 funding.  Upon release of the RFP, it is anticipated respondents will have 30 days to respond to the solicitation. <br> It is anticipated that this effort will be released as a TOTAL (100%) SMALL BUSINESS set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.2 and Subpart 19.14. <br> Background:  <br>  The goal of Army Mission Command Modernization is to develop and field a versatile and affordable mix of the best equipment available to allow Soldiers and units to succeed in both today's and tomorrow's full spectrum military operations. The 2012 Army Modernization Strategy defines how the U.S. Army continues to modernize and transform to fulfill our mission to sustain our Soldiers and maintain readiness of the world's strongest, and most capable Army. It describes the Army's efforts to ensure that Soldiers have the best equipment and necessary capabilities to guarantee their success in any mission or environment. The strategy is designed to describe the Army's overarching goals, priorities, and objectives to both internal and external audiences so that the Army can achieve unity of purpose in its modernization efforts.  <br>  <br> The Army Mission Command modernization strategy is a team effort across the Army and TRADOC that is focused on the convergence of several systems, providing increased information superiority on the move. The Army's network includes non-developmental Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) systems, which were fielded to fill capability gaps primarily in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Current and future Army Mission Command programs will address these capability gaps and reduce the current number of nonstandard products across the battlefield.  Concurrently, there will be sufficient programmatic flexibility to allow the Army to incorporate, support, and field emerging capabilities.  Starting in FY 13, the Army will incrementally transition from the current legacy and segmented Commercial Off- the-Shelf (COTS) network systems to a centralized network system.  To achieve this, the Army will field integrated Capability Sets (CSs) and incrementally modernize the baseline network systems over time, in particular Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T), Family of Networked Tactical Radios, and Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P). The intent is to integrate these Mission Command portfolio elements into one affordable, coherent grid of sensors, Soldiers, platforms, and command posts linked by a robust transport network enabling an integrated suite of Mission Command applications to provide the Warfighters greater access to the larger network capabilities and services.  <br>  <br> The proposed Army Mission Command Modernization Strategic Services effort supports the analysis, assessment and development of strategic documents and programs for Program Objective Memorandum (POM) FY16-20 and beyond, tied to Army Force Generation Model (ARFORGEN) Process. This support will consist of the following areas: Mission Command Portfolio Strategy (i.e. Transport, Command Post, Handheld, Network Operations, Common Operating Environment, Network Integration Evaluation, Testing); Requirements Generation; Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Support Services; Force Development Capability Set Fielding and Platform Integration Support.  <br> Responses:   <br> Only interested SDVOSB firms who believe they are capable of providing the above mentioned services and that meet SECRET clearance requirements are invited to indicate their interest by providing:  <br>  	Company name <br>  	Company address <br>  	Overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address) <br>  	CAGE Code <br>  	Point of contact <br>  	E-mail address, <br>  	Telephone number <br>  	Fax number <br> All responses shall be unclassified and reference Solicitation Number W15P7T-13-R-0075 <br>  <br> Submission of Information:  <br> All submissions should be in Microsoft Word for Office 2007 or a compatible format. Responses to this RFI shall be unclassified and should not exceed 1 page in length. Telephone or verbal inquiries regarding this notice will not be honored.   <br> Responses to the RFI will not be returned and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their response to this RFI. All interested parties are invited to submit a response to this RFI on or before 3:00 PM US Eastern Time on 22 October 2013. All responses and questions under this RFI must be transmitted electronically via e-mail to Thomas.campanajr@us.army.mil.  TELEPHONIC INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. <br>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to extend Contract N00421-12-C-0007, in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. The contractor is The MIL Corporation, 4000 Mitchellville, Rd STE A210 Bowie, MD 20716-3177. This effort will provide continuity of engineering and technical services to the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Integrated Battle Space Simulation and Test (IBST) department, Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RTD&amp;E) Infrastructure Division at Patuxent River, MD, while the follow-on Seaport-e Task Order is being completed. This extension covers a period of performance of approximately six (6) months that will commence on 18 November 2013 and end on 19 May 2014. This extension is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to expend all ceiling as of 17 November 2013. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently performed under Contract N00421-12-C-0007 and the need to continue these services without a break in support, The MIL Corporation is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on Seaport-e Task Order. <br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The incumbent contractor currently has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution of the required work. Re-solicitation for the six (6) month period would not only result in a break in service but would incur excessive costs to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information, contact Michelle E. Johnson, Code 2.5.1.6.8 via email at michelle.e.johnson@navy.mil.<br />Per FAR Subpart 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy requirements". The MIL Corporation is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating an impact on project schedules and operations that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services at an acceptable level for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs, the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this requirement will be procured on a sole source basis. <br />

<CONTACT>Gloria E. Bailey, 407-380-8508

<a href="mailto:gloria.bailey1@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC> <br> The purpose of this posting is to: <br>  <br> 1.  Provide an Email address for all communication related to the TEACH acquisition. All communication, from the date of this posting forward, shall be sent in writing, to the following address TEACHacq@peostri.army.mil.   Emails sent to mailboxes other than TEACHacq@peostri.army.mil will not be considered and will not receive a response. <br>   <br> All questions received will be consolidated, answered and posted at a later date on FedBizOpps. Please mark submitted proprietary information/data accordingly. The Government reserves the right to make public any information that would provide clarification on the requirement for industry in preparing for proposals.   <br>  <br> 2.  Provide a revised TEACH base contract PWS and Task Order (TO) Performance Work Statements (PWSs) for industry review.  Two of the TO PWSs are provided today and the third one will be posted shortly. The TO PWSs represent a cross section of the type of requirements both in complexity and estimated dollar value anticipated for award under the TEACH Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (MAIDIQ) contracts.  The potential exists for any or all of these draft requirements to be competed and awarded with the TEACH IDIQs.  There are multiple reference documents and additional information related to the draft PWSs which  have distribution restrictions and will be made available at a later date with request instructions (see attached). <br>  <br> SEND ALL QUESTIONS/INQUIRIES RELATED TO THESE PWSs TO TEACHacq@peostri.army.mil. <br>  <br> 3.  Provide the proposed Small Business (SB) strategy for the TEACH procurement.  This is the current strategy being considered for TEACH; it has not yet been submitted through the review and approval process (which includes the Army Office of Small Business Programs and culminates with concurrence by the Office of the Secretary of Defense) and thus this strategy is still subject to change. <br>  <br> The following is the proposed SB strategy: <br>  <br> TEACH will be issued as one solicitation, under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, 611430 - Professional and Management Development Training with a $10M average annual receipts threshold for SBs. Large Businesses (LBs) will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.  Both LBs and SBs will be required to submit a SB participation plan and comply with a proposed 40% SB participation requirement. There will be one suite (or lot) for proposal submission and evaluation purposes.  The MAIDIQ contract awards will be made to the selected Offerors, both small and large businesses, who demonstrate the ability to cover the depth and breadth of training and training related services as delineated in the TEACH Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The Government committed to making a minimum number of SB prime IDIQ contract awards (reserves in accordance with FAR 19.502-4(a)) for the TEACH effort. <br>  <br> 4.  Provide a Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 solicitation number and re-baseline documents related to this acquisition.  With this FY14 announcement, all previous draft documents, Q&A and data posted under announcements: W900KK-13-R-0011, W900KK-12-R-0000 and W900KK-11-R-RFISERVICES are null and void unless reposted under this new solicitation announcement. The prior postings will be archived. <br>  <br> General Information: <br> The Government will continue to provide information, draft document and other program updates on www.fbo.gov website as they become available. FedBizOpps is the authoritative source for this effort. Industry is highly encouraged to monitor this website for future postings. Please direct all questions/comment regarding this posting in writing to TEACHacq@peostri.army.mil. <br>

SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICE/COSTS
 
 This is a basic ordering agreement for the period of one year from the date of award with four (4) one (1) year options, in accordance with FAR 16.7.    A contract is formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, when VA agrees to place a patient in the nursing home and the nursing home agrees to accept the patient.  Upon acceptance by the contractor of beneficiaries of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), all terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply during such time as a VA patient remains in that nursing home at the expense of VA.
 
 Upon acceptance of a VA patient by the nursing home, if and when requested by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the contractor shall furnish all supplies and services herein described, at the per diem rates for the levels of care specified below.  VA levels of care are defined in Section D of this agreement.  VA is obligated only to the extent authorized placements of patients are made under this agreement.
 
 B.2 RATE DETERMINATION
 
 The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing homes plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the cost of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local state Medicaid agency (SMA).  Rates established after the effective date of this agreement will require a modification to the agreement.  

 VA shall use Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.
 
 For all levels of nursing care a percentage is added for routine ancillary services/supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen (occasional use), x-ray, laboratory, physician visits, and rental equipment.
 
 Special equipment, e.g. clinitron bed, is/are not considered routine ancillary services (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Rehabilitation therapies shall be provided as a distinct level of care.  Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate.  VA or other payers shall be used for Hospice and Dialysis, as determined by the veteran with VA approval.
 
 B.3 ORAL MEDICATIONS
 
 Oral medications, which comprise more than 8.5% of the per diem rate on a monthly basis, are excluded from that rate.  High drug costs shall be determined or priced using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of the drugs plus a transaction fee of 3% per month.  All calculations shall be made on a monthly basis.  When a high cost drug patient is identified, VA staff must be advised promptly to establish an appropriate course of action, which shall include the provision of the medications by VA.
 
B.4 	ANCILLARY COSTS
Ancillary cost are pre-approved costs for supplies or services not identified as included in the all-inclusive rate or any other pre-authorized rate or schedule or payment for items or services provided under this agreement.  Ancillary costs such as medications, special equipment, rehabilitation therapies, shall not be added to any invoice without written permission of the VA medical center placing the veteran.  If permission is received, the nursing home must also submit the physician's order for the medication/supply, the dispensing log, the supplier and the cost charged by the supplier to the nursing home, and what the nursing home is charging the VA.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK
 
   B.1. This Basic Ordering Agreement shall be conducted under the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care shall be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psycho-social needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, X ray, and other special services for VA patients shall be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided shall include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) established in this BOA shall include the cost of medical care, drugs, laboratory, x ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted.
 
   B.2. Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living, to the maximum extent possible.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
 
   B.3. Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and shall be obtained within 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
   B.4. If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility shall arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days shall be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but shall not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility shall include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
 
   B.5. the VA facility shall approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions shall be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
 
   B.6. Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
  
 B.7.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this BOA dies, the nursing home shall within 48 hours notify the VA office  authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects pending further guidance by VA.
 
   B.8. It is agreed that VA shall have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
 
   B.9. The nursing home shall accept referral of and shall provide all services specified in this BOA for any person determined eligible by the VA Under Secretary for Health or his/her designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting shall not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
 
   B.10. It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA shall provide follow up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back to the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
 
   B.11. All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home shall be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records shall be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records shall be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient that includes at least the following:
 
     B.11.1. Admission identification record.
 
     B.11.2. VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care, or State-approved referral form.
 
     B.11.3. Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician).
 
     B.11.4. Physician orders.
 
     B.11.5. Progress notes.  The physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Fluid Solidifiers. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MP-1201-22_Fluid_Solidifiers are eligible for participation. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Fluid Solidifiers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This RFIAQ is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MP-1201-22_Fluid_Solidifiers. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from DAPA prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is December 2013. Among vendors who are on the QSL MP-1201-22_Fluid_Solidifiers, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Fluid Solidifiers.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Fluid Solidifiers. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $415,559.85 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL MP-1201-22_Fluid_Solidifiers who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this RFIAQ via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Pacific via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet.</strong> A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO Pacific POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing, per the IA FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br />Fluid Solidifiers pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full by the response date of this RFIAQ. <strong>Vendors not currently on the QSL for Fluid Solidifiers will not be considered for an IA. Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the QSL FBO MP-1201-22_Fluid_Solidifiers.</strong> Vendor must provide responses to the RFIAQ via the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</p>
<p>1. Vendor must provide pricing for the following items listed in response to the SA FBO posting. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price. Vendors are required to supply pricing for all items listed in the table below, as qualified on the QSL.</p>
<p>Item Descriptions / Annual Usage in Units <br />2000 - 2500 ML BOTTLE FLUID SOLIDIFIERS / 60129<br />3000 ML BOTTLE FLUID SOLIDIFIERS / 53922<br />1500 ML BOTTLE FLUID SOLIDIFIERS / 39001<br />500 ML POUCH OR BOTTLE FLUID SOLIDIFIERS / 12036<br />1000 - 1200ML POUCH OR BOTTLE FLUID SOLIDIFIERS / 11585</p>
<p>2. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the SA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Requisition Number W81EWF23356521A is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. This requirement is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses under NAICS Code 541620 with size standard not exceeding 7 million dollars. <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199 requires all labor and expertise to conduct research into testing for the evaluation of an advanced oxidation alternative to the current biological groundwater containment treatment system and a cost effective in-situ smoldering thermal treatment system technology to destroy contaminants in place. <br>   <br> Specific tasks are listed below:  <br>  <br> CLIN 0001: Pilot Remediation Technologies to be evaluated at the Zephyr site for Environmental Processes Remediation. (Evaluating a mobile advanced oxidation system that can be connected to the current plumbing on-site.)  <br>  <br> Evaluate mobile advanced oxidation process (AOP) unit for pilot testing at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI capable of replacing current biological treatment system.  The unit must be multi-use technology with the specific combination of AOP/cavitation/electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents.  The unit must be capable of a flow through range of 400-3400 gallons per minute. The unit should be mobile, self-powered with no reject or waste stream outside the return or effluent stream.  The unit should be capable of limited to no off-gas of breakdown constituents including ozone.  The unit should be capable of online operation within 24-48 hours of mobilization to the site. The unit must be capable of degrading both chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons including both gasoline and fuel oil #1 from site groundwater. Evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment by an accredited laboratory using EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs), EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs), EPA SW 846 Method 6020 metals analysis, Total dissolved solids (TDS), and Dissolved Oxygen. The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the pilot scale evaluation. The contractor must supply the mobile oxidation treatment system to include all transportation costs, all labor and material to connect to the current system, operator labor, sample labor, sample vials and all analytical cost. The contractor must also return the onsite system to its previous operational condition/state after evaluation. No change orders that include additional cost to this evaluation/SOW will be accepted. Contractor must coordinate site treatment operation with both ERDC and MDEQ so the proper oversight can be scheduled and conducted. (Must be a complete turnaround package.)  <br>  <br> The unit will treat the contaminated groundwater. ERDC will observe the system operation and make sure that the contractor takes samples taken from both inlet and outlet of the system labeled, cataloged properly on a chain of custody form then shipped in appropriate container(s) to an approved laboratory for analysis. The sampling, cataloging, chain of custody, etc. criteria are specifically stated within each EPA Methods listed. <br>  <br> The contaminants in the groundwater to be treated by the mobile treatment unit are Oil Range Organics (ORO), Diesel Range Organics (DRO), and Gasoline Range Organics (GRO) Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) compounds.  The contaminant concentrations pumped from the recovery wells/system may range from hundreds of parts per billion to thousands of parts per billion of total BTEX.  The actual contaminant concentrations are unknown and believed to exist in mostly free phase but non-aqueous phase liquids may be present.   <br> There are no documents or background reports available and no previous pilot studies have been conducted on site. No raw water or influent analytical data results are available. There are no site maps, piping, system schematics, or Process & Instrument Diagram (P&ID) diagrams available of the current treatment system.  <br>  <br> The specific combination of AOP treatments must include cavitation and electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents. The pilot study should be conducted within a sufficient time frame to determine whether this system is appropriate for the site and should meet MDEQ requirements for discharge and will be evaluated for cost per gallon treated and efficiency. The duration of the mobile unit test should be less than 1 week. All electrical power must provided by the mobile unit. A site walk is not planned. The award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0001 $__________ <br>  <br> CLIN 0002: Bench scale testing of a self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment technology using a site soil sample containing free product (gasoline and fuel oil #1) from the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI. The test will have to demonstrate exothermic oxidation of the target contaminants in the sample tested under a process that is self-sustaining without continuous external energy input after initial ignition. The test should demonstrate engineering control of the self-sustaining smoldering process and also the ability to terminate the process under controlled measures.  The contractor's offer must demonstrate that the testing apparatus and supporting infrastructure as well as the expertise to perform the testing has been secured.  Bench scale evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment equivalent to EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) and EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs). The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the bench scale testing. <br>  <br> Self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment uses smoldering combustion to destroy contaminants.  The goal of the self sustained smoldering bench test is to determine if this treatment technology is applicable to this site. The most concentrated contaminants remaining in the subsurface are believed to be in either sand, silt and silty sand at a depth between 25 - 35 ft below ground surface (bgs). The contaminants could be shallower or deeper. The volume of contaminants are assumed over 1,000,000 gallons in the form of DRO, GRO, ORO in concentrations range from non detect to over 100,000,000 ug/kg. The distribution of free phase and non-aqueous phase liquids is not known. There is no map available Soil contaminants sample cores must be extracted by drilling only no excavator can be used. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0002 $______________ <br>  <br> Option CLIN 0003: Successful treatment of bench-scale smoldering testing will lead to a pilot scale evaluation at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI if funds are available.  <br>  <br> There is no in-situ designed approach at this time, therefore the Pilot treatment is undefined. <br>  <br> Total cost CLIN 0003 $_______________ <br>  <br> Parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, on the items quoted including, but not limited to, technical brochures, specification sheets indicating technical ability, pictures, etc. sufficient to determine capability in providing the same or similar product.   <br>  <br> Price shall include any shipping, FOB Destination.  <br>  <br> FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 48HRS PRIOR TO CLOSING. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in caseswhere enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 4:   <br>    The purpose of this amendment is to further clarify the requirement. The suspense date for responses has not changed (27 Oct 2013). <br>   The customer will be testing the engine only. The dynamometer, as stated in Amendment 3, must have its own support systems (i.e.- exhaust, cooling, and fuel). The endstate for the setup is that the customer will simply install an engine into the dynamometer and run the engine under load for two hours. The previous testing requirement has been reduced from five hours to two hours.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Requisition Number W81EWF23356521A is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. This requirement is for full and open competition under NAICS Code 541620.  <br>    <br>  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199 requires all labor and expertise to conduct research into testing for the evaluation of an advanced oxidation alternative to the current biological groundwater containment treatment system and a cost effective in-situ smoldering thermal treatment system technology to destroy contaminants in place.  <br>     <br>  Specific tasks are listed below:   <br>    <br>  CLIN 0001: Pilot Remediation Technologies to be evaluated at the Zephyr site for Environmental Processes Remediation. (Evaluating a mobile advanced oxidation system that can be connected to the current plumbing on-site.)   <br>    <br>  Evaluate mobile advanced oxidation process (AOP) unit for pilot testing at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI capable of replacing current biological treatment system.  The unit must be multi-use technology with the specific combination of AOP/cavitation/electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents.  The unit must be capable of a flow through range of 400-3400 gallons per minute. The unit should be mobile, self-powered with no reject or waste stream outside the return or effluent stream.  The unit should be capable of limited to no off-gas of breakdown constituents including ozone.  The unit should be capable of online operation within 24-48 hours of mobilization to the site. The unit must be capable of degrading both chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons including both gasoline and fuel oil #1 from site groundwater. Evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment by an accredited laboratory using EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs), EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs), EPA SW 846 Method 6020 metals analysis, Total dissolved solids (TDS), and Dissolved Oxygen. The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the pilot scale evaluation. The contractor must supply the mobile oxidation treatment system to include all transportation costs, all labor and material to connect to the current system, operator labor, sample labor, sample vials and all analytical cost. The contractor must also return the onsite system to its previous operational condition/state after evaluation. No change orders that include additional cost to this evaluation/SOW will be accepted. Contractor must coordinate site treatment operation with both ERDC and MDEQ so the proper oversight can be scheduled and conducted. (Must be a complete turnaround package.)   <br>    <br>  The unit will treat the contaminated groundwater. ERDC will observe the system operation and make sure that the contractor takes samples taken from both inlet and outlet of the system labeled, cataloged properly on a chain of custody form then shipped in appropriate container(s) to an approved laboratory for analysis. The sampling, cataloging, chain of custody, etc. criteria are specifically stated within each EPA Methods listed.  <br>    <br>  The contaminants in the groundwater to be treated by the mobile treatment unit are Oil Range Organics (ORO), Diesel Range Organics (DRO), and Gasoline Range Organics (GRO) Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) compounds.  The contaminant concentrations pumped from the recovery wells/system may range from hundreds of parts per billion to thousands of parts per billion of total BTEX.  The actual contaminant concentrations are unknown and believed to exist in mostly free phase but non-aqueous phase liquids may be present.    <br>  There are no documents or background reports available and no previous pilot studies have been conducted on site. No raw water or influent analytical data results are available. There are no site maps, piping, system schematics, or Process & Instrument Diagram (P&ID) diagrams available of the current treatment system.   <br>    <br>  The specific combination of AOP treatments must include cavitation and electrochemical destruction of targeted constituents. The pilot study should be conducted within a sufficient time frame to determine whether this system is appropriate for the site and should meet MDEQ requirements for discharge and will be evaluated for cost per gallon treated and efficiency. The duration of the mobile unit test should be less than 1 week. All electrical power must provided by the mobile unit. A site walk is not planned. The award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable.  <br>    <br>  Total cost CLIN 0001 $__________  <br>    <br>  CLIN 0002: Bench scale testing of a self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment technology using a site soil sample containing free product (gasoline and fuel oil #1) from the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI. The test will have to demonstrate exothermic oxidation of the target contaminants in the sample tested under a process that is self-sustaining without continuous external energy input after initial ignition. The test should demonstrate engineering control of the self-sustaining smoldering process and also the ability to terminate the process under controlled measures.  The contractor's offer must demonstrate that the testing apparatus and supporting infrastructure as well as the expertise to perform the testing has been secured.  Bench scale evaluation must include analytical verification of treatment equivalent to EPA SW 846 Method 8015 Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) and EPA SW 846 Method 8260 Volatile Organic Carbon (VOCs). The contractor will submit a report documenting the results of the bench scale testing.  <br>    <br>  Self-sustained smoldering thermal treatment uses smoldering combustion to destroy contaminants.  The goal of the self sustained smoldering bench test is to determine if this treatment technology is applicable to this site. The most concentrated contaminants remaining in the subsurface are believed to be in either sand, silt and silty sand at a depth between 25 - 35 ft below ground surface (bgs). The contaminants could be shallower or deeper. The volume of contaminants are assumed over 1,000,000 gallons in the form of DRO, GRO, ORO in concentrations range from non detect to over 100,000,000 ug/kg. The distribution of free phase and non-aqueous phase liquids is not known. There is no map available Soil contaminants sample cores must be extracted by drilling only no excavator can be used.  <br>    <br>  Total cost CLIN 0002 $______________  <br>    <br>  Option CLIN 0003: Successful treatment of bench-scale smoldering testing will lead to a pilot scale evaluation at the Zephyr Refinery Site, Muskegon, MI if funds are available.   <br>    <br>  There is no in-situ designed approach at this time, therefore the Pilot treatment is undefined.  <br>    <br>  Total cost CLIN 0003 $_______________  <br>    <br>  Parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, on the items quoted including, but not limited to, technical brochures, specification sheets indicating technical ability, pictures, etc. sufficient to determine capability in providing the same or similar product.    <br>    <br>  Price shall include any shipping, FOB Destination.   <br>    <br>  FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Offerors shall submit technical data on the items quoted.   <br>    <br>  FAR Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose quote is determined to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.   <br>    <br>  FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.   <br>    <br>  FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.   <br>    <br>  Supplement to FAR 52.212-5: The following FAR clauses are applicable to this acquisition: 52.222-3, 52.219-6, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.222- 37, 52.225-13 and 52.232-33.   <br>    <br>  FAR Clause 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (Jan 2011) Supplement to FAR 252.212-7001: The following FAR clauses are applicable to this acquisition: 252.225-7001, 252.232-7003.   <br>    <br>  Quotes are due 29 July 2013 by 5:00PM (Central Time Zone): Quotes will be accepted by email only to: Amanda.Andrews@usace.army.mil.

Therefore, the answer to question #13 is hereby ammended to read as follows: A facility clearance is required to preform on this contract.

<p>Please see Attachment 1 Table 1 Section &lsquo;Ports' for updated specifications.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers: <br />Question: Can the 4 hour minimum battery life requirement be achieved through multiple removable batteries? <br />Answer: No</p>
<p>Question: Will the user need constant power while unplugged?<br />Answer: Yes</p>
<p>Question: Can the system be shut down to replace the battery?<br />Answer: Yes</p>
<p>Question: When in use, will the user be constantly stressing the system or will there be mixed use between idle and stress?<br />Answer: Mixed</p>
<p>Question: Does the Expresscard port need to be a dedicated slot?<br />Answer: No. It can be a combination slot.</p>
<p>Question: Can a PCMCIA to Expresscard 34 adapter be used?<br />Answer: Perhaps. Vendors are asked to offer alternatives/recommendations to the baseline specification as indicated in the instructions.</p>
<p>Question: To confirm, the PCMCIA and Expresscard ports must be integrated into the system (no external USB adapters)?<br />Answer: The Government has a strong desire to minimize the number of external devices/adapters/connections required for the system. vendors should make every attempt to include all required ports within the computer chassis. Excess peripherals/adapters reduce the effectiveness of using laptops to minimize footprint and they exacerbate conneciton/disconnection problems for when the users need to be mobile in their planning efforts. Vendors may offer docking stations with or without external monitors as part of their recommended solution, especially as it relates to providing of all desired external ports required.</p>
<p>Question: Can a USB adapter be used or will a dedicated port be necessary?<br />Answer: The Government has a strong desire to minimize the number of external devices/adapters/connections required for the system. Vendors should make every attempt to include all required ports within the computer chassis. Excess peripherals/adapters reduce the effectiveness of using laptops to minimize footprint and they exacerbate connection/disconnection problems for when the users need to be mobile in their planning efforts.</p>
<p>Vendors are asked to offer alternatives/recommendations to the baseline specification as indicated in the instructions.</p>
<p>Question: NAVAIR is requesting a PCMCIA &amp; ExpressCard slots. Noted already PCMCIA is older technology soon to be obsolete. Will NAVAIR consider combining the slots into one and using an expresscard adapter conversion to achieve PCMCIA card reader?<br />Answer: Although the Government has identified and procured USB-connectable PC Card readers, a single PC Card Slot remains the minimum acceptable for the computer chassis itself.</p>
<p>Question: NAVAIR is requesting RS-232 Serial Port and eSATA Port. These are older standards. Will NAVAIR change the requirement to exist on a docking station instead of laptop? Alternatively, would adapters be accepted?<br />Answer: The Government has a strong desire to minimize the number of external devices/adapters/connections required for the system. vendors should make every attempt to include all required ports within the computer chassis. Excess peripherals/adapters reduce the effectiveness of using laptops to minimize footprint and they exacerbate conneciton/disconnection problems for when the users need to be mobile in their planning efforts. Vendors may offer docking stations with or without external monitors as part of their recommended solution, especially as it relates to providing of all desired external ports required.</p>
<p>Question: Requirement is for SATA 3 SDD. Reviewing with NIST, will NAVAIR change requirement to include a non-SSD SATA 2 FIPS 140-2 hard drive in addition to the FIPS 140-2 SATA 3 SSD?<br />Answer: Systems offered must include drives that fulfill FIPS140-2 compliance requirement. Combination of drives (SSD and non-SSD) are acceptable and one of those drives may be SATA 2. NAVAIR's minimum drive capacity is 256GB. Preference is to obtain the fastest drives possible.</p>
<p>Question: NAVAIR is requesting (2) PCMCIA &amp; (1) ExpressCard Slots. As noted, PCMCIA is older standard. Will NAVAIR change requirement to reduced (2) PCMCIA slots to (1) utilizing the ExpressCard solt with a PCMCIA adapter option?<br />Answer: The Government has a strong desire to minimize the number of external devices/adapters/connections required for the system. vendors should make every attempt to include all required ports within the computer chassis. Excess peripherals/adapters reduce the effectiveness of using laptops to minimize footprint and they exacerbate conneciton/disconnection problems for when the users need to be mobile in their planning efforts.</p>
<p>Question: NAVAIR requirement is for (1) FireWre 800 (IEEE 1394b) Port. Will NAVAIR change requirement to include new ThunderBolt port technology which is 4x faster and price efficient?<br />Answer: NAVAIR has data load devices for some aircraft platforms that require FireWire 800 (IEEE 1394b). If vendors offer a suitable Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 (IEEE 1394b) adapter, it will be considered</p>
<p>Question: NAVAIR is requesting RS-232 Serial Port and eSATA Port. These are older standards. Will NAVAIR change the requirement to exist on a docking station instead of laptop?<br />Answer: The Government has a strong desire to minimize the number of external devices/adapters/connections required for the system. vendors should make every attempt to include all required ports within the computer chassis. Excess peripherals/adapters reduce the effectiveness of using laptops to minimize footprint and they exacerbate conneciton/disconnection problems for when the users need to be mobile in their planning efforts.</p>
<p>Question: Requirement for HDMI. Will NAVAIR modify HDMI requirement to include DisplayPort to HDMI adapters from laptop or docking station?<br />What model(s) of HDMI devices will be connected to the notebook?<br />Answer: Exact device models for this connection are undetermined at this time. Shipboard large screen displays and video-distribution systems are the most likely connected devices for this port. If vendors offer a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and/or or a similar transition capability via a docking station, it will be considered.</p>
<p>Question: CF Card requirement is older standard. Will NAVAIR change requirement for external CF Card slot solution.<br />Answer: The Government has a strong desire to minimize the number of external devices/adapters/connections required for the system. vendors should make every attempt to include all required ports within the computer chassis. Excess peripherals/adapters reduce the effectiveness of using laptops to minimize footprint and they exacerbate conneciton/disconnection problems for when the users need to be mobile in their planning efforts.</p>
<p>Question: Are any newer technologies being ultilized by NAVAIR such as SD UHS-II Flash Media slot with support for next generation SD (Secure Digital, and backward compatible to SDHC &amp; SDXC?<br />Answer: Not currently.</p>

Modification 0004, posted on 29 July 2013 stated that the Government anticipated providing "Notification Letters" for Phase 1 approximately late 4th quarter of FY13.<br /><br />Due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the Government's control, the evaluation of Phase I White Papers has been delayed. The Contract Directorates Office of NAVSEA and the NAVSEA Program Office associated with this BAA have been displaced from Building 197 at the Washington Navy Yard due to the tragic events occurring on 16 September 2013. No definitive date for providing Notification Letters has been determined at this time. The Government will update FEDBIZOPPS as necessary in order to keep those involved informed.

<DESC>**********UPDATE: The NEW SOLICITATION NUMBER for the TIEDS effort is W900KK-14-R-0014. Please disregard previous Solicitation Numbers posted regarding the TIEDS effort. A pre-solicitation notice with the updated number will be posted to the FedBizOpps website.***********  <br>  <br> The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information and solicit industry comment prior to issuing a competitive solicitation for the TIEDS effort. <br>  <br> Brief Summary: The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) is performing market research to identify interested sources for a potential new contract for numerous efforts to support the objectives of IMO and its customers, including, but not limited to Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), other Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Project Management Offices (PMOs), Defense Laboratories, and other Defense Services and Agencies. IMO activities focus primarily on areas that would utilize a Services type contract vehicle, with the added ability to deliver instrumentation related hardware, software or integrated solutions. <br>  <br> Program Description: PM ITTS IMO requires a contract to address the acquisition life cycle of instrumentation related capabilities. TIEDS is geared towards the full spectrum of the instrumentation requirement, research, development, production, integration, and sustainment processes. TIEDS is expected to allow PM ITTS IMO to respond to evolving technology and military demands. The spectrum of services required range from requirements analysis and concept exploration to rapid prototyping, system development, system sustainment and other related tasks. A draft Statement of Work is included to help describe the requirements of this effort. <br>  <br> Acquisition Strategy: It is the Government's intent that the TIEDS program will be executed as a competitive award, and focused to the greatest extent on utilizing Small Businesses. The contract vehicle type has not been determined; however, the Government is contemplating a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract. <br>  <br> Request For Information (RFI): Interested parties are requested to review the draft Statement of Work and provide your written responses by 12:00 PM EST on December 17, 2012. The Government is requesting specific responses to the information provided below: <br>  <br> Administrative: <br> a. Provide company name, points of contact with phone number, and e-mail.  <br> b. Every page should have the company name, header, page numbers, date and if applicable the version number. <br> c. Technical: It is expected that the new TIEDS effort will fund Program Management functions through each individual Task Order and will not fund a separate Program Management Task Order. <br>  <br> i. Describe your approach to support Task Orders, sometimes with evolving requirements, as they arise. Include your process and approach to provide rough order of magnitude (ROM) on cost, schedule, and performance with expedient turnaround times. Include relevant technical history that demonstrates your technical skill sets from work completed. <br>  <br> ii. Describe your ability to operate in an Integrated Product Team (IPT) environment with the Government and/or its customer(s) to meet very short timelines to make decisions, meet documentation and programmatic suspenses, and execute acquisition tasks such as the ones listed below. <br>  <br> iii. Describe how you would manage an ID/IQ contract whereby all program management tasks are funded by individual Task Orders. There could be instances when a significant surge of program management efforts (proposal preparation, IPT coordination, etc.) is required. These surges could be random and without notice, yet require a quick turnaround (i.e. 4th quarter of the fiscal year). Identify your process for staffing and processing multiple proposals, while still managing current efforts. Describe your ability to surge to meet demands. <br>  <br> iv. Describe your approach to a Task Order that is complex (i.e.,  quote mark research, propose, and price the development and life cycle sustainment of a cyber attack instrumentation system quote mark ) and program management intensive versus a simple order that would be a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) procurement (i.e.,  quote mark Purchase 15 qty item #123 radios from the lowest cost of three competing vendors quote mark ).  <br> a. Describe the differences regarding managing a simple verse complex task order. <br> b. Differentiate your approach between the more complex tasks versus the simpler tasks, and discuss how you determine whether to perform the tasks  quote mark in-house quote mark  or via a subcontract. <br> c. Describe previous technical tasks that you have successfully completed that fit into a complex and simple category. <br>  <br> v. Describe your past performance with regard to lifecycle tasks associated with Test Instrumentation and related technologies including test data collection, reduction and analysis; real time casualty assessment (RTCA); and test design, planning, control, infrastructure, networks, and architecture. <br>  <br> Vendors interested in this opportunity are requested to email their response no later than 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 17, 2012 to: <br> Contract Specialist Mr. Jason Malak (jason.malak@us.army.mil) <br>  <br> Contractors are requested to provide a white paper not exceeding ten (10) pages double spaced, single sided, including the cover sheet.

<DESC>This is a modification to the pre-solicitation notice posted on 29 August 2013.   <br>  <br> This a Request for Proposal (RFP)/Solicitation to provide healthcare housekeeping services in support of General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital (GLWACH),and multiple medical treatment facilities (MTF) in the health service area of GLWACH, Fort Leonard Wood, MO.  This acquisition is solicited as an 8(a) set-aside under other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.204(a). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this solicitation is 561720. This solicitation will be awarded using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation criteria. The agency proposes to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders for healthcare housekeeping services will be issued. An IDIQ contract is the optimum contract type for this effort as an exact quantity and/or appropriate categorization of services (Type Ill, IV, V, etc.) cannot be determined on a MTF-specific, individual room basis at the time of contract award.  The resultant FFP task orders issued against the IDIQ will clearly describe GLWACH MTF-specific healthcare housekeeping requirements and services to be performed and provide for prices that will not be subject to any adjustment on the basis of the 8(a) contractor's cost experience in performing this contract. All services shall be firm-fixed price and subject to the Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. 351). The solicitation and subsequent contract will include contract line items (CLINS) with five-year ordering periods.  The anticipated IDIQ contract will obligate the government to the minimum guarantee of $1,500.00 for post-award conference. The entire amount of the minimum guarantee will be obligated against FY 14 funds.  Further obligations will arise as task orders are awarded and obligations will be charged to the fiscal year in which the order is placed.  Healthcare housekeeping services are required for 60 months starting 1 Sep 2014 through 31 Aug 2019.  All elements of the RFP shall be submitted by the Offeror with a proposal no later than the date/time shown in block 8 of the Standard Form (SF) 1449, Solicitation/Contract Order for Commercial Items. Services include healthcare housekeeping services; collection of regulated medical waste (RMW); and collection and distribution of linen.   The square feet (SF) for cleaning of each MTF is varied; however, the estimated SF for GLWACH MTF, and the collective MTFs located in the health service area of GLWACH MTF, currently receiving services under the existing contract is 406,408 SF.   <br>  <br> This solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The official access point to the solicitation is via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi.   The primary point of contact for this project is Ms. Viola Muniz, Contract Specialist, (210) 221-5722; email viola.muniz.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC><p>Enhanced Solutions for the Information Technology Enterprise (E-SITE)</p>
<p>This DRAFT RFP HHM402-14-R-0002 is published in accordance with FAR 15.202. The proposed contract type is Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for various professional IT services with TS/SCI cleared personnel. This notice constitutes a DRAFT solicitation, identified as HHM402-14-R-0002. Comments and questions are being requested at this time. A final RFP is scheduled to be posted in January 2014. The North American Industry Classification Code is 541519. It is the responsibility of the prospective contractors to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.</p>
<p>The E-SITE contract will provide worldwide coverage for IT requirements and technical support services supporting the Government through system design, development, fielding, and sustainment of global intelligence and command and control (C2) assets vital to the security of the United States. The government anticipates multiple contract awards to both large and small business concerns. The ordering period of the multiple awards is anticipated to be for a base and four option years. The overall E-SITE Program ceiling is anticipated to be $6.0B.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of the E-SITE contract is to satisfy the information technology (IT) requirements for the Department of Defense (DoD) Intelligence Community, and would allow for external ordering of IT by other other Intelligence Community Partners.

Therefore, the VACA encourages, where appropriate, the teaming of contractors and vendors.</p>
<p><br />Although this solicitation is unrestricted, in order to be considered compliant with this solicitation, large business offerors shall include small businesses as team members, to include partnerships and mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; arrangements. Small business goals will also be reportable on an annual basis to ensure goals are being met. Past Performance will reflect the primes' capability to meet goals and provide real opportunities for their small business partners. Small business prime awards are envisioned as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR Parts 15 and 16.5, VACA anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to support the E-SITE requirement. The Government intends to make multiple awards resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offers, conforming to the solicitation, will be the best value to the Government.</p>
<p><strong><br /><br />The E-SITE Industry Day is re-scheduled for 30 October 2013. Please see the attached 'E-SITE Industry Day Instructions for 30 October 2013' for details regarding the re-scheduled E-SITE Industry Day and the updated registration process.<br /></strong><br /><br />QUESTIONS: All questions&nbsp;must be submitted IN WRITING to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Esther.Woods@dodiis.mil">E-SITE@dodiis.mil</a>. Phone calls will not be accepted.</p>
<p><br />Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to the award of any contract. You may register at www.sam.gov</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for knowledge of and compliance with all applicable federal information technology and information management laws, regulations, policies and standards at the government-wide level. These can be primarily found at or through the Federal CIO Council website at: http://www.cio.gov.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	 Contracting Activity:  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,  Network Contracting Activity 18, located at 1501 San Pedro DR SE, Albuquerque, NM 87108 proposes to enter into a contract with Virtual Radiologic (Vrad)  located 11995 Singletree LN, Suite 500, Eden Prairie, MN 55344, on the basis of justification for other than full and open competition for the New Mexico Veteran Administration Health Care System (NMVACHS), purchase request  501-14-1-086-0018

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The NMVAHCS has Interim Contract # VA258-13-D-0025 with Vrad that expires on September 30th 2013. To avoid a break in services to eligible veterans' patients, NMVAHCS is requesting a short term contract under FAR 6.302- 1,Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, with the incumbent contractor from 1 October  2013 to 31 December 2013.  Currently, the long term procurement VA258-13-R-1064 is in the evaluation of proposals phase. Due to the estimated time of evaluations, pre award reviews, award, and implementation, it is in the best interest of the Government to award a short term contract to the incumbent contractor.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: The NMVAHCS currently provides care for inpatient, outpatient, and mental health services to eligible veterans residing within the NMVHCS area. Awarding the short term contract to the incumbent contractor Vrad will ensure that veteran patients are guaranteed safe, protected, quality, and timely care within the NMHVAHCS area. Failure to award the short term contract will detrimentally affect the eligible veterans from receiving care in the NMVAHCS.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c) (2), as implemented by FAR 6.302.2  

	( X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority )   The current Contractor Vrad has provided services to the NMVAHCS for approximately 2.5 years. A new procurement for a base plus, one year option, is being acquired. Currently, the NMVAHCS information resource management requires a minimum of 30 to 60 days to install and set up the required interface to transmit and receive radiologic images for a new contractor. The incumbent contractor Vrad currently has the required interface, access on location, required VA credentials, and is immediately available to provide the required health care services to our Veteran patients. Failure to award the short term contract will detrimentally affect the lives of the eligible veterans to receive care in the NMVAHCS area.


6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  N/A 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated dollar value for the contract action is for $88,113.00.  Teleradiology services have been determined to be commercial in accordance with FAR 2.101; cost or pricing data will not be required.  Pricing techniques are described in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2) and  used to establish price fair and reasonableness. The proposed rates will be the same rate as the previous contract the rates that were determined to be fair and reasonable through competition. The current rate is within the average of proposed rates received for the long term solicitation. The rates are also lower than the current rate charged by National Teleradiology Program. The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on historical price analysis of similar services as well as market research. Both provide evidence of fair and reasonable pricing.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  FAR Part 10 directs that market research be conducted on each acquisition appropriate to the circumstances. A search through various databases identified that no other potential sources that are capable of providing our immediate and compelling need at this time.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  A new contractor for the   short term contract period is not practical since a break in service would not be tolerable. A break in service would create life threatening situations for the eligible veterans that receive care in the NMVAHCS area. Due to the urgency to ensure continuity of services to the Veterans this J and A was done in this format. Future solicitations will follow format outlined by directive 1663. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above.


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The proposed contract is for a unique purchase.  For future purchases, an IDC Requirements Contract shall be established in accordance with FAR Part 16.503 and requirements procured under 38 USC 8153.  A pre-solicitation synopsis will be posted in accordance with FAR 5.201 for the new procurement.  






















12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  

13.	Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304
