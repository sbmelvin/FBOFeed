<DESC>DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 09 should be submitted by 1 Feb 09; FY 10 by 1 Feb 10; FY 11 by 1 Feb 11 and; FY 12 by 1 Feb 12.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 28 Sep 2012, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    


I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Air Force Research Laboratory, in partnership with the Global Cyber Integration Center (GCIC) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies, projects, and experiments focused on developing capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to conduct C2 of cyber assets.  GCIC, a sub organization under Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER), is chartered to conduct Command and Control and cyber innovation, experimentation, and transition.  For the purpose of this BAA, AFRL and GCIC will partner to address emerging cyber concepts, technologies, and experimentation to further enhance cyber C2 for the warfighter. 

Cyber operations can be conducted at any level of war and across the entire spectrum of conflict in support of global and theater objectives.  C2 capabilities need to be designed, developed, and implemented that provide for the ability to monitor, assess, plan, and execute cyber operations.  This BAA focuses on developing cyber concepts, technologies, and an experimentation framework to improve Air Force cyber C2 capabilities and integration of these capabilities with other Air Force and Joint systems.

To frame the intent of this BAA we need to briefly discuss cyberspace.  The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations says, “Cyberspace is a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.”  

For the purpose of this BAA, AFRL will focus on technologies to enable C2 of cyberspace assets and integrating their effects with kinetic operations.  Specific technologies should deliver capabilities that include, but are not limited to Cyber C2 collaboration, interoperability, visualization and integration of friendly orders of battle, course of action development, experimentation, Integrated Task Order production, effects deconfliction, hybrid/joint effects, and assessment.  

We assert that simply porting technologies developed for C2 in the air and space domain may or may not be directly applicable or useful in the cyber domain.  Furthermore, we acknowledge that C2 of non-kinetic assets and the effects they produce and integrating them with kinetic assets/effects is at a formative stage.  With these two concepts in mind, we seek novel and unique approaches to enable C2 in an environment that is not confined by time or distance and an area of responsibility that is not constrained by geographical boundaries.


II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $20M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 09 - $5M; FY 10 - $5M; FY 11 - $5M; and FY12 - $5M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 18 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $300,000 to $1,500,000 per year.  There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.


III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  All potential applicants are eligible.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.

2.  COST SHARING OR MATCHING:  Cost sharing is not a requirement.


IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

1.  APPLICATION PACKAGE:  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  WE ARE SOLICITING WHITE PAPERS ONLY.   DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal, see Section VI of this announcement for further details.

2.  CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION:   Offerors are required to submit a 3 to 5 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows:

Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Cost, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax and email)(this section is NOT included in the page count); Section B: Task Objective; Section C: Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b).

All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA 08-09-RIKA with their submission.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.  

3.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 09 by 1 Feb 09; FY 10 by 1 Feb 10; FY 11 by 1 Feb 11 and; FY 12 by 1 Feb 12.   White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 28 Sep 2012, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  

4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.   Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS). 

5.  CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE FOR WHITEPAPER SUBMISSIONS:  AFRL/RISF will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification.  Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only.  Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.  

6.  All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006 as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105.  Defense Security Service (DSS) Site for the NISPOM is: 
https://www.dss.mil/portal/ShowBinary/BEA%20Repository/new_dss_internet//isp/fac_clear/download_nispom.html.  

7.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  

All responses, unclassified/classified, to this announcement must be sent U.S. Postal Service, registered mail and addressed to AFRL/RISF, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA 08-09-RIKA.  Electronic submission is NOT authorized.  Questions can be directed to the cognizant technical POC, Wyatt Bora at wyatt.bora@rl.af.mil or (315) 330-4944.


V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.	CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.  Criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 are equally important and of greater importance than 1.4.

1.1.	Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approaches;

1.2.	The effort’s potential contribution for providing C2 capabilities that meet Air Force cyber requirements within a realistic and reasonable schedule;

1.3.	The prospect for effective transfer of produced technologies into Air Force and joint C2 systems; and

1.4.	The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). 

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a.) assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b.) accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c.) handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.


VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RISF will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET, or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to classified information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  


VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

Wyatt Bora
Telephone:  (315) 330-4944
Email: wyatt.bora@rl.af.mil

In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA.  The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:

Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&amp;D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2008.3, which will be publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Jul 28, 2008. The 2008.3 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on Aug 25, 2008 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, Sep 24, 2008. NOTE: Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).

Six DoD components will participate in the 2008.3 solicitation - the Department of the Air Force, Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The solicitation lists all the R&amp;D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal. Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $100,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept. If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept. Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at &lsquo;http://www.dodsbir.net/submission' following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying. Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (DVBID), hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to SP Industries, Inc. manufacturers of VirTis; Quantity 1 - AdVantage Plus Freeze Dyer EL, 1 - Stoppering Configuration, <br />1 - Leybold 2.5E vacuum pump, 1 - Oil Mist Eliminator for vacuum pump, 1 - Wizard automated control system, 1 - triclover for HVP installation &amp; 3 - Removalable bottom stainless tray for use with AdVantage Freeze Dryer.
<p>In order to ensure the safety of the laboratory environment and laboratory workers during lyophilization of virus samples, the freeze dryer must fit inside of the existing biosafety cabinet (28" deep, 25" wide and 30" high; the entire condenser and stoppering system must weigh less than 400 pounds).</p>
<p>This laboratory produces a large amount of reference reagents and the process of freeze drying these reagents for shipment requires that the freeze dryer include a stoppering tray system (not just side portals) for bulk drying.</p>
<p>Safety and additional cost constraints require the Freeze Dryer to be able to incorporate into the existing Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP) sterilization system which is the most effective process and is the superior system in terms of safety (since it does not use flammable gases).</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to SP Industries (VirTis), under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written product and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward product and pricing information to James Ambrozic, Purchasing Agent, Assistance Field Branch (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email eud7@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all product and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with SP Industries, 815 Route 208, Gardiner, NY 12525 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of extensions of Dell Premier Enterprise Support and Next Day warranties for Dell servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/DO owns and has in use several Dell servers, Dell PowerEdge 6650, Dell PowerEdge 1750, and Dell PowerEdge 2650.  These Dell servers are used to support projects throughout the Washington Metropolitan Area, located at SA-1, Harry S Truman Building, BIMC, and North Glebe Road.  The warranties already have or are about to expire; however, they are still in use and are an essential part to CA/CST/DO.  By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that Dell will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on-site service and parts when necessary. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with Dell servers and the service Dell provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Dell servers.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid<BR><BR>

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/DO requires the purchase of Adobe Acrobat Professional 9.  
Adobe Acrobat Professional 9According to the vendor, Acrobat Professional 9 allows users to PDF (portable document format) documents that comply with a host of industry standards, including PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3, PDF/X-4 (draft), PDF/A, JDF, XMP metadata, and XMLoriginal. PDF documents can also be created from Microsoft Access, Excel, Internet Explorer, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Publisher, Visio, Word, and AutoDesk AutoCAD files. Text, tables, measurements, and embedded object data can be copied from other applications. Paper documents can be scanned to create searchable PDF documents. Layers in applications such as Visio or AutoCAD can be preserved in a PDF document. Headers, footers, watermarks, digital signatures, and access control can be added to any PDF document, and source documents of any format can be attached. Acrobat Professional 9 supports a variety of commenting tools, and both static and dynamic forms. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.            During the CCB evaluation process, it was determined that Adobe Professional 9 offers more integration between its components and with other applications than the previous version of Adobe Professional.It is difficult to impossible  to determine the costs needed to re-design/re-engineer work that is performed on Adobe 9, or earlier versions such as adobe 8 since there is no suitable competitor in the marketplace.CA/CST/DO believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

It is estimated that 192 battery strings will be replaced per year.
It is the FAA's intent to award two contracts to meet this requirement.  It is anticipated that Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contracts will be written to fulfill this requirement.
The results of the market survey will assist the FAA to determine the extent of contracts that may be set-aside for small businesses, Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Small Businesses [8(a)] and Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses.  
The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 335911-Storage Battery Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 500 employees.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agency’s current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases that could participate in the Sentinel Initiative in order to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of two medical products launched within the past several years in at least two different health care databases for: (1) the number of patients identified as using each medical product each month in each health care database throughout the first year after launch; (2) a description of the patients using the product, and characteristics of that use (e.g., product strength, days supply and overall duration of use); (3) the time elapsed before 1 patient, 100 patients, 1000 patients, 10,000 patients and 100,000 patients could be identified in each database using these products; (4) identification of factors that influence the uptake of new medical products in each of the databases examined.  These analyses will be interpreted in the context of the population included and represented by the health care database to determine the generalizability of the findings to the nation as a whole.

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for important characteristics or minimum criteria relating to medical product uptake that could be considered when evaluating health care data systems for inclusion as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.


The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be “Full and Open.”  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is “Best Value.”

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractor’s preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 541690 – Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.


This announcement is not a RFQ.  FDA anticipates release of the RFQ on or around August 9, 2008.  It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page: http://fedbizopps.gov.


The anticipated quotation due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 8, 2008, and September 18, 2008, respectively.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify and evaluate population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products in furtherance of FDA’s Sentinel Initiative.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agency’s current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the content, quality, searchability, and responsiveness of participating data sources and/or data environments. There is a particular need to evaluate the feasibility of these data sources to study blood and tissue products.  Many blood products are administered parenterally in outpatient stand alone clinics or infusion centers, settings that are beyond traditional inpatient hospital-based services.  Because of these and other varied settings of administration (blood centers, inpatient, ambulatory surgery, outpatient prescription, etc.), accurate identification of blood product utilization will require access to data sources beyond traditional prescription or inpatient claims surveys currently available to FDA.  Likewise, useful data sources will require particular capabilities to identify infections and other adverse events in recipients of human tissue products, which may be implanted in inpatient settings, dental offices, or ambulatory surgical settings, and are not usually inventoried in typical inpatient or outpatient pharmacy systems. It is essential that FDA understand the strengths and limitations of potential Sentinel Initiative data sources in studying blood and tissue product safety.  

The primary goals are to evaluate the ability of the potential data sources and/or environments to:

(1)  Evaluate the safety of blood and tissue products.
(a)	Measure blood and tissue product usage including, but not limited to, amounts, frequencies, and indications, as well as demographics and clinical characteristics of recipients.  Enrolled populations should be representative of the US population, and usage should be comprehensive enough to cover the varied clinical indications, care settings (inpatient, outpatient, infusion center, etc.), and product types for blood and tissue products.
(b)	Calculate incidence rates of adverse events by linking blood and tissue uses to subsequent patient healthcare claims.
(c)	Evaluate potential risk factors for developing adverse events.
(d)	Assess if adverse outcomes are attributable to the administered blood or tissue product (e.g., if rates are higher than expected based on analysis of appropriate comparison group)

(2) Accurately identify exposures (procedures involving tissue or blood products) and outcomes (infections and other adverse events of interest) in covered patients, and validate these data.  

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The work requires the identification and evaluation of population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products.

This work will require a thorough analysis of each data source’s: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated blood and tissue products (2) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up, and capture of care across all settings; (4) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for blood and tissue product safety surveillance as well as plans for further data source enhancements; (5) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; and (7) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific evaluations of the feasibility to conduct safety related studies for blood and tissue products in each data source.

The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be “Full and Open.”  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will define and critically evaluate possible database models that should be considered for use in the Sentinel Initiative as it evolves to enhance the performance and findings of the system.  

The awardee will be required to complete the following tasks:

(1.) Develop a comprehensive requirements document detailing actual user needs for monitoring medical product performance throughout its entire life cycle in order to protect and promote the public health. 

(2.) Define possible database models that should be considered for use in the Sentinel Initiative.  This should include, but not be limited to, distributed and federated models.  The list of models to be defined should be developed in consultation with the Agency.

(3.) Compare and contrast the identified database models with the user needs documented in the detailed requirements documents.  Characterize the advantages and disadvantages of the models identified in #2 for the intended use of postmarketing surveillance as envisioned by the Sentinel Initiative.  Evaluate issues related to policy, performance, privacy and security, robustness of findings, benefits to all stakeholders, and data standards.  This requirement should be fulfilled by consulting with all the various stakeholder groups that will be represented in the public-private partnership formed for the implementation of the Sentinel Initiative.    

(4.) Identify and evaluate existing data sources and/or environments that operate under each model.  Describe the content, quality, flexibility, and timeliness of each system, as well as how each could best contribute to the Sentinel Network.


The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be “Full and Open.”  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is “Best Value.”

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractor’s preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 541690 – Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of Biopharmaceutics Classification System Class 3 Drugs for Possible Biowaivers

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) has a requirement for the evaluation of Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class 3 drugs for possible biowaivers.  BCS characterizes drug substances based on their aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability.   
These properties, in addition to dissolution, control the rate and extent of drug absorption from immediate release, solid oral dosage forms.   According to BCS, drug substances may be categorized as follows:  Highly soluble, highly permeable (Class 1); poorly soluble, highly permeable (Class 2); highly soluble, poorly permeable (Class 3); and poorly soluble, poorly permeable (Class 4).  Currently, an FDA guidance published in August, 2000 (BCS guidance), provides for waiver of in vivo bioequivalence studies for drugs determined to have BCS Class 1 properties, provided they are rapidly dissolving and not NTI drugs.  This approach has allowed the approval of numerous new and generic drugs based on in vitro data alone, with tremendous savings in resources and reduction in unnecessary human testing.  It is believed, with the appropriate testing, that biowaivers may be extended to drugs belonging to BCS Class 3.  Such biowaivers could also result in significant savings to the drug industry and the American health care consumer.     

This contract shall evaluate a number of commonly used excipients for possible impact on the permeability and absorption of several BCS Class 3 drugs.  In vitro as well as confirmatory in vivo studies shall be conducted.  The results could support extending biowaivers to drug products in this class.

100% Full and Open Competition

The NAICS code is:  541712.  

It is anticipated that one (1) cost type contract is expected for a one (1) year period of performance. 

The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available through the internet at:  www.fedbizopps.gov .

<DESC>The Center Operations Directorate (COD) at NASA/JSC has a continuing requirementfor offsite office space necessary to accommodate NASA/JSC personnel during therenovation of Building 2 North.  The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry of NASAs intent to extend the currentlease for offsite office space described above to JLW Real Estate for six months. The Governments initial requirement for offsite lease space was competed in March 2007and awarded to JLW Real Estate. The lease was executed to provide the temporary officespace necessary to accommodate NASA/JSC personnel during the renovation of Building 2North. The completion date for the renovation has been extended. Therefore, theGovernments requirement for temporary space continues. Extending the current lease by an additional six months is the most advantageous methodof fulfilling the Governments continuing need. Relocating the existing personnel andestablishing the necessary information technology infrastructure, including securenetwork connectivity, telecommunications and multimedia resources, would result in asignificant duplication of cost to the Government. An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns fromofferors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases ofthis acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality asto the source of the concern.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, thesource selection process, or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore,before consulting with any ombudsman, interested parties must first address theirconcerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer forresolution. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested partiesmay contact the installation ombudsman.Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations, which cannot be resolved at theinstallation, may be referred to the NASA ombudsman.  Please do not contact the ombudsmanto request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technicalrequirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting officer or as specifiedelsewhere in this document.The contact information for the NASA/JSC ombudsman is as follows: Name: Lucy V.

<SUBJECT>Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Microscope
<SOLNBR>NCI-80140-MM
<RESPDATE>080708
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cell and Cancer Biology Branch (CCBB), plans to procure on a sole source basis for a Zeiss LSM 510 META Confocal Microscope with Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood NY 10594.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The CCBB Microinjection and Confocal Microscopy Core Facility was established by the NCI Cell and Cancer Biology Branch in September 1997. The core facility provides state-of-the-art confocal microscopy and digital imaging to CCBB investigators as well as scientists from other laboratories in the NCI to perform high quality clinical and translational research in cancer biology and to train students, residents, and fellows in the field of confocal microscopy.  The core facility also provides services and opportunities for collaborative research to investigators throughout the NCI.

The Zeiss LSM 510 META will replace the existing LSM 510 that is over 11 years old. The new system will have linear unmixing capability that is essential for our users studying stem cell reprogramming. In addition, several researchers using our core facility have requested Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to investigate protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, features of the new microscope such as metatracking, Real-ROI, and DSP scanning control will greatly improve the images that are currently being generated. Capabilities that are currently available on the old system including multitracking and lambda stack acquisition are used routinely by the researchers in the CCR and it is imperative that we continue to offer these capabilities to our users.  The NCI needs to provide over 40 users with “state-of-the-art” confocal imaging for a wide range of applications, including time lapse, 3D, 4D, FRET, and FRAP.  


PART II. Facts and Reasons To Justify Other than Full And Open Competition

1.	Statute: 13.106-1 (b)(2)

(b) Solicitation from a single source.  

(2)	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.


2.	Sole Source Justification

After comparing several confocal systems, it was found that Carl Zeiss offered the best optical resolution and overall performance for our purposes.  The current system lacks the capabilities of the newer systems that are required for the work of the researchers using the CCBB Core Facility as an integral part of their studies. Zeiss shall provide software upgrades and installation at no additional charge.  Due to the large volume of users of the confocal core facility, it is detrimental to ongoing studies to have the current system out of commission for more than a day or two and it is important that the software be kept up to date with the latest macros for imaging techniques.    

The NCI has a need to replace the existing confocal and image processing system to meet the needs of users in their research efforts. The system must provide high resolution; expanded fluorescence capability; speed and ease of use; and quality image capture, processing, and storage capabilities.  

This new confocal system must be compatible with our existing computer systems.  As all of our current equipment is Zeiss, and PC-based, the NCI will be able to network this new system to other computers and printers in the laboratory, thus allowing for easy image transfer and/or printing.  User training and implementation of the new system will be rapid, minimizing any "down time."  And this system can also be upgraded relatively easily and inexpensively in the future to add new capabilities as needed.  The Zeiss LSM 510 META Confocal Microscope will best meet all of our specifications in one integrated system.

<DESC>Appraisals for Properties Enrolled in USDA, NRCS Easement Programs in NH, VT & ME

This is a pre-solicitation notice by the Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, VT State Office, to obtain appraisal services for acquisition of conservation easements on behalf of the United States of America, acting by and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.  The conservation easements will be for wetlands and other conservation practices in accordance with the Wetlands Reserve Program and other Farm Bill programs.  The contractor shall furnish all appraisal services according to USPAP guidelines.

For planning purposes, there are expected to be approximately 30 appraisals to be completed in each contract year.   The solicitation will be divided into zones for proposal and order purposes.  Respondents may offer on any or all zones.  It is estimated that between five (5) and thirty (30) appraisals per year may be needed.  The minimum order guaranteed by the government is one appraisal per contract awarded.  Total delivery orders issued against each contract for all years can not exceed $500,000.  The contractor will also be asked to submit pricing for time-sensitive delivery of services (less than 20 day turn-around) in addition to regular pricing.  

The NRCS intends to award an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) fixed-price contract to a small business source capable of providing real estate appraisals for a base period of one year and four option years for a total of approximately five years. An IDIQ fixes a price for an appraisal, should it be ordered.  There is a guaranteed minimum of one appraisal per contract for the base year and no guaranteed minimum for the option periods.  It is anticipated that more than one contract may be awarded from the solicitation.  

The contractor is responsible for having a current knowledge of the requirements of state law in connection with real estate transactions and appraisals.  Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a state temporary practice permit and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued. Appraisers must demonstrate competency in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type. All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with USPAP and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.

This is 100% set-aside for small-business. The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard is $1.5 million in average annual receipts.

All contractors must register in the Central Contractor’s Registration database at www.ccr.gov. The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at: 1-888-227-2423. The first step to registering is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B). To request a DUNS number, call D&B at the toll free number 1-866-705-5711 or register on-line at http://www.dnb.com/ccr/register.html. Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge. It’s a good idea for anyone who is submitting a proposal to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete. Failure to register by close of business on the third day after notification of possible award by the Contracting Officer, may cause rejection of your offer. Prospective contractors also must complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. (see FAR 4.1102) Prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to ORCA as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.

All prospective contractors will be required to review all documents pertinent to the solicitation.  All offerors that meet the qualifications in the attached Appraisal Specification will be considered for award.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror(s) based on price.  Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are encouraged to offer the most advantageous pricing in their response.  

The solicitation package and all attachments will be posted to this website on or about 15 days from issuance of this notice.  Responses will be due approximately 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.

This radio is brand specific because the Advanced MPCE leverages off the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) MPCE that has been already developed and tested.  Since much of the software from the LCS MPCE will be ported directly into the Advanced MPCE it is essential that the key communications suite be identical so as to ensure 100% compatibility and operability.  Use of any other components or configurations of equipment would result in costly and time consuming testing to certify the items 100% compatible. Size Standard 750 employees

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source cost modification to contract: HHSS270200700004C / Reference Number 270-07-0191 to:

 Chestnut Health Systems, 1003 Martin Luther King Dr, Bloomington, IL 61701

The purpose of this modification is to provide additional funds to the contract to support the increase in the number of grantee sites for Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach/Assertive Continuing Care (ACRA/ACC) from 17 to approximately 35 and the number of grantee sites for Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) from 17 to approximately 147 covered under this contract.  

The AAFT Grant Program requires the use of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) and the Adolescent Community Reinforcement (A-CRA) and Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) clinical protocols.  The Request for Applications for the Grant Program specified that the cost of training, monitoring and certification in the GAIN, ACRA and ACC would be borne by the Federal Government.  Chestnut Health Systems served as the Coordinating Center for the Cannabis Youth Treatment Study in which the GAIN and ACRA were developed and tested.  Chestnut Health Systems also developed the ACC Protocol.  Chestnut Health Systems holds the copyright for the GAIN and is the sole training organization for the GAIN, A-CRA and ACC.  Training, monitoring, coaching and certification require a national center for overseeing these activities that will be from disparate locations throughout the United States and its Territories.  

The training, monitoring, coaching and certification are in the GAIN assessment and follow up instruments; and the A-CRA, and ACC clinical protocols.  The outcomes of this contract will be nationally trained and certified administrators and trainers of GAIN, and nationally trained and certified clinicians and clinical supervisors of A-CRA and ACC.  At the end of the base year and four option year contract period the grantee sites will be equipped to train and certify their own personnel in GAIN, A-CRA and ACC.  Chestnut Health Systems will operate and maintain a data base, updated monthly and forwarded to SAMHSA/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment on the progress and implementation of these tools in their sites.  

The proposed contract action for additional sites is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities received within forty five (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<a href="mailto:rachael.raposa@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-New England District (Corps) is proposing to restore Broad Meadows Marsh, located south of Sea Street and the Broad Meadows School in Quincy, Massachusetts.  The Project involves the removal of approximately 40 of 65 acres of historic fill resulting from the disposal of dredged material within a diked area to restore 35 acres of salt marsh and 5.0 acres of Bordering Vegetated Wetland (BVW).  The remaining 25 acres of fill will be converted to coastal grassland habitat that will also provide passive public recreational uses.  The project is part of a joint effort between the City (the local sponsor for the Project) and the Corps to restore the Broad Meadows Marsh.  The Corps is the lead agency and will be responsible for the construction and construction management of the restored salt marsh and waterfront park.  The proposed construction activities will involve excavation of approximately 6 to 10 feet of former hydraulically dredged material (approximately 390,000 cubic yards) from the southern portion of the former dredge disposal site to achieve a sustainable salt marsh elevation between elevation 1.5 feet and 5 feet NAVD 88.  Elevated walkways will be constructed across portions of the salt marsh and will be connected to a trail network throughout the site.  The southern, excavated area will be graded to elevations to sustain approximately 10 acres of low salt marsh, 0.3 acres of salt pannes, and 20 acres of high salt marsh.  Two main tidal channels will be constructed through the marsh to provide tidal flushing to sustain a salt marsh ecosystem and provide roughly 6 acres of aquatic intertidal habitat.  The constructed channels will be aligned with the former intertidal creeks that existed before the site was filled with dredged materials.  The construction contractor will utilize low pressure heavy construction equipment suitable for salt marsh restoration work to relocate the formerly dredged material on site.  To protect water quality, the existing perimeter berm will be left in place until all of the material behind it is removed. Equipment will be located only in those areas which will need to be disturbed in order to remove portions of the berm for the main channel and to connect the restored channel to the existing channel outside the berm.  If equipment needs to go beyond the area that will be disturbed, then appropriate matting (e.g., timber mats or swamp mats) will be used for any equipment that will be staged on the existing salt marsh. As a layer of natural peat may exist under the diked area to be restored, and a natural seed source exists immediately adjacent to the restored site, the area should re-colonize with native salt marsh communities.  However, to facilitate the colonization of the salt marsh with native vegetation, the new high and low marsh areas will be planted with Spartina patens and Spartina alterniflora, respectively. The estimated cost of this work is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This solicitation is 100% Set-Aside for HUBZone Small Business concerns. The NAICS code for the work is 237990 with a small business size standard of $31 million. The solicitation shall be made available via the Internet (www.fbo.gov) on or about 11 August 2008. Registration instructions are available at this website. Amendments, if any, will be available at this Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for solicitation documents will be accepted. All responsible HUBZone Small Business concerns may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.

<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) located in Bethesda, MD on the National Naval Medical Campus, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Canberra Industries, 800 Research Pkwy Meriden, CT 06450 (017592135), for an Alpha/Beta Spectrometer to be used in USU's Counting Laboratory. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures, as stated in FAR 13.106-1(b). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Statutory Authority: 13.106-1(b)(1)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">(b) Soliciting from a single source.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The sole source determination is based on Canberra Industries being the sole manufacturer and seller of the Alpha/Beta Spectrometer. Currently, the USU Counting Lab has Canberra equipment and the purchase of the Canberra Alpha/Beta Spectrometer will allow the lab to use one central computer to control all devices maximizing lab space, simplify the training of software interface, standardize sample reports, and ensure compatibility between all devices. Puchasing from a different manufacturer would either lead to incompatibilities between the devices on the one computer and/or lead to additional costs. This is the only source known to USUHS which can meet this requirement. This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to <a href="mailto:Timothy.Bunting@usuhs.mil">Timothy.Bunting@usuhs.mil</a>. The expected delivery date is August 8, 2008. </span></p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 66.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

				U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters

                                                                                     Measurement

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV),Indian Head, Maryland is requesting information on advanced control technologiesin order to identify the most promising means of improving remote andteleoperated control of EOD robotic platforms.  A number of different types ofpertinent robot control technologies exist that have not been widely integratedinto existing EOD UGVs.  The scope of this effort is to investigate theirapplicability to EOD robotics and leverage these advancements to bringadditional capabilities to EOD users.  Ideal technologies should facilitateintuitive, teleoperated control of the unmanned platform in differentenvironments, including non-line-of-sight (NLOS) applications.  In addition,these technologies should address the major shortfalls of currently fieldedsystems, including the cognitive burden placed on the remote operator, lack of situational awareness, and a bulky OCU.  Innovative, non-traditionalcontrol technologies are desired that address these issues and are modular,scalable, and able to be integrated onto existing MTRS platforms fordemonstration purposes.  Systems that are in advanced stages of development arepreferred, and an assessment of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) should beincluded in the description.  Performance description is sought in the form ofwhite papers, brochures, specifications sheets, and points of contact. Technicalcontent is limited to five (5) pages. Design proposals requiring developmentalfunding are not of interest at this time.

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation.  The Social Security Administration is performing market research to identify capable GSA vendors to provide 2 Embosser printers for the Braille Services Team at the Social Security Administration (SSA) Headquarters in Baltimore.   The requirement is for an embosser capable of printing large volumes at a continuous high-speed. All interested parties capable of providing this machine are invited to submit information that includes company name, address, contact name, and telephone number, company literature, make, model, part number and description. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.  Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be factored into subsequent procurement set-aside determinations and/or solicitation requirements.  No award will be made based on this synopsis. The information received will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources.   Requests for copies of a solicitation and/or telephone calls WILL NOT be honored or acknowledged.  No cost or pricing data is required or requested. Responses must be submitted by 4:00 p.m. EST on August 6, 2008 to Sandy Wicks, Contract Specialist, Office of Acquisition & Grants, 1st Floor – Rear Entrance

Salient Characteristics for Embosser:

The embosser produces braille documents that are used by visually impaired SSA employees. At least 75% of their workload depends on this equipment to produce braille documents.  The machine that would handle such a workload must have the following specs:

The embosser must be a high speed, high volume machine capable of producing documents at a  minimum 200 character per second, and 600 pages per hour rate for approximately eight (8) hours per day. 

The type of paper that will be used is: blank, continuous, pin-feed tabulating paper that is 12 1/2 inches x 11 inches, with a 1/2 inch perforation on the left and right side of the paper.  The paper also has 19 spiral holes on the left side of the paper. 

The embosser must be easy to load and unload paper for both sighted and visually impaired users. 

The embosser must have one sided and interpoint (two-sided printing of braille documents) printing capability. 

The user (visually impaired personnel) should not have to use a keyboard; instead the embosser must have a Duxbury Braille Translator (software) that automatically sets the configuration for the embosser; which also replaces the vocal accessibility. 

The embosser should have a removable motherboard that can be pulled out and mailed to the vendor/manufacturer for most service repairs. 

The embosser must be able to fit on top of a desk approximately 5 feet in length x 3 feet wide. 

The embosser must have at least a minimum two (2) year warranty that covers all parts for manufacturing defects. 

The embosser must include an on-site maintenance agreement.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:
The Department of Labor (DOL), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, Civil Rights Center (CRC) enforces various Federal statutes and regulations that prohibit discrimination within the Department of Labor. 
The primary activities of the CRC include counseling, mediating, investigating and issuing decisions on discrimination complaints filed against DOL. 
The Center is responsible for ensuring that discrimination complaints are processed fairly, promptly, thoroughly, and in strict compliance with the federal sector Equal Employment Opportunity regulations and/or applicable law, statute, regulation, Executive Order or directive.
Complaints of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) discrimination filed by DOL employees, applicants for employment with the Department of Labor, or DOL contractor employees that qualify as Federal Employees (contingent workers) are covered by Title 29 Code of Federal Regulation (C.F.R.) Part 1614 and any relevant law, statute, regulation, Executive Order and internal personnel procedures and are included within the scope of this Statement of Work.
The CRC also coordinates compliance with the Department of Labor’s internal policy to Prevent and Eliminate Harassing Conduct in the Workplace.  This Policy is intended to assure that the Department of Labor is taking all necessary steps to prevent sexual harassment and other forms of harassing conduct in the workplace and to correct harassing conduct that occurs before it becomes severe or pervasive.
Where the CRC determines that a potential conflict of interest exists, the Chairperson of the Department’s Administrative Review Board (ARB) has the delegated authority and assigned responsibility for providing for all aspects of the administrative processing of discrimination complaints including the assignment of investigators and the issuance of final decisions.  The ARB is governed by the following authorities and shall also subscribe to this Statement of Work.  The purpose of this RFI is to give industry and academia an opportunity to provide information for Investigation Services to obtain Reports of Investigation in conformance with the standards established by the EEOC.  Upon assignment, CRC/ARB will issue a letter of investigative authorization.  Investigators shall compile an investigative report containing sufficient relevant sworn testimony and other documentary evidence to support the rendering of a decision on the merits of the complainant's allegations.  The investigation shall include a thorough review of the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred; the treatment of members of the complainant’s protected group(s) as compared with the treatment of other similarly-situated individuals, if any; and any policies and/or practices that may constitute or appear to constitute discrimination.  At the conclusion of the investigation, the contractor shall provide a Report of Investigation (ROI) to the CRC/ARB.

EEO investigations shall be conducted DOL-wide.  The geographic coverage of this Statement of Work is domestic (covers the 48 contiguous states; Washington, D.C.; Alaska; Hawaii; and Puerto Rico).  Investigators shall coordinate contact with witnesses (excluding the Complainant) and the receipt of documentary evidence through the relevant sub-agency’s EEO Manager.  This individual is an employee of the sub-agency, not of the CRC/ARB.  The CRC/ARB shall provide contact information for these individuals to the Contractor.

If a Complainant fails to cooperate in the prosecution of his/her complaint, the Contractor shall provide documentation to support such a conclusion to the CRC/ARB.  Consistent with the regulatory requirements, the CRC/ARB shall propose and, when appropriate, may recommend dismissing the complaint.  See Terminating or Interrupting the Investigation Prior to Completion, Infra.  The CRC/ARB and the Contractor shall entertain timely requests for extensions if supported by “good cause” reasons for delay.  When an extension has been approved, the Contractor shall obtain from the Complainant an agreement to extend the Investigative Period pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.108(e).  A copy of the fully executed agreement to extend the investigation shall be provided to the COTR by the Contractor prior to submission of the ROI.

In most cases, witnesses shall be requested to produce fully responsive and appropriately executed affidavits (with appropriate corroborating documentary evidence) within fifteen (15) calendar days of their receipt of the request.  (Exercising the option to seek legal advice from the Office of the Solicitor (SOL) does not extend the timeline for submission.  See Management Right of Review, Infra.)  The CRC/ARB and the Contractor shall entertain timely requests for extensions if supported by “good cause” reasons for delay.  If a completed affidavit is not received by the designated Investigator within twenty (20) calendar days of the witness’ receipt of the affidavit request, the Investigator will attempt to inquire on the status of the statement with the witness directly.  The witness will be afforded an additional seven (7) calendar days to make delivery to the Investigator.  If a statement is not received by that time, the Investigator shall inform the EEO Manager via email of the delinquency.  If a statement is not received by the Investigator within seven (7) calendar days from that time, the Contractor shall notify the COTR and the CRC/ARB shall send a memorandum to the agency head.  If this action does not produce the desired result, the investigative record will be closed and the aforementioned attempts to secure a statement shall be documented.  These procedures shall also apply to requests for documentary evidence – often requested from agency Human Resources offices – which should not be sanitized by the agency.

HARASSING CONDUCT INVESTIGATION  

An additional purpose is to obtain reports of investigation for claims of harassing conduct.  Investigations shall be performed to identify and obtain all relevant evidence from all relevant sources and gather sufficient information relevant to the issues in the complaint to determine the validity of the claim(s).  At the conclusion of the investigation, the contractor shall provide a Report of Harassing Conduct Investigation.

Harassing conduct investigations shall be conducted DOL-wide.  The geographic coverage of this Statement of Work is domestic (covers the 48 contiguous states; Washington, D.C.; Alaska; Hawaii; and Puerto Rico).

The use of information received from industry and academia shall be used to complete final solicitation documents at the discretion of CRC.  Eligiblity to participate in future solicitation does not depend on responding to this noice.  The Government will not critique a potential offer's information.  Proprietary information is not being solicited and, if included, should be identified as such.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a brand name procurement under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires the purchase of Encase Forensic Software. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make a firm fixed price award, with options,&nbsp;for Encase Forensic Software. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Friday, 01 August, 2008, 4:00 p.m. EST.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate for only one brand name under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may request or provide information. All information received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br />DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Encase Enterprise Forensic Suite software provides USSOCOM the capability to monitor, investigate, remediate and protect all networks against malicious intrusion, security incidents and cyber attacks. The software allows USSOCOM to meet the following requirements:<br />&bull; rapidly and thoroughly investigate computer incidents occurring on nodes within USSOCOM's networks regardless of location to include unique closed networks and standalone systems<br />&bull; respond to IDS alerts to verify device(s) compromised<br />&bull; identify deviations from system baselines during INFOCON support to verify integrity of critical devices<br />&bull; dramatically reduce time and costs related to investigating and resolving network-wide incident(s) while dramatically increasing the security posture of the information and information systems contained therein<br />&bull; ensure policy compliance on all workstations and servers<br />&bull; proactively and reactively locate and eliminate classified data spillage that has strayed to a network of lower classification<br />&bull; proactively identify and address internal and external network security, information assurance, and counterintelligence threats before they erupt into significant events<br />&bull; locate, analyze, and capture data in a forensically sound fashion from any network-connected node<br />&bull; identify unauthorized active programs running on the network, such as peer-to-peer communications, covert channels, and alternate data streams<br />&bull; coordinate more effectively with criminal and counterintelligence investigators when investigating an incident<br />&bull; Comply more thoroughly and at lower cost with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the resulting NIST interpretation detailed in the Special Publication 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide</p>
<p>The acquisition of the maintenance support for the current key licenses will ensure that USSOCOM continues to have the ability to provide operational forensic analysis and remediation at a level of acceptability required by DISA and DoD directives/mandates. The Encase Enterprise software provides a highly specialized capability not surpassed by any other application available to resolve, isolate and cleanup contaminated areas dealing with security incidents and events of interest at a level and scope required to support USSOCOM's networks. Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued performance of a highly specialized service/software. The Encase Enterprise software allows the analyst/technician the ability to access multiple files/folders across an array of servers storing terabytes of data, in a limited amount of time to isolate data needed to be extracted and cleaned to meet NSA, DIA and DISA standards for proper handling of data spills. No other tool on the market can provide this level of discovery and remediation. The Encase software that is being used is also embedded as a module interface in a DoD/Joint Staff downward directed program which allows the ability to further enhance our current capabilities by also protecting workstations and devices on the network.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through full and open competition. The approximate cost of the duplication effort would be $466,086.00. These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that would be incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for contractors and government employees, if a new system were to be put into place. The cost that would not be recovered through full and open competition involve resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated to downtime and lack of coverage during a replacement phase of new technology.</p>

<p>EMC Documentum Records Manager 5.3 SP4 is a DoD 5015.2 certified software application designed to manage electronic, non-electronic, and e-mail records to include classified records. EMC Documentum 5.3 Records Manager extends Documentum's existing Content Management functionality by adding features and functions specific to records management such as corporate file plans, retention policies (RPS), file- and field-level security along with the ability to manage and declare records. This solution is USSOCOM's chosen DoD compliant Electronic Records Management application which is operated on&nbsp;USSOCOM's internal network and manages&nbsp;all of USSOCOM headquarters and&nbsp;its components official records. In order to continue to operate this system, we need to procure the software license maintenance updates.</p>
<p>In addition, to award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through full and open competition as well as unacceptable delays in filling government requirements. The table below shows costs required to integrate a new system into the current USSOCOM enterprise architecture. This cost estimate is based on initial licensing, license maintenance, consulting services, training, and travel/TDY costs. The cost does include other factors like additional server licenses, lost manpower hours, data migration costs, end user training, and system down-time to the command. Additionally, it would directly affect and negatively impact other systems that are currently being fielded at USSOCOM and require this application:</p>

<p>The above estimate was compiled based on our current electronic records management system configuration and prices are subject to change dependant upon how each vendor packages their licenses. This most certainly would result in USSOCOM having to purchase additional license types in order to field a different electronic records management system.</p>

CBP needs to upgrade the current Keyence digital microscope, a unique product that captures images through a unique technology in a compact design, in that more people can use it in analyzing different commodities at higher magnifications (past 500x) while others use it at lower magnifications.  With this upgrade we will be able to do more measurements at high speed.  We have the unique lens at higher magnification and the products made by different vendors cannot be used with the higher lens because their lenses will not fit the unique design and technology.

<DESC>The Turner Fairbank Highway Research centers intend to purchase on a sole source basis an XRF Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Panalytical Epsilon 5) from Panalytical Instruments. This instrument will be used for the quantitative analysis of aggregates, cement, concrete, fly ash and asphalt for their metal content. Research is directed towards prevention of ASR gels in concrete, increased use of fly ash in concrete and forensic studies for State agencies.  The EDXRF instrument must be capable of precise accurate non destructive analysis of powders, liquids and solids. It should be capable of analyzing elements in the periodic table from Sodium to Uranium. The instrument should be equipped with an X-ray tube capable of providing 100kV and up to 24ma to ensure excitation of heavy element K-lines up to Hf in the periodic table. The total power should not be less than 600W. The instrument must have a polarizing optical path for the reduction of spectral background. The optical path must have the capability of utilizing up to 14 secondary scattering targets for optimization of the detection of key elements in the periodic table. The instrument should be fitted with a high resolution solid state Ge detector capable of a resolution of at least 135 eV @ Mn. The detector should have an energy range of 0.7 to 100KeV, be liquid nitrogen cooled for highest resolution and be fitted with a safety sensor to automatically turn off HT to the detector in case liquid nitrogen levels fall below operating levels. The instrument should be fitted with an integral high capacity sample X-Y changer and have the capability of accommodating up to 52 samples in cups or 133 uncupped samples.  The sample change must have the capability to differentiate between solid and liquid samples to prevent inadvertent loading of liquids samples in a vacuum. The sample change must also be capable of being continually added to during a batch to provide continuous uninterrupted analysis. The software should be windows based and be compatible with modern software platforms. The software should be designed for easy sample analysis and data retrieval and allow for the flexibility of application development by the user. The software should be capable of at least the following capabilities; 1. Be capable of comparing multiple spectra. 2. User control of deconvolution parameters. 3. Blank subtraction capabilities. 4. Full array of matrix correction possibilities including Alphas and Compton correction. 5. Manual and overlap spectral line correction.  Panalytical is the only source known to satisfy the government’s requirements.

The natural gas system being privatized is described as follows: Yeager Air National Guard Base is home to the 130th Airlift Wing, which provides staff and operational support for C-130H aircraft. Yeager ANGB is located a Charleston West Virginia and has a total of 74.8 acres under lease.  Of this total, 43 acres are located on top of the hill on which the airport was built.  Most of this area has been developed.  Any expansion requires relocation of existing buildings to other areas, using vehicle parking areas, or acquiring additional land.  The lower portion of the base has been developed along the access road to the airfield.  This section contains approximately 33 acres.  Development has been on benches made from leveling hilltops or cutting into the side of hills.  The developed area in this lower section covers 9.3 acres.  The remainder is made up of hillsides and ravines which are expensive to develop.  The apron and taxiway at Yeager Airport were built in 1949.  The first facilities built were Building 101-Base Supply, Building 107-Maintenance Hangar, and Building 102-Headquarters in 1951.  The base currently has 31 buildings with a total square footage of 295,051.   The natural gas distribution system at Yeager AGS (ANG) is comprised of approximately 4,300 linear feet of polyethylene and steel pipe ranging from 1.25 to 4 inches in diameter, 17 steel plug valves, 2 PE ball valves, 12 regulators and 1 large meter.  The most common type of system piping is a 50% mix of PE and steel buried approximately 4 feet underground.  Piping and valves are considered to be in good condition with ages ranging from 1951 to present.  The delivered PSIG of the system is 30 PSIG and reduced to a 6 to 8 PSIG for service lines.  The system has no cathodic protection devices and is metered from one location on base.  There are three planned facilities that will require gas service once completed.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2000 and no offers were received.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary has a need to implement education and stewardship programs at the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) in San Francisco and at the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary at Duxbury reef in Marin. This program is for the Education and Stewardship of a larger Duxbury Reef Restoration and Interpretation program. The overarching objective of the Rocky Reef Interpretation and Restoration Program (RRIRP) is to restore Duxbury Reef through research, education and stewardship. This will entail developing a program that will foster interest of the natural history of intertidal life and teach tidepool etiquette to complement the existing research and monitoring program. The ultimate goal is to reduce the effects of trampling and collection of intertidal algae and invertebrates at Duxbury Reef and beyond. If successful, this program will be replicated and used at other sanctuary rocky shore sites along the coast of California.</p>
<p>The environmental education and stewardship component of this program is aimed at increasing public awareness and care of this sensitive habitat. This will be accomplished through the development of a volunteer program that will include natural history, interpretation, fieldwork and an opportunity to be a part of a rocky shore restoration project. Task will include: A) Create a Rocky Shore interpretive training program for volunteers, which will include basic information on the CAS and GFNMS, interpretive techniques, tidepool etiquette, natural history of rocky shore algae and invertebrates. B) Create a field-training program for the outdoor reef volunteers, the Rocky Reef Naturalists. This will include outdoor interpretation and four field sampling tasks: 1) Visitor Counts, 2) abundance and distribution of turban snails, 3) abundance and distribution of Fucus, and 4) Photo Plots. C) Develop a final training manual for Rocky Reef volunteers, GFNMS has a draft manual available for guidance. D) Develop an additional manual for the outdoor reef component that includes maps of the study site, the data entry forms and field sampling protocols. E) Recruit and train the Rocky Reef volunteers, training will include natural history of the species that inhabit the rocky shores, human impacts to the habitat, best tidepool etiquette and how to interpret the rocky shore to school groups and the public. All Rocky Reef volunteers will be required to take this 18-hour basic course. F) Recruit and train the volunteers who elect to participate in the outdoor reef component. This training will include information on the restoration project, monitoring protocols and procedures, how to complete data forms and data entry. This training will be a minimum of six hours. Once completed the volunteers will be known as Rocky Reef Naturalists. G) Purchase equipment relevant to the Rocky Reef Interpretation and Restoration program, such as lap top computer, outdoor reef volunteer field jackets, monitoring supplies, interpretive tools and aids for volunteer use.</p>

A Firm-Fixed Price award will be issued in writing. Telephone bids will not be processed. Brand Name Justification:<br />1. This request is to Purchase 30 Brand Name Star Trac New Spinner NXT Extraordinary Bikes, 7090 Model #9 to support 1FSS Spinning&reg; program. This is a 1 hour indoor cycling cardio program that provides a means for Airmen to get "Fit to Fight". Spinning is a cardio-vascular workout for the whole body utilizing a special stationary bicycle. Spinning is much more than an extraordinary stationary bike. It's a comprehensive training program that works the entire body, inside and out. This is the only known product that will meet the minimum essential needs of this department to support the Spinning&reg; program. 2. The demand placed on the equipment, operating between 60 and 100 RPM at medium to high resistance for an hour each class, requires that we look very closely at life cycle costs, not simply initial price, and choose quality spinning bikes that will operate on a consistent basis with minimal maintenance and good product support. Research shows the STAR TRAC Spinner NXT 7090 bikes have proven to be reliable and requires low maintenance. Various vendors can supply the specified model and brand and competitive bids will be solicited for the requested brand only by synopsizing on Fed BizOpps.3. The Star Trac NXT is the newest technology from Star Trac but based on the proven design of their past bikes. The bike frame has gone to aluminum and an upgraded powder coating - almost rust proof. Other bikes are steel framed. Star Trac has an exclusive10 year contract with Mad Dogg Athletics, which is recognized as the national and international body for spinning certification and continuing education. This makes us eligible to host spinning seminars and workshops which will result in our ability consistently deliver the very best fitness programs to our active duty personnel and their families.4. We will continue to monitor the market for new and improved spinner bikes to avoid requesting a specific brand name when submitting a new requirement. 5. Purchase of the STAR TRAC NXT bikes will make us eligible to host spinning seminars and workshops which will result in our ability to consistently deliver the very best fitness programs to our active duty personnel and their families.

<DESC>The mission of the 95th Mission Support Group, Logistics Readiness Division, is to provide top quality, customer-oriented, Base Supply, Fuels and Logistics Materiel Control Activity (LMCA) services, hereinafter referred to as "supply services", to the civilian (government and contractor) and military workforce of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) and associate units supported via the Interservice/Intergovernmental Support Agreement (ISA) process. The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to provide AFFTC with efficient and effective performance-based supply services by a highly-qualified, fully trained, professional, and dedicated workforce.  To this end, the contractor shall execute established procedures outlined in Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110, Volume 1 through 9 (USAF Supply Manual), Air Force Instruction (AFI) 23-201 (Fuels Management), and Air Force Materiel Command Instruction (AFMCI) 23-201 (LMCA Operation Instruction), in a manner that ensures best use of resources in support of assigned missions.  The contractor must continuously keep abreast of, and implement, all technical changes and upgrades to standard systems in order to ensure mission readiness.  Unless otherwise specified, all chapter references contained in this PWS apply to AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2.  With the exception of the items/services specified as being government-furnished in Section III hereof, the contractor shall provide all resources (labor and materials) to perform the supply services described within this PWS in a manner that meets the objectives stated herein. Under directions from HQ USAF, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is presently exploring the feasibility of centralizing the supply functions of Stock Control, MICAP, Records Maintenance, Equipment Management, and Computer Support from base level to one command-regional center.  Should a final decision be rendered to centralize, any changes to the PWS as a result of centralized functions will be accomplished IAW with contract terms and conditions.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business under the NAICS code identified above.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Data acquisition system for an existing phase-measuring interferometer to be used in the Manufacturing Metrology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

Background 
The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL), Manufacturing Metrology Division (MMD) provides research and measurement services that address U.S. industry needs for traceable metrology of optical figure and wavefront. 

The MMD division requires a data acquisition system consisting of software and hardware for the NIST custom built eXtremely accurate CALIBration Interferometer (XCALIBIR), a multi-configuration phase-shifting interferometer with an aperture of 300 mm for demanding measurements of form and radius of curvature.  The existing interferometer is located in a class 1000 cleanroom at the NIST facility in Gaithersburg MD.  The data acquisition system will be located in a control room next to the cleanroom.  Laser source and driver electronics for phase shifting are located in the control room.

The interferometer can be configured as a Twyman-Green or a Fizeau interferometer.  The switch between the two modes is accomplished through a manual shutter which blocks the Twyman-Green reference arm.  Source and imaging leg are the same for each mode.  Each mode has a dedicated piezo-mechanical phase shifter.  The data acquisition system shall allow for phase shifting measurements in either mode and shall also allow for measurements using wavelength shifting.  The data acquisition system shall have interfaces for the two piezo-mechanical phase shifters of XCALIBIR (one for the Twyman-Green and one for the Fizeau mode) and an additional interface for wavelength shifting.  The software of the data acquisition system shall allow selection of the appropriate interface. 

The imaging arm of the interferometer has a customized Dalsa 1M15 camera (1024 x 1024 pixels, 12 bits, 15 frames/s).  The camera has a digital RS-422 interface. Some camera functions are controlled through an additional RS-232 interface (binning, frame rate, video gain).
 
The phase shifters in the Twyman-Green and Fizeau arm are equipped with amplifier/driver electronics.  The data acquisition system has to provide appropriate analog 0 V to 10 V signals to accomplish a phase shift (one for each configuration). 

The laser of the interferometer is a New Focus TLB-7004 StableWave external cavity diode laser.  The laser vacuum wavelength is centered at 632.9914 nm.  The wavelength can be controlled through an analog voltage or through an RS-232 or GPIB interface.  The maximum cavity length of the XCALIBIR interferometer equals 3 m.

The software of the data acquisition system shall be based on commercially available phase shifting interferometry data acquisition and analysis software, and shall allow for data acquisition, data analysis, and data import/export.  The software shall have a scripting language to program a measurement sequence.  The scripting language and software shall have the capability to respond to an external trigger from a control computer via a serial interface or network. 

A SITE VISIT shall take place on Monday, August 18, 2008 promptly at 1:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST).

Attendees shall convene at NIST, in the Sound Conference Room, Building 233 at 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

The site visit shall allow Offerors to view the XCALIBIR facility.  Potential Offerors are strongly encouraged to attend site visit.  In no event shall failure to inspect the XCALIBIR facility constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.

If required, an amendment including questions and answers shall be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Paula Wilkison at paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than Wednesday, August 20, 2008 at 3:30PM EST.

REQUIREMENT:  TITLE: AARP/NCI Research Study Newsletter

PRODUCT:  4 panel folder, which will comply with optical scanning, 2 mail drops, OCR scanning and database creations for undeliverable/white mail.

BASIS FOR AWARD:   The award will be based upon two sets of prices from the offerors. First a “lot price” for all the manufacturing operations on a total quantity of 500,000 newsletters, sufficient to do the two mailings detailed within these specifications, plus an additional thousands rate. 

Second, an “Updating Price” per thousand responses for the newsletter, based upon a minimum quantity of 15,000 surveys. Again, with an additional thousands rate for more undeliverable/white mail to be processed, should they be received. All costs shall be defined within these figures. No additional charges shall be considered as the basis of the award (or paid on the invoice, without a contractual modification.)

QUALITY:   Level 2 printing and finishing attributes are required for this specification.  Reference GPO publication 310.1 for attribute requirements. Printing is the predominate production function and none shall be subcontracted. All contractors offering a bid shall have passed the NCI Requirements for New Bidders
prior to consideration of their proposal for award. A minimum sixty calendar days are necessary for the evaluation processing to be completed.	

FACILITIES RESTRICTION: Production of the entire project within one facility is the predominate production function. No operations shall be subcontracted without the written permission of both the Contracting and the Project Officers, as well as the principal investigator. Joint vendor proposals shall NOT be considered. Your proposal to the government shall clearly state your “in-house” capabilities prior to
consideration for award or your request for sub-contracting of any necessary operations. Contractual award takes place after approval(s), if these are necessary to your proposal for the government.

QUANTITY:  500,000 total copies and the final film/files used in the production of printing.

PAPER:   Letter: 60# opaque white smooth finish offset, suitable for OCR. Grain dimension,
reflectance and brightness to meet minimums for equipment used.

Only those papers listed above as approved equals will be considered. See the 42nd edition
(May 2008 issue) of the Competitive Grade Finder. American mill brand manufactured papers
only, private label papers and or foreign manufactured papers shall not be acceptable.

TRIM SIZES:	8-3/8” x 14”, folding as 2 parallel folds to a final size of 8-1/2” x 3-5/8”.

FURNISHED MATERIALS:  A Mac OS-X compatible CD-Rom disk, together with a set of color proofs (laser printed dummy) as a guide to production. Quarkxpress, Illustrator, and Photoshop applications are used for desktop publishing. A 500,000 name (as a single CSV text file) database of addresses will be supplied, for the study participants expected to participate in the mailing. This file contains various fields required for the creation of database, as well as fields necessary to effect mailings.

PROOFS: Proofing techniques vary by component. “Live Proofs” will be required for approval on all laser or inkjet personalized & variable data components. A sampling of 10 random live samples will be used for these proofs. Data dump of 10 records, personalized, showing truncations, inserted and submitted for approval. Proofs to be created using actual stock and production techniques, which will be used during the full production run. All other components of this project will be proofed using a forms proofing process, 2 sets required. This process utilizes inkjet technology and adequately indicates color break, position, type quality, page position, and form imposition (where applicable). Accurate representation of PMS color on proof will not be required. PMS color specifications instead, will be followed in the pressroom and require approval by the government, prior to commencing the press run. Color shall be uniform within each package with a consistency of ink density throughout entire production run, as outlined in these specifications. Walter Burroughs is solely the government’s Quality Control representative.

BINDING:  Trim four sides (no bleeds) to an approximate flat size of 8-3/8 x 14 inches. Fold as two parallel folds to a final size after binding of 8-3/8” x 3-5/8”, as in half and in half again.

Inkjet created barcode to be suitable for OCR scanning at the same time as scanline function data retrieval. Since human participants are involved in this study, particular care must be exercised to protect their privacy, including documents and signatures
on non-disclosure agreements filed with the principal investigator and the Research Contracting Branch office. The contractor must agree to adhere to principals of human subjects protection as codified in the regulations (45 CFR 46) and a HIPAA agreement must be filed by the contractor.

MAILING: List database will be converted, formatted, genderized, properly cased for upper and lower case, zip + 4 coded, bar coded per US Postal Service requirements to allow for presorting, and to obtain best possible Postal Fee discounts as appropriate for permit being used (G-806). Database furnished is required to be run and compared against National Change of Address database by the printing contractor, at their expense, prior to commencement of addressing. The contractor will be expected to “keystroke entry of forwarding addresses” for 5,000 undeliverable/white mail, with the labor value included in the lot price.
These represent the returned mail due to currency of the NCOA “Stop List” prior to first mailing. The contractor will provide a receipt location for the returned surveys, including any necessary freight, solely at their expense. The contractor will also communicate (by email) with the program staff for weekly updates
of return responses.

Back-up prints in a similar style to the face. Moderate coverage of ink is required.

NOTE: The furnished electronic files for do not contain masks, or traps and the contractor shall create these items as part of their production. Although only moderate ink coverage is required, the contractor must still take any and all necessary precautions to prevent ghosting and lay a smooth, uniform ink film. Do not assume “perfecting” is acceptable to the government. The inspector shall use the following criteria to determine acceptability. If the inspector is unable to determine by examination which side is first down, then press perfecting is acceptable. Ghosting & “in-line problems” shall not be acceptable.

DISPLAY EXAMINATION: Examination of the furnished materials is an integral part of specifications. No additional payment will be allowed due the contractor’s failure to examine the copy and thoroughly understand the nature and extent of the work to be performed.

PRESS INSPECTION:  Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractors printing facility for quality conformance. Each press sheet form must contain one color bar, at least 3/16 inch in width, for each ink color placed parallel to the ink rollers.  Color control bars (such as, BRUNNER, GATF or GRETAG) must contain star targets, trapping, tint and dot gain patches, process built grays, if applicable, and extend the full width of the press sheet. Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus 1/2 of one percent. Light and heavy inking is not allowed. The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000 degree kelvin light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray booth and functional densitometers.

PREAWARD SURVEY:  In order to determine the responsibility of the prime contractor, the government reserves the right to conduct a preaward survey, or to require samples to QATAP evaluate, or other evidence of technical, managerial, financial and similar abilities to perform, prior to the award of a contract. The scope of this project will require the assignment of a single suitably capable managing project officer by the contractor. (authorized in writing to act on behalf of the firm)
 
DATA CAGING: The contractor will perform Identification of all undeliverable/white mail and caging of information for each of the two mail drops (separately!), including the creation of the database described below.

<DESC>SAMHSA/CMHS/DSSI/CSPB through the Department of Health and Human 
Services, Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Sourcing, Division
Acquisition Management intends to award a sole source, Simplified Acquisition, in accordance with FAR Part 13.105, to the University of Illinois at Chicago, Center on Mental Health
Services, Research and Policy, Department of Psychiatry, their unique primary research that has focused on the issue of asset development, and its use for people with mental illness.  The University of Chicago has performed all the seminal work related to this topic and possesses a unique understanding of the potential approaches.

BACKGROUND:		

Numerous studies have identified that individuals with severe mental illness often have incomes and support payments that combine to amounts that are below or just above the Federal Poverty Level.  Other studies have demonstrated that people who are poor and some of those who have disabilities can effectively work their way out of poverty.  Still other studies have shown that asset development programs can increase the speed and likelihood of individuals working their way out of poverty.  What has not been fully demonstrated is that asset development programs, in combination with effective treatment, social support programs and employment support programs can accelerate the recovery of individuals with severe mental illness and permit them to decrease or eliminate their reliance on government support program.  

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, through the Center for Mental Health Services (MHS) recognizes that successful recovery from severe mental illness is an important social goal and that recovery to a level that permits an individual to decrease or eliminate reliance on government support programs is a good indicator of success.  

What is needed is an assessment of whether asset development programs can effectively be used in combination with other programs of support and treatment to increase the likelihood and potentially accelerate recovery for an individual who has severe mental illness. 

7. OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can be tested to assess the value of asset development programs as part of a program of treatment and support programs in increasing the likelihood and speed of recovery for an individual who is disabled by severe mental illness.  This model would need to be based on a solid foundation that reflects all of the research that has been completed regarding the structure of asset development programs as well as of treatment and support system programs.  To ensure that the recommended approach can be practically implemented, the research will need to include identification of all currently available and funded programs that could be used to test the model that is developed.  


8.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK

<SUBJECT>IDENTIFYING EFFECTIVE POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR PROJECT LAUNCH GRANTEES
<SOLNBR>08M000136
<RESPDATE>080808
<CONTACT>Raleigh Tanner, Phone 202-260-8856, Fax 202-690-6630, Email raleigh.tanner@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>SAMHSA/CMHS/DSSI/CSPB through the Department of Health and Human 
Services, Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Sourcing, Division
Acquisition Management intends to award a sole source, Simplified Acquisition, 
FAR Part 13.105, to the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP). NCCP is uniquely qualified to provide support to Project LAUNCH grantees possessing the specialized services needed to complete the requirements of this award. NCCP’s unique qualifications are also established knowledge and resource-base of the Project Launch requirements.

Background:

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was created in 1992 to work in partnership with States to improve prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals with mental health issues and substance abuse disorders.  Within SAMHSA the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment provide national leadership and direction for policies, programs and activities designed to improve mental health prevention and treatment for services for people with mental health issues and substance abuse and their families, and people at risk of mental illness or substance abuse. The Centers also work with State and local systems to improve and enhance mental health and substance abuse treatment, illness prevention, wellness promotion, and support services placing these services and programs within the reach of all Americans.   

In FY 2008 CMHS received appropriations for a new grant program called Project LAUNCH (Linking Actions for Unmet Needs in Children's Health). The purpose of Project LAUNCH is to promote the physical, emotional, social, and behavioral health of young children, birth to 8 years of age.  The project's vision is that all young children will be ready for school, learning successfully, and thriving in safe supportive environments.  The mission of this project is to create a shared vision for the wellness of young children that drives the development of Federal, State, Territorial, Tribal, and local networks for the coordination of key child-serving systems and the integration of behavioral and physical health services. 

Project LAUNCH will provide funding through cooperative agreements to States, Territories, and Tribes in order to enhance planning, policy reform, and coordination to support young child wellness, as well as to fund a local pilot that will build infrastructure and support services.  States, Territories, and Tribes receiving funds will be required to develop comprehensive plans to support child wellness and bring together key agencies and stakeholders to drive change. 

It is anticipated that the majority of Project Launch grantees will build on HRSA funded Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS) Grants that currently exist in 47 States and three Territories and are focused on the development of comprehensive early childhood plans at the State and Territorial level.  Project LAUNCH grantees from states and territories with ECCS grants will be charged with building on existing ECCS efforts and Federal staff from SAMHSA and HRSA are working closely to coordinate the two initiatives.   

In addition to supporting the development of infrastructure and policy reform at the State, Territorial, Tribal level, Project LAUNCH will support infrastructure development and enhanced programs, services, and supports at the local level.  Through the prior efforts of the ECCS program much has been learned about state level policy and systems development in support of comprehensive early childhood systems and young child wellness.  There is still a need to develop a comparable knowledge base to support the infrastructure and policy development activities of LAUNCH grants at the local level.  Federal staff has identified two issues that will be particularly important to developing successful projects at the local level: 1) Financing and 2) Measures and indicators.  

Issues surrounding financing will be critical to the success of Project LAUNCH for a number of reasons.  Understanding and successfully exploiting funding streams is critical to the type of coordination Project LAUNCH is designed to support.  Currently there is not a coordinated approach to financing early childhood services in many communities.  This contributes to an atmosphere of disconnected services, in which communities may not be aware of the many funding streams that finance early childhood services and do little to use those funds to promote strategic goals related to young child wellness. Understanding the sources of available funding, and having a better understanding of models for braiding or combining funding, would enable strategic planning, enhance service coordination, and enable increased sustainability of programs.
  
Developing a data infrastructure and coordinating common measures across service systems is also important.  Better understanding the range of indicators available should allow us to better assess program outcomes, and better exploit existing sources of data, reducing burden on grantees. Identifying common outcome measures should also allow local communities to compare programs, and better understand the developmental progress of children in the systems and programs with which they interact.

  - Objective of the Contract:
 	
This contract will develop needed resources to support LAUNCH grantees and the activities undertaken at the local level.  Project activities will include issue briefs in two key areas: measures and indicators of child wellness at the local level, and financing at the local level. The contractor shall develop a presentation focusing on a common policy issue faced by grantees identified during the early stages of the grant program.  This presentation will take place at the second grantee meeting, which will most likely take place in the spring of 2009.  During the initial stages of the grant, the separately funded national evaluation contractor will work with federal staff and grantees to identify common measures and refine their evaluation model.  This contract will also support consultation from Project THRIVE to support this effort.

Acquisition Management intends to award a sole source, Simplified Acquisition, 
FAR Part 13.105, to Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA). CADCA is unique as to the only organization that works on behalf of over 5,000 community coalitions across the country and hence has ready access to the most diverse coalitions in the nation, as well as the only organization with a Coalition Institute that has the most extensive expertise on coalition development, management and capacity building that can provide the most cost effective analysis of how community coalitions can leverage the Americorps  program to deliver substance abuse prevention in communities.

Statement of Work/Overview:

The purpose of this contract is to provide an analysis of the feasibility of using the AmeriCorps project to increase the workforce in the prevention field by establishing a Prevention Fellowship program with local community coalitions through AmeriCorps.

Addressing Workforce Development Needs through AmeriCorps

CADCA will provide an analysis of the feasibility of using the AmeriCorps project to increase the workforce in the prevention field by establishing a Prevention Fellowship program with local community coalitions through AmeriCorps. This Fellowship program would be implemented at the community level by the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) organization in partnership with local community coalitions. This Fellowship will offer college graduates and health professionals seeking a career in prevention and health promotion an opportunity to be exposed to information, experts, and mentors in the substance abuse prevention field to encourage them to become practitioners.  Participation in the AmeriCorps program will also provide funding to the participants for additional certifications, trainings, and degrees to equip them with the skills to be effective substance abuse addiction practitioners. 

The AmeriCorps project is a innovative workforce development initiative that will increase the substance abuse prevention workforce. The AmeriCorps project will provide a pipeline of young and diverse professionals to address the growing service demand and the approaching retirement of large segments of the substance abuse prevention workforce. Additional training will be provided for AmeriCorps participants to better prepare them to address the changing profile of communities in need, which includes co-occurring mental illnesses and substance use disorders, medical comorbidity, rapidly evolving patterns of licit and illicit drug use, and involvement in the criminal justice system that requires a more prepared and skilled staff. The AmeriCorps project will provide communities a “real-time” response to workforce development that is not dependent on State budgets or additional State funding. 

Period of Performance: 12 months from contract award date

Deliverables:

1 - Receipt and approval of contract plan due 15 days after contract award.

2 - Approval of meeting agenda and Invitation List with a selected group of constituents (community coalition leaders), due within 10 days of approval of both.

3 -Approval of Feasibility Report, due on or before September 30, 2009.

BUY AMERICAN ACT/BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROGRAM				EXHIBIT B

1.	BUY AMERICAN ACT – CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS  (FAR 52.225-9)(MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- 
"Component" means any article, material, or supply incorporated directly into construction materials. 
"Construction material" means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material. 
"Cost of components" means-- 
(1)	For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation 
costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or 
(2)	For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of 
the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product. 
"Domestic construction material" means-- 
(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or 
(2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if the cost of its components mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which non-availability determinations have been made are treated as domestic. 
"Foreign construction material" means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. 
"United States" means the 50 States and the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other place subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but does not include leased bases. 
(b) Domestic preference. (1) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) and the Balance of Payments Program by providing a preference for domestic construction material. The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause. 
(2) This requirement does not apply to the construction material or components listed by the Government as follows: _________________________________________________________________________________
[Contracting Officer to list applicable excepted materials or indicate "none"] 
(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that-- 
(i)	The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular 
domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent; 
(ii)	The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or 
(iii)	The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in 
sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. 




										Exhibit B
										Page 2

 (c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including-- 
	
(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials; 
(B) Unit of measure; 
(C) Quantity; 
(D) Price; 
(E) Time of delivery or availability; 
(F) Location of the construction project; 
(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and 
(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. 
(i)	A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and 
any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued). 
(ii)	Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain 
why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination. 
(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program. 
(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers.

2.	NOTICE OF BUY AMERICAN ACT – CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (FAR 52.225-10) (MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. "Construction material," "domestic construction material," and "foreign construction material," as used in this provision, are defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Buy American Act-Construction Materials" (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.225-9). 
(b) Requests for determinations of inapplicability.

*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter

	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

<DESC><p>Request for Quotation
<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), located in Bethesda, MD on the National Naval Medical Campus has a requirement for the purchase of a Digital Wireless Intercom System. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested. This is a request for quotations (RFQ) in accordance with FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is the responsibility of the contractor to monitor FedBizOpps for any amendments to the solicitation. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisitions Circular 05-25. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a quote, which will be considered by USUHS. For this procurement, the applicable NAICS code is 334290 (Intercom systems and equipment manufacturing) with a size standard of 750 employees. The items requested by USUHS are as follows:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing for the following Contract Line Item Number (CLIN):</p>
<p>CLIN Quantity Description<br />0001 1 10 Base Station/Controller <br />0002 10 Wireless beltpack<br />0003 2 Active Antenna <br />0004 10 Headsets<br />0005 1 Shipping Fees (if applicable)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR THE UNIFORMED SERVICES UNIVERSITY of the HEALTH SCIENCES (USUHS)</p>
<p><br />This wireless intercom system (with headsets) will allow the USUHS Simulation Center employees to communicate instantly while working together in different locations to create immersive educational simulations to train military medical personnel. Because these simulations are immersive, it is imperative that we be able to communicate in a manner that will not disturb the trainees or take away from their educational goals. At the same time, since these simulations require the coordination of dozens of employees, actors, and learners, and must be timed perfectly with computer programs and learner actions, the ability to communicate instantly, clearly, and without being attached to wires (since we cannot guarantee that any one employee will be able to remain in the same place continually) is imperative.</p>
<p>The 10 base station is needed as specific positions/persons will be needed to run large scale events that cover the full Simulation Center. The antennas shall boost the wireless signal and insure that all employees are able to stay in contact at greater distances. Since the wireless signal will have to pass through several walls with steel supports inside which can disrupt the signals, the active antennas shall help prevent that.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors: The government will award a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote, conforming to this announcement, will be most advantageous to the government.</p>
<p>1. Price - Offerors are to provide pricing breakdowns if each additional component is priced separately. Offerors are to provide the unit of issue and the unit cost for the aforementioned item and its features.<br />2. Technical - Offers are to provide product literature containing details of the machine, details of the installation and/or training, and warranty information and lead time.</p>
<p>Award will be made on a best value determination considering price and non-price factors.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Harris HF Communications Equipment. AF/RSA-ACOTA has identified that the Harris HF Communications equipment is an essential component of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) UNAMID contingents communication suite. The equipment listed is required to complement Harris communications equipment already in use by the ENDF in UNAMID (Darfur) and replace damaged and missing components of the communication equipment already in use.  Reliable communications is an essential element of the ENDFs performance in Darfur.  Provision of equipment other than the type already in use by the ENDF would result in maintenance, supply and   operational interoperability problems that would diminish the performance of the ENDF contingent in Darfur.  The 41 USC 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the product identified by brand name herein has been the primary communication system used by the ACOTA trained Ethiopian military in support of the UN peacekeeping operations in Darfur (UNAMID).  The Harris HF Communications equipment has been proven to be a worthy piece of equipment for the ENDF.  Any other communication system will not meet the sustainment goals of replacement of damage or missing components, the training for the use and care of this specialized equipment that is already in use by the deployed peacekeeping force as the Harris HF Communications equipment is the primary items written in these solicitation.The requirement will be competed as the field support community responds to price requests on Fed Bid.There is no other manufacture of the listed equipment so market research was not conducted. It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the Fed Bid process.<BR><BR>

Statement of Work
National Surface Water Chemistry Protocols for Air Pollution Sensitive Waters
30 June 2008

a.	Introduction: The contractor shall provide all personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services to accomplish the objectives and requirements contained in this purchase order to develop integrated protocols providing standard, efficient, and cost-effective methodologies for field sampling water sources and performing lab analyses.

b.	Background: 
1.  The Forest Service Air Resource Management program has a 25+ year history of the monitoring surface water chemistry of our highest and often most pristine lakes and streams. These inventory and monitoring programs are typically designed to identify sensitive water bodies, to determine status and to track trends of waters sensitive to atmospheric deposition.  Data from these programs are used not only to aid the Forest Service in land management, but are used in State planning processes, in industry pollution permitting and to provide the States, EPA, other Federal agencies invaluable information in their decision-making processes.  The data from these programs must be of the highest quality possible to withstand scientific and legal scrutiny.  Though most of these data have been collected under an established protocol, the Air program believes that it is to the Forest Service’s benefit to have standard field, lab, quality assurance/quality control, and data analysis protocols for the sensitive surface water chemistry sampling.

2.  Background materials from which the protocols will be developed include “Air Quality Related Values and Development of Associated Protocols for Evaluation of the Effects of Atmospheric Deposition on Aquatic and Terrestrial Resources on Forest Service Lands (Sullivan and Herlihy, 2007)”1 and “Field Guide for Surface Water Sample and Data Collection (Turk, 2001)”2 as background material for developing field protocols.  Other sources will include the Forest Service Aquatic Ecological Unit Inventory protocols, EPA standard and USGS protocols.  Existing lab protocols and methodologies in use at the Air Resource Management Laboratory should be evaluated and incorporated as appropriate.

c.	Project Deliverables: Specific tasks include:

1.   Draft protocol development:  Develop integrated protocols providing standard, efficient, and cost-effective methodologies for field sampling, and lab analyses.

<CONTACT>Patricia Wright, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-827-7217, Fax 301-827-7101, Email patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking proposals for a contractor to fulfill a requirement for a program titled:   Scientific Program to Support Epidemiologic Investigations of Safety Released Issues of Marketed Drugs, and Evaluations of Risk Management Programs and Tools.
 
The primary objectives to be accomplished under these contracts are to provide FDA with: 1) Conduct drug safety analyses of importance to FDA using both retrospective and prospective methods, as appropriate; 2) Establish a collaborative arrangement with existing pharmacoepidemiologic research programs for the purpose of conducting epidemiologic studies of drug safety issues using databases containing electronic health information; 3) Establish a collaborative arrangement with existing pharmacoepidemiologic research programs for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of risk management programs and tools using databases containing electronic health information; 4) Obtain technical assistance or consultative support on methods and the use of electronic healthcare data resources for conducting pharmacoepidemiologic research, and; 5) Enable timely access to US and Canadian population-based data sources to ensure public safety when necessary.  

Data Requirements: Successful Contractors will have continuous access to an updated electronic healthcare data resource containing patient-level health encounter data from the U.S. or Canada.  The data resource shall be a computerized system able to link each patient to all relevant medical care data including enrollment status, drug exposure data, and coded medical outcomes.  This data resource will meet the criteria specified in the minimum mandatory criteria throughout the length of the contract.  Linkage of this data resource to additional information, including vital records, chronic disease and/or cancer registries, and birth defect registries, if available, is also of interest.  It shall be solely the Contractor’s responsibility to insure that the data are HIPAA-compliant, and to de-identify the data for FDA use. FDA will require no patient-, provider-, or health plan-specific identifiers.  All research performed by the FDA PRP centers must comply with standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information and protect the rights of human subjects in research.

For the purpose of this requirement, the data resource shall be sufficient to meet FDA’s need to access patient-level data describing health encounters and prescription drug use by individuals over time.  The data resource shall have longitudinal data that shall be capable of following uniquely identifiable individuals (using encrypted patient identifiers) over time.  Demographic information (e.g. age and gender), health history, diagnoses and procedures, and hospitalizations shall be provided.  Information on race/ethnicity shall be included, if available, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  The data resource shall also have the ability to identify pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes as well as have the ability to subsequently link maternal and child records after birth.

In addition, for each patient these data shall contain prescription drug and biologic utilization information, including the generic and brand name of the product, strength, dosage form, days supply, all dates dispensed, initial/continuing therapy indicator, quantity dispensed, instructions for use (if available), indication for use (if available) and prescriber specialty.   The resource shall employ the use of a generally accepted, granular coding system for drugs and medical products, as well as for diagnoses and procedures.  In addition, the contractor shall have the ability to determine that the drug or biologic was dispensed to the patient, rather than just prescribed to the patient.

All patient medical diagnostic information shall be represented in the data resource, including diagnoses and procedures associated with all ambulatory, emergency, chronic or acute care setting visits and their dates, diagnoses and procedures associated with all related hospitalizations and their dates, and all laboratory tests and results (if available) and their dates.  Other health measures (such as family health history, height, weight, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use, blood pressure measurements, etc.), are of interest if available.  The successful Contractors shall have the capability of accessing inpatient medical records for validating coded diagnostic data; access to outpatient medical records is also of interest if available.

The ability to contact a sample of physicians and/or a sample of patients/caregivers on an ad hoc basis for information beyond what is available in the data source (e.g., survey to determine reasons for prescribing decisions, use of informed consent, use of nonprescription drugs and/or medical products, comprehension of consumer medication information) is also of interest.

FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competitive requirement.  

The solicitation will be available for download on or about August 26, 2008 and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.   No hardcopies will be distributed. Any questions concerning this requirement must be submitted in writing by e-mail only, to Patricia Wright at patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov.  NO PHONES WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>This contract is intended to provide for watershed protection and restoration by stabilizing active erosion in meadows and small drainages. Work required to stabilize these areas includes reshaping vertical banks to allow vegetative recovery, and machine placement of rock in drainages to prevent additional scour from seasonal flows. Specific work items include excavation in meadows often requiring conservation of topsoil, and preserving and re-planting living sod of perennial grasses. Excavation will also take place in steep and eroded ephemeral channels and existing gullies requiring trenching and mechanical placement of rocks and boulders. Work will also entail placement of erosion control blanket and rolled erosion control products to enhance vegetation establishment and survivability on slopes and in channels. Erosion control design requirements may include below grade placement of geotextile products as a permeable separator/stabilizer, to prevent piping of soil beneath new or existing structures. Erosion control products and geotextile materials will be provided by the government.   This contract will also provide for watershed protection through the repair of roads, to improve drainage function, including outsloping.. Work under this contract will include measures that restore hillslope hydrologic function by removing drainage structures, ripping compacted areas, and recontouring as needed. Equipment rental with operator and miscellaneous labor is provided for in this contract to perform work within this scope in order to adapt repairs or improvements to deal with variations in site conditions or unique design requirements.  Also anticipated for the loading and haul of materials (e.g. rocks and boulders) from designated areas to the project work site. No unique or specialized equipment is required to perform work under this contract. However, equipment size, weight and capacity will be specified because of the hydrologic and ecological sensitivity of the work areas. Work will be performed primarily by the hour and directed by the Forest Service. 
All work to be performed either on the San Bernardino National Forest or Cleveland National Forest.  The resulting contract will be a three year IDIQ contract with 3-5 awards for each forest.  The solicitation when it is available on or about August 1, 2008 on this FEDBIZOPPS site will be advertised as a commercial item under FAR Part 12 procedures.  Contractors will be required to list their equipment such as dozers, excavators, and dump trucks by type and size along with any attachments or special features the equipment has.  This will be a 100% HUB Zone Set-aside with a cascading feature so that if at least three well-qualified HUB Zone contractors with fair and reasonable prices cannot be selected, then Small Businesses that are not HUB Zone may be considered.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 1 CHANGES SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD ONLY.


Appraisals for Properties Enrolled in USDA, NRCS Easement Programs in NH, VT & ME

This is a pre-solicitation notice by the Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, VT State Office, to obtain appraisal services for acquisition of conservation easements on behalf of the United States of America, acting by and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.  The conservation easements will be for wetlands and other conservation practices in accordance with the Wetlands Reserve Program and other Farm Bill programs.  The contractor shall furnish all appraisal services according to USPAP guidelines.

For planning purposes, there are expected to be approximately 30 appraisals to be completed in each contract year.   The solicitation will be divided into zones for proposal and order purposes.  Respondents may offer on any or all zones.  It is estimated that between five (5) and thirty (30) appraisals per year may be needed.  The minimum order guaranteed by the government is one appraisal per contract awarded.  Total delivery orders issued against each contract for all years can not exceed $500,000.  The contractor will also be asked to submit pricing for time-sensitive delivery of services (less than 20 day turn-around) in addition to regular pricing.  

The NRCS intends to award an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) fixed-price contract to a small business source capable of providing real estate appraisals for a base period of one year and four option years for a total of approximately five years. An IDIQ fixes a price for an appraisal, should it be ordered.  There is a guaranteed minimum of one appraisal per contract for the base year and no guaranteed minimum for the option periods.  It is anticipated that more than one contract may be awarded from the solicitation.  

The contractor is responsible for having a current knowledge of the requirements of state law in connection with real estate transactions and appraisals.  Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a state temporary practice permit and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued. Appraisers must demonstrate competency in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type. All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with USPAP and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.

This is 100% set-aside for small-business. The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard is $2.0 million in average annual receipts.

All contractors must register in the Central Contractor’s Registration database at www.ccr.gov. The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at: 1-888-227-2423. The first step to registering is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B). To request a DUNS number, call D&B at the toll free number 1-866-705-5711 or register on-line at http://www.dnb.com/ccr/register.html. Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge. It’s a good idea for anyone who is submitting a proposal to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete.

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) plans to award a contract requiring technical and administrative support, and information technology design and development services relating primarily to physical security. The various programs include, among others, the following: Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) and executive orders compliance, USDA Capital Planning and Investment Control support, emergency planning, counter-terrorism recommendations and implementation, and maintenance of various existing systems. The procurement will be conducted using competitive procedures and is set-aside for SBA 8(a) firms. Only proposals from 8(a) firms will be considered.

Services to be performed under the new contract will be a continuation of services currently being performed by Communication Resource, Incorporated (CRI), McLean, Virginia, under contract number AG-3142-C-06-0048. The contract will be structured as an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract, with procurement of work provided under separate, negotiated task orders. The task orders will be performed on fixed-price and time-and-material bases. The majority of work will be performed at USDA offices in Washington, DC, and at the contractor's facilities. Some travel may be required to other USDA regional offices. The contract will have one base year and four option years, and has an anticipated award date of September 15, 2008. It is expected that the request for proposals (RFP) for this requirement will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website on, or about, August 1, 2008, and will be issued under solicitation number AG-3142-S-08-0033. All interested parties must obtain or have a Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), Federal Identification Number (FID), be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, and be certified as an 8(a) contractor by the Small Business Administration.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p>We at Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) imagine and envision a world in which information is virtual and on demand with global reach. Information is protected by identity based capabilities that allow users to connect, be identified, and access needed information in a trusted manner. It is a world in which United States military forces can deploy and connect no matter where they are located, pull information needed for their missions, and be given timely, accurate information on any threats they may face. It is a world with no seams between the sustaining base and the tactical edge so that operational agility is enabled. It is a world in which the United States military can freely exchange information routinely with coalition partners and others responsible for the security and defense of the United States. The technology employed is agile, adaptive, and capabilities-based. And, we imagine and envision a world in which our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are equipped with capabilities and services that are state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>As such, DISA has a requirement to obtain independent, third party consultative and advisory services without institutional biases, downstream business or political interests, or pre-existing organizational alignment. DISA requires objective, recognized thought leadership in a broad spectrum IT management and technology disciplines, and intimate knowledge of DISA's strategic goals and objectives being helpful. In this regard, DISA seeks to obtain a flexible and adaptive industry partner to assist with IT strategy, planning, evaluation, and oversight in a myriad of IT management and technology initiatives.</p>
<p>DISA recognizes that many organizational components and personnel have traditionally implemented a decentralized acquisition approach to IT Consulting services at various organizational levels. This requirement intends to improve the maximum value to DISA through competitive pricing and better IT Consulting services targeted to specific strategic imperatives.</p>
<p>Any resulting solicitation for this effort will have strong organizational conflict of interest provisions that will prevent certain business relationships and participation on implementation oriented or operational support oriented delivery orders within DISA In order to provide an independent and objective perspectives to DISA.</p>

DISA will provide Information technology at speeds necessary to bring people together efficiently, help them do their jobs in ways never anticipated, and enable them to do things never envisioned.<br />DISA must aggressively lead in five areas:<br />&bull; Speed - deliver IT capabilities and services faster <br />&bull; Power to edge - extend enterprise services to the edge <br />&bull; Operational excellence - accelerate operational effectiveness and efficiency <br />&bull; Sharing and defending information - enables sharing of information while staunchly protecting it <br />&bull; Best value - customers know and understand the value of DISA capabilities and services</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.0 Scope</strong></span></p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for rotary wing service within Afghanistan.  There is no solicitation package available at this time.

USTRANSCOM/TCAQ-R is seeking sources that may be able to provide rotary wing services capable of flying 150 hours per aircraft for 24 days a month.  Missions will average 6 hours per day and 1,800 hours per year with 1.5 days per week for maintenance.  Contract air must achieve 80% daily availability rate.  At no time will any one location have less than 1 aircraft fully mission capable.  The Government anticipates acquiring 8 medium lift helicopters and 6 heavy lift helicopters.  The medium lift helos should have an estimated passenger capability of 8 - 15 and an internal load between 3,000 lbs and 6,000 lbs and an external load between 5,000 lbs and 8,000 lbs.  The heavylift helos should have an estimated passenger capability of 12-26 and an internal load between 5,000 lbs and 8,000 lbs and an external load between 6,000 lbs and 10,000 lbs.  The Government anticipates the contractor positioning 1 medium lift and 1 heavy lift helo in Bagram; 2 heavy lift helos in Jalalabad; 3 medium lift helos in Salerno; 1 medium and 1 heavy lift helo in Sharana; 2 heavy lift helos in Bamyan and 3 medium lift helos in Kandahar to meet mission requirements. The Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) requires the contractor maintain flexibility which may result in a need to relocate any or all of these aircraft to other locations within Afghanistan.  Contractor must be DoD Approved and be able to transport both passengers and cargo.  Cargo may consist of CLASS I (Food and Water), CLASS II (General Supplies), CLASS III (Fuel), CLASS IV (Construction Materials), CLASS V (Ammunition-small arms only),  CLASS VI (AAFES supplies), CLASS VII (Major End Items), CLASS VIII (Medical Supplies), CLASS IX (Repair Parts), or CLASS  X (non-military goods such as humanitarian assistance items).  The cargo will be configured for loading inside the cabin of the aircraft or prepared for slingload delivery.  The contractor must be prepared to accept cargo in either configuration; internal or slingload.  Multiple awards will be considered.
All interested parties should respond with rotary wing type and capacity that is currently available that would justify the source's qualifications to perform this task.

At this time, USTRANSCOM is NOT looking for proposals. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, nor a Request for Quotations, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

Responses to this RFI are due 31 Jul 08, 1600hrs (CST).  Electronic copies should be submitted to Elaine.Hayes@ustranscom.mil and Krissy.Hackstadt@ustranscom.mil.   If you submit proprietary data, please mark it clearly with the appropriate markings.  Further action on this anticipated requirement will be determined following review of the responses to this RFI.
