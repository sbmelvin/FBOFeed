<DESC>To provide the Director, Office of Human Resources with an assessment of the personnel security operations, screenings, and other functions in the Bureau of Indian Affairs Human Resources Office (BIAHR) (excluding Indian Education Programs), commonly referred to as Balance of the Bureau (BOB). The Office of Human Resources provides human resources guidance, coordination, oversight, and evaluation of all Office of the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) human resources programs including those provided via contractual arrangements.  The Office consists of approximately 90 staff - a Director and 18 field offices - that provide the full range of human resources and benefits services to the BIA with a service population of approximately 10,650 employees. The Personnel Security Office (PSO) within the Office of Human Resources is responsible for processing all background investigations for BOB to include all contractor personnel and, with the advent of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-12), all tribal users of bureau information systems.  The bureau hires approximately 1,500 new employees each year, 1,900 contractor personnel, and grants logical access to approximately 360 tribal users.  Because of current short staffing within the POS and the additional requirements placed on the security program as a result of HSPD-12, it is imperative that an assessment of workflow, case management, and data retrieval systems be conducted.  This assessment will assist the Director in determining the best course of action with respect to the BOB personnel security program. +++++++++CRUCIAL DATES AND OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION+++++++ >>>>>>>>>>>>>>THIS PROCUREMENT IS A BUY INDIAN SET ASIDE.

<DESC>Congressional Research Service
        Statement of Work  for Graphic Design Support 


A.	BACKGROUND 

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is the public policy research arm of the United States Congress.  As a legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress, CRS works exclusively and directly for Members of Congress, their Committees and staff on confidential, nonpartisan basis.  The CRS staff comprises nationally recognized experts in a range of issues and disciplines, including law, economics, foreign affairs, public administration, social, political sciences, and natural sciences. 

Congress created CRS to serve its needs for nonpartisan and objective research and analysis of  legislative policy issues.  CRS provides timely, confidential, and authoritative research and analysis to Members, committees, and their staff.  CRS provides comprehensive support in foreign policy, economics, law, science, political science, and social policy.  CRS also covers the operations and procedures of both Chambers, legislative processes for the Federal budget and appropriations, and all constitutional issues including separation of powers, war powers, impeachment, and electoral procedures.

CRS analysts, attorneys, and information specialists work closely with Members and committees to explain policy problems, develop options and legislative proposals, conduct legal analysis of pending legislation, deliver testimony before congressional committees, prepare products on current legislative issues, write confidential memoranda, and provide personal consultations.  CRS  also conducts seminars on public policy and legal issues as well as training in the legislative and budget processes.

CRS has a requirement for graphic design support for several CRS products on a continuing basis.  The objective is to create or update materials using the existing CRS logo design and previously developed design themes and standards, so that they have a consistent look with existing materials and are engaging to congressional and CRS audiences. 

B.	SCOPE OF WORK 

CRS has been working on building a visual awareness with designs that are engaging, understated and elegant. This program is being administered by the Associate Director for Congressional Affairs and Counselor to the Director of the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. 

Our clients, congressional staff, have a high turn over rate compared to other industries.  In addition, they receive vast amounts of information daily and our products need designs that are both engaging and easily recognizable as a CRS product.

 
The objective of this contract is to create or update materials using the existing CRS logo design and previously developed design themes and standards (i.e. color palette and design elements) so that they have a consistent look with existing materials and are engaging to congressional and CRS audiences. 

C.  	REQUIREMENTS 

There are four requirements.

C1. 	The contractor or their representative must be in the local area (within 35 mile of the Library of Congress) and within the Library of Congress=s messenger service area.  

C2. 	Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment and facilities needed to produce the deliverables outlined in this contract.

C3. 	All final art work in digital form will be prepared on a Macintosh computer with a writable CD-Rom drive, using the listed version or higher of the following programs: Adobe Illustrator CS2, InDesign CS2, Photoshop CS2, Acrobat 6.0 and Quark Express 6.5.

C4. 	The contractor must have Adobe Caslon and Univers fonts.  Other supplies or expenses such as internal or external color proofs and comps, CDs or zip disks, local transportation, messenger service, overnight mail and copies are to be included as part of the contractor=s cost. 

D.  	PROCESS

The seven part process for each deliverable is as follows:

D1.	At the start of each project, the contractor will discuss the design options with CRS representatives (either at a meeting or a conference call, as decided by CRS).  The contractor=s representatives must include a principal of the firm or the proposed designer (this may be same person). The contractor shall be given a minimum of four day=s notice of initial meeting or conference call and three days= notice for an additional meeting or conference call, at the option of the Library.

D2.	The contractor will provide a detailed design and production schedule for each project.  For at least one project but no more than three projects during the contract, last minute design changes will have to be made due to changes in the congressional schedule. 

D3.	There will be at least four rounds of CRS review with CRS comments and changes incorporated into each round.  Included in the rounds of review are the initial creative concepts and layout reviews as follows:

!	submission of three initial creative concepts with folding paper comps as appropriate, accompanied by PMS chips and recommended paper samples
!	revision of creative concepts
!	Two to three rounds of layout review and revisions.

D4.	All text for designs will either be given to the contractor/designer in WordPerfect format,  in the text of an email, or via fax.
 
D5.	Photography, when used, will be a combination of CRS supplied photos, stock photos, and new photography from contractor/designer managed photo shoots.


D6.	 The contractor/designer will prepare a final release printing package.  It will include two copies of each of the following: 

!	GPO form 952 including printing specifications and file list
!	hard copy markups with screen percentages marked (not color separations) and folding comps

F. 	KEY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS 

A principal of the company must be at all meetings or conference calls.  If contact is mostly through the designer, then the proposed designer must also be present. This may be the same person if the proposed designer is also a principal of the company.

 
If one or more of the key personnel becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this contract such that it would substantially affect the final delivery date of any one item, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and, subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer=s Technical Representative, promptly replace such personnel with personnel of at least substantially equal qualifications.

All requests for approval of substitutions hereunder must be in writing and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions.  They must contain a complete resume for the proposed substitute and any other information requested by the Contracting Officer or needed to approve or disapprove the proposed substitution.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate such requests and promptly notify the contractor of approval or disapproval thereof in writing.

If  the Contracting Officer determines the suitability and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated or have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not reasonably forthcoming or that the resultant reduction of productive effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of the contract or the services ordered, the contract may be terminated by the Contracting Officer for default or for the convenience of the Government, as appropriate, or, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer if he/she finds the contractor at fault for the condition, the contract price may be equitably adjusted downward to compensate the Government for any resultant delay, loss or damage.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center intends to issue a solicitation and award a requirements type contract, with a base year and four (one year) option periods for the purchase of API 2C Certified Single Point Marine Crane systems for installation on 270’ Medium Endurance Cutters.  The system will replace the existing Marine Crane with a new crane capable of launching and retrieving from the water a rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) 22 foot in length, 9 foot beam and 5000 pounds fully loaded.  The estimated quantity for this proposed contract for the base year and all option years is 13.  In addition to the marine crane, the Coast Guard will be requesting other deliverables such as drawings, manuals and reports.  Quantities will be identified in the solicitation.  
The crane shall be located the same as the current crane and is subject to significant weight (8000 pounds) and height (generally 8’9” at the pedestal) limitations.  All parts of the crane in the stowed position or when suspending the boat at the ready position at deck level alongside must fall below the helicopter flight path above the crane position.  The crane may exceed these height limitations while in transition from stowed position to the ready position.  The required reaches vary based upon the crane’s design but the maximum reach must be at least 17 feet and the minimum must be no greater than 15 feet, the preferred minimum reach is 7 feet.  A manual/auxiliary reach of 1000 pounds at up to 21 feet is required for boat maintenance.  The crane shall have a folding, extension, or knuckle boom (or combination thereof) configuration which limits load pendulation by keeping the boom tip as close as possible to the boat during lifting and slewing operations (level luffing).  A constant tension winch is required for maintaining tension on the boat lift point while floating alongside.  The RHIB identified above is larger than is currently installed.  
In general the contractor shall be responsible for supplying all related hardware and machinery including the crane, control station pedestal, electric control panel, HPU, interface requirements for installation, logistics information and materials, and warranty, technical and training services.  This is a systems purchase only and does not include installation of the crane system on the vessels.  
The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps on or about August 2006.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to check FedBizopps on a regular basis for the solicitation and any amendments issued.   Contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR).  To register in CCR go to www.bpn.gov.   See number note 1.

NOTIFICATION OF PRE-SOLICITATION

ENGINEERING PLANT OPERATORS CONTINUUM (EPOC)

On 2 March 2006, NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division posted a Sources/Sought Market Survey stipulating the need for the following requirement: “to support the Center for Naval Engineering (CNE) acquiring the development of asynchronous self-paced training materials for use in the Navy - Integrated Learning Environment (ILE). In the execution of their broad and diverse mission, CNE has a requirement to provide a revised/enhanced, scenario-based curriculum in a self-paced interactive delivery format for the Journeyman skill level engineer(s) referred to as Engineering Plant Operators Course (EPOC). The current training is delivered via approximately 119 instructor-lead C, D, F, and G schools. The EPOC product to be purchased under this contract is to enhance cognitive skill development through a blended solution of re-engineered delivery techniques for Surface Engineering personnel assigned to the fleet.  EPOC is to address the operator and maintenance skill objects required by the Surface Engineers of the Navy’s non-nuclear shipboard propulsion and auxiliary systems. This effort seeks to enhance the course through reduction of the instructor-led, classroom-based portion by delivering initial instruction and refresher training via self-paced Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI). As a result, this effort will require that all forms of instructional strategies, assessment strategies, delivery methods and media be considered in order to provide learning activities and events that will support learning behaviors at the highest level of cognition, including application, synthesis, and evaluation.”   

The purpose for this announcement is to notify industry of the disposition for the EPOC Project, since the posting of the Notification of Planned Solicitation as revised 8 March 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a contract modification on a sole-source basis to Virginia Bioinformatics Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, for a second gene expressio n study for the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  RNA samples from peripheral blood cells of normal volunteers infected with a Class A biowarfare agent (Francisella tularensis) will be sent to VBI to hybridize the RNA samples to array slides, to sca n, and to analyze the data and to provide the finds of this gene expression study to WRAIR.  This study being conducted at WRAIR (in vitro study) is a part of a joint collaborative research project with employees of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute  of Infectious Diseases.  The results of the WRAIR study will be compared directly with the study being carried out at USAMRIID (in vivo study).  Due to the extreme sensitivity to technical issues and in order to keep such technical variations to a minimum , the microarrray processing of the samples/slides will be processed by the same individuals at VBI for both sets of samples (from WRAIR and from USAMRIID). USAMRAA intends to award this contract modification under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A fir m-fixed-price type contract modification is planned.  The period of performance is dependent on approval of the Human Use Protocol by the Headquarters, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Commands Investigative Review Board.  A total of 50 more sample s will be processed.  Delivery will be scheduled after each sample is processed.  Interested respondents who feel that they are capable of meeting these requirements may identify their interest by submitting technical documentation and resumes demonstratin g capability to Dana Herndon at FAX No. 301-619-3002 by 30 May 2006.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>East Grand Forks Levee Stabilization, East Grand Forks, Minnesota.    Principle features of work include all plant, labor, materials and supplies required to remove approximately 900 linear feet of levee and native soils (approximately 169,000 cy), i nstall approximately 25,000 vertical wick drains (70 ft depth) below the levee footprint, install a sand drainage layer (7,000 cy - 1 ft thick), and then reconstruct the levee to elevation 830.  The levee would then be raised in 2 separate lifts to a final  design height of approximately 842. Raising the levee above elevation 830 will be done in stages as instrumentation will determine the amount of surcharge that can be placed.  Contract duration is estimated to be approximately 1 year but will ultimately b e determined through instrumentation as to when the final embankment placement can be made.  After final embankment placement, a bituminous recreational trail with a levee crossover (approx 2635 sy), topsoil, seeding, landscaping and 2 park benches will be  installed to complete the project.  This procurement is issued as a set-aside 8(a) competitive under the Small Business Demonstration Program (Public Law 100-656).  The procurement will be conducted using a Request for Proposal based on a lowest priced, t echnically acceptable format.  The technical acceptability criteria includes Execution Plan, Relevant Project Experience, and Past Performance.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 with the Small Business Size standar d of $31 million.  The estimated order of magnitude of construction in terms of physical characteristics and estimated price range is between $1 million and $5 million.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of National Marine Sanctuary, Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale has a requirement for analysis, outreach and administrative support for SPLASH.  Period of performance June 2006 through December 2006

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (HIHWNMS) was designated by Congress in 1992 to protect the humpback whale and its habitat in waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands.  Research coordination and outreach is a key component of the Sanctuary Program and is necessary to insure that research and management goals are met through grants, contracts, partnerships and simple articulation of Sanctuary research and management needs.  

HIHWNMS has played a central role in the design, coordination and funding of a three-year Pacific Ocean-wide survey of humpback whales called the SPLASH Project (Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance and Status of Humpbacks).  While HIHWNMS has been able to directly coordinate the project in Hawaii, it is not always in a position to be able to administer, coordinate and manage aspects of the project that are outside of its region (e.g. other regions and  countries).  It therefore needs assistance with the management of the aspects of the project that it can not do, or which would be carried out more efficiently by an NGO.

SCOPE OF WORK/OBJECTIVE

The work requires an organization with proven skills in coordinating humpback whale researchers and their data from a variety of sources, including from other countries.

The contract requires support in the following areas:

•	Coordination and management of the SPLASH project Steering Committee	
•	Assistance with SPLASH outreach.
•	Photo matching of Hawaiian fluke images to other regions
	

TASK REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall perform the technical support activities by developing and delivering the following:

Task 1. 	Coordination and management of the SPLASH project Steering Committee

The contractor will provide a central point of contact and coordination for the members of the SPLASH project Steering Committee.  These individuals are from various countries and agencies (Government, academic and private).   Activities within this task include:

•	Coordinate and report on Steering Committee meetings (2005 & 2006) and provide travel assistance to those members whose Institutions can not support their travel (as funds permit)
•	Provide a web site for efficient dissemination of information and documents that are of interest to the Steering Committee


Deliverable:  Contractor services as stated above.

Timeline:  8 weeks


Task 2.	Assistance with SPLASH project outreach

The Contractor will provide assistance to the HIHWNMS for outreach activities and projects which may otherwise be difficult for the Sanctuary to accomplish.  Activities within this task include:

•	Assist with logistics and content for the SPLASH symposium in Tokyo, Japan

Deliverable:  Contractor services as stated above.

Timeline:  2 weeks


Task 3.	Conduct photo matching of fluke images from Hawaii 2005 to images collected from the rest of the North Pacific during SPLASH (2004 & 2005)

The contractor will match images of humpback whale tail fluke patterns collected by researchers participating in the SPLASH project in Hawaiian waters during the winter season of 2005. 

•	Produce report summarizing the results of the matching, including a graphic representation of movements of Hawaiian whales re-identified in other locations

Deliverable:  Contractor services as stated above.

Timeline:  12 weeks


EQUIPMENT FURNISHED

The HIHWNMS shall provide a reconciled catalog of all images collected by HIHWNMS and its contractors during the 2005 winter season.  In addition, HIHWNMS will provide images and presentations for outreach activities.

<DESC>Congressional Research Service
        Statement of Work  for Graphic Design Support 


A.	BACKGROUND 

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is the public policy research arm of the United States Congress.  As a legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress, CRS works exclusively and directly for Members of Congress, their Committees and staff on confidential, nonpartisan basis.  The CRS staff comprises nationally recognized experts in a range of issues and disciplines, including law, economics, foreign affairs, public administration, social, political sciences, and natural sciences. 

Congress created CRS to serve its needs for nonpartisan and objective research and analysis of  legislative policy issues.  CRS provides timely, confidential, and authoritative research and analysis to Members, committees, and their staff.  CRS provides comprehensive support in foreign policy, economics, law, science, political science, and social policy.  CRS also covers the operations and procedures of both Chambers, legislative processes for the Federal budget and appropriations, and all constitutional issues including separation of powers, war powers, impeachment, and electoral procedures.

CRS analysts, attorneys, and information specialists work closely with Members and committees to explain policy problems, develop options and legislative proposals, conduct legal analysis of pending legislation, deliver testimony before congressional committees, prepare products on current legislative issues, write confidential memoranda, and provide personal consultations.  CRS  also conducts seminars on public policy and legal issues as well as training in the legislative and budget processes.

CRS has a requirement for graphic design support for several CRS products on a continuing basis.  The objective is to create or update materials using the existing CRS logo design and previously developed design themes and standards, so that they have a consistent look with existing materials and are engaging to congressional and CRS audiences. 

B.	SCOPE OF WORK 

CRS has been working on building a visual awareness with designs that are engaging, understated and elegant. This program is being administered by the Associate Director for Congressional Affairs and Counselor to the Director of the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. 

Our clients, congressional staff, have a high turn over rate compared to other industries.  In addition, they receive vast amounts of information daily and our products need designs that are both engaging and easily recognizable as a CRS product.

 
The objective of this contract is to create or update materials using the existing CRS logo design and previously developed design themes and standards (i.e. color palette and design elements) so that they have a consistent look with existing materials and are engaging to congressional and CRS audiences. 

C.  	REQUIREMENTS 

There are four requirements.

C1. 	The contractor or their representative must be in the local area (within 35 mile of the Library of Congress) and within the Library of Congress=s messenger service area.  

C2. 	Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment and facilities needed to produce the deliverables outlined in this contract.

C3. 	All final art work in digital form will be prepared on a Macintosh computer with a writable CD-Rom drive, using the listed version or higher of the following programs: Adobe Illustrator CS2, InDesign CS2, Photoshop CS2, Acrobat 6.0 and Quark Express 6.5.

C4. 	The contractor must have Adobe Caslon and Univers fonts.  Other supplies or expenses such as internal or external color proofs and comps, CDs or zip disks, local transportation, messenger service, overnight mail and copies are to be included as part of the contractor=s cost. 

D.  	PROCESS

The seven part process for each deliverable is as follows:

D1.	At the start of each project, the contractor will discuss the design options with CRS representatives (either at a meeting or a conference call, as decided by CRS).  The contractor=s representatives must include a principal of the firm or the proposed designer (this may be same person). The contractor shall be given a minimum of four day=s notice of initial meeting or conference call and three days= notice for an additional meeting or conference call, at the option of the Library.

D2.	The contractor will provide a detailed design and production schedule for each project.  For at least one project but no more than three projects during the contract, last minute design changes will have to be made due to changes in the congressional schedule. 

D3.	There will be at least four rounds of CRS review with CRS comments and changes incorporated into each round.  Included in the rounds of review are the initial creative concepts and layout reviews as follows:

!	submission of three initial creative concepts with folding paper comps as appropriate, accompanied by PMS chips and recommended paper samples
!	revision of creative concepts
!	Two to three rounds of layout review and revisions.

D4.	All text for designs will either be given to the contractor/designer in WordPerfect format,  in the text of an email, or via fax.
 
D5.	Photography, when used, will be a combination of CRS supplied photos, stock photos, and new photography from contractor/designer managed photo shoots.


D6.	 The contractor/designer will prepare a final release printing package.  It will include two copies of each of the following: 

!	GPO form 952 including printing specifications and file list
!	hard copy markups with screen percentages marked (not color separations) and folding comps

Sidoti, ASC/YTJG anthony.sidoti@wpafb.af.mil 1970 Monahan Way Bldg 11A Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 Commercial (937) 904-4242 DSN 674-4242 _________________________________________________ 3 June 2004 Update - Response date corrected to reflect 5 July 2004.  All  responses to this document are requested NLT 5 July 2004. _________________________________________________ The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson  AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to  perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS)  Contractor Logistics Support  (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 Jan  2007. BACKGROUND GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon  Aircraft Corporation as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS  CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The  GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the  maximum student and instructor training load at each training site The GBTS has  three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and  the Training Integration Management System (TIMS). There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training  operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students  normal and emergency procedures as defined in the JPPT syllabus.  All three  utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full  functioning replica of the T-6A front seat cockpit and the same Instructor  Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC  computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing  system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the  devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device  (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33  degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.   Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 Visual Control Computer  and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.   The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five. The other two ATD's are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and  include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer  (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning  instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that  replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of  the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection  procedures.   A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been  properly initiated. The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their  associated syllabi.  The T-6A Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6A  Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how  to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using  Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate  training platforms. TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying  training programs (T-6A, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates  on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.   Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application  server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual  Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).   CURRENT ENVIRONMENT RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components. On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and  NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required  manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of  95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.   The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy  location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes  Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are  tracked using Magic Service Desk. On-Site TIMS CAI support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB,  Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for  the CAI labs and a helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters  trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration,  etc.). Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740 Moody AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 709 Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328 Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268 Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672 Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320 Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System  (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS  locations.  The MUSS supports: ATD software and visual database maintenance Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus  Management) Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and  distribution TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location) Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location) FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS The required support will be no less than the support described in the current  environment above.  Simulator data associated with T-6A aircraft drawings may  not be available to the follow-on contractor.  Support will be required to  integrate T-6A and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS  support will be performed at CMM level 3 or equivalent.  The contract type is  anticipated to be fixed price with T+M for travel and spares for TIMS and CAI  labs, but the Government is open to suggestions concerning contract types. Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability  and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of: 1.  Simulator support 2.  Courseware support 3.  Training management systems and IT systems administration 4.  Software certification level 5.  Undergraduate flying training Sources that could provide portions of this support are invited to respond with  information that does not cover the entire program. Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes  only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be  construed as a commitment by the Government.

There will be no limit to the amount paid on individual task orders and no limit on project size; however, the total cumulative task order amount shall not exceed $3,000,000 in any one-year contract period.  Projects, while there will be no limit on size, will generally involve repairs, alterations, and improvements in connection with existing construction cost.  A/E firms will be evaluated in terms of their professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, specialized experience and technical competence in the fields of energy conservation, pollution prevention waste reduction, the use of recovered materials and services regarding asbestos related work.  

Selection criteria for this acquisition are listed below in descending order of importance:  (1) Experience:  Experience of the firm and consultants with regard to providing the types of services described above, and with regard to accomplishment of past projects including repair and alteration work.  (2) Management and Inspection Capability:  Experience and capability of the firm and consultants with respect to complete management and inspection services for projects of the type described above during the construction phase.  (3) Technical Ability:  Professional qualifications, expertise and education level of individuals employed by the firm and consultants who will be directly involved in providing the above described services and their philosophy concerning the design of repair and alteration work.  (4) Management/Organization/Production/Quality Control:  Producing a high quality design, maintaining good working relationships, working with repair and alteration projects, meeting schedules, providing accurate cost estimates, and tracking and controlling costs.  (5) Geographical Boundaries: Demonstrate that at least 35 percent of the A/E contract services (based on total contract price) will be accomplished within the primary geographical boundaries of Texas Zone IV for the resulting contract.  

The Government will not indemnify the firm against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials, that is, no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the contract.  A Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating FFP task orders.  A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing task orders for projects with an estimated construction cost of less than $2,000,000 will be included in the contract.  The Government will use the fixed price amount in the lookup table which will be a function of project size, type, and complexity.  The lookup table will be provided to the A/E during initial contract negotiations.

Firms, when responding to this announcement, should address their capability with regard to each of the evaluation factors listed above, as the top rated firms recommended for interview will be recommended solely on their written response to this announcement.  Architectural or engineering firms wishing to be considered must submit 3 copies of completed Standard Form (SF) 330 and other pertinent information (see FAR 53.236-2(b)).  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.

<DESC>Solicitation HSTS02-06-R-TTC166 is cancelled per the TSA Announcement on 11 May 06 by TSA Public Affairs for an Open Competition of the Integrated TWIC Solution. Pursuant to Secretary Chertoff's accelerated port security initiatives, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is following up on its announcement yesterday of the proposed rulemaking for the Transportation Worker Identity Card (TWIC) with a revised procurement process intended to provide the most effective integrated security process for our nation’s seaports. TSA will conduct a competition for one integrated solution for all aspects of the TWIC implementation. TSA intends to issue a new solicitation in the coming days for TWIC enrollment services and the operations of the data management system (IDMS), including system maintenance. This will streamline the contracting and implementation process by identifying one party as the lead in making sure that all the pieces fit together into an effective, integrated security process. TSA has assessed different business models for TWIC implementation, and based on a full review of total system timeframe, risk and cost, has decided to go forward with a single integrator model.

<DESC>Congressional Research Service (CRS) Document Conversion
Request for Information (RFI)

A. Background

The Congressional Research Service (CRS), a service unit of the Library of Congress (LOC), works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing research, analysis, and information support to the members and committees of the House of Representatives and Senate.  More than 400 analysts author written reports and confidential memoranda, conduct educational seminars and workshops, and provide in-person briefings and telephone consultations.  CRS staff members work directly with the Congress on a daily basis to help elected members and their staff identify, analyze, and formulate legislative proposals. CRS experts perform in-depth policy, legal, and procedural analyses; identify and assess policy alternatives and implications; assist in framing legislative proposals; identify and evaluate new research findings, data, and information sources; and deliver testimony before congressional committees. CRS staff also provide the Congress with a wide range of specialized reference and information services.

CRS produces Reports to Congress using WordPerfect 12.  These reports are published in print, PDF, and HTML using WordPerfect macros that convert the documents from their native WordPerfect format.  CRS currently maintains about 6,000 Reports to Congress on its internal website.  Many of these reports are updated on a regular basis, sometimes daily, to reflect changes in the status of the legislative issues under consideration. Approximately 850 new reports are issued each year, and approximately 20 reports are updated each day.  Reports include text, extensive footnotes, tables, and vector graphic images.

B. Current Need

CRS currently requires expert advice for planning purposes on how to convert up to 6,000 Reports to Congress from WordPerfect 12 to Microsoft (MS) Word 2003, including an estimate of the cost, time frame, and a suggested approach to the proposed conversion.  CRS estimates that the 6,000 reports contain 120,000 total pages.  CRS may choose to convert 3,000 products, or all 6,000 reports in its collection.  CRS estimates that 3,000 of its reports are updated on a regular basis.  CRS must continue to update these reports, even during a conversion process.  CRS estimates that 3,000 of its reports are not actively updated; these 3,000 non-updated reports, however, remain available to Congress through the CRS website. 

C.  Disclaimer

The purpose of this RFI is to inform CRS of the options and issues to consider should it choose to convert CRS reports from WordPerfect to MS Word.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to this RFI are not offers, and cannot be accepted to form a binding contract.   


D. Scope

For planning purposes, CRS seeks information from the industry to assist in identifying options and considerations involved in converting up to 6,000 CRS Reports to Congress from WordPerfect 12 to MS Word 2003. CRS estimates that 3,000 of its reports are not actively updated.  These reports, which may remain in WordPerfect, may fall outside the scope of the project or may be converted by CRS with a conversion tool on an as-needed basis.  CRS memoranda and other written material are also not within the scope of the conversion project.

CRS reports range from two pages to more than 100 pages in length, with a typical length of 20 pages.  As many as 120,000 pages may be part of the conversion effort. The reports make heavy use of footnotes; employ bold and italicized text and other standard editorial features; and feature extensive tables and graphics created in WordPerfect or imported from other programs, such as Excel or Quattro Pro.  Paragraphs are not currently tagged elements in the data. 

Reports authored in WordPerfect use two WordPerfect templates that draw upon a series of WordPerfect styles and macros to output two CRS report formats, a short and long report.  The new MS Word system will use a single MS Word template and a combination of Word styles, XML elements, and Smart document technology to create and output a single report format. A list of WordPerfect elements to be mapped to the new MS Word elements will be available before conversion begins. Two examples follow.

First, in WordPerfect, five levels of headings may be used in the reports.  Each level is identified with a WordPerfect style. In MS Word, four levels of headings may be used in the reports. Each level is identified with a MS Word style. Long reports, over half of the reports, include tables of contents that are automatically generated from the heading level styles. During conversion and the change to a single report format, all reports will include a table of contents. Long reports, which included tables of contents, will retain the tables of contents for display during output to HTML, PDF, and print while those without tables of contents will not do so.

Second, in WordPerfect, CRS reports link to external websites and  congressional bills, U.S. public laws, House and Senate reports, and other CRS reports using custom WordPerfect styles to identify the material being linked.  For publication to HTML, PDF, and print, a post-processor identifies the “tagged” material and converts it to corresponding HTML anchor (<a href>) tags based on a simple algorithm. MS Word will use Word ML enhanced with a custom XML schema and embedded Smart Tags to identify and link to congressional bills, U.S. public laws, House and Senate reports, and other CRS reports.

The following materials will be supplied to respondents upon request: a list of the styles used in WordPerfect; a preliminary list of styles to be used in MS Word; a preliminary mapping of WordPerfect elements to MS Word elements; the preliminary XML schema imported into and then applied to the MS Word template; the preliminary, draft, custom MS Word template (“CRSReport.dot”) file; and sample WordPerfect versions of CRS Reports to Congress in electronic format. Vendors may request this information from the contracting officer listed at the end of this RFI. Information shared with respondents shall be considered confidential; a signed non-disclosure agreement will be required.

E. Special Concerns

CRS reports are updated on a daily basis; thus CRS authors will need immediate access to their reports for updating in WordPerfect, even during all stages of the conversion process.  More than 400 authors write and update the CRS reports. Approximately 20 reports are updated each day.  New reports are added to the collection at the rate of approximately 15 new reports per week. Legislative developments and current events determine which reports need to be updated; as a result, it is impossible to determine which reports will need to be updated during any conversion process.  CRS commits to updating reports within days or even hours of relevant events. 

CRS is developing a new report format that will differ from the two existing report formats.  CRS currently has a short report format and a long report format.   Converted documents will need to fit a new report structure that is currently being developed.  The current format for short and long reports is relatively unstructured while the new report format is structured and establishes tags for relevant data elements.  (For example, the heading levels established for CRS documents currently are inconsistently used.  Some documents may start with a level-two heading, or may have a level-three heading following and nested under a level-one heading.  In the new report format, heading levels will need to be used in a consistent order.)

CRS plans to make report title and author names consistent with an authoritative database. CRS reports contain the title of the report, the author or authors names, and job title. The current WordPerfect files do not always contain the authoritative data for these elements.  CRS maintains a database that contains the authoritative information.  That information will need to be merged with and imported into the converted documents.

Graphics are often created outside of WordPerfect documents and imported in a variety of ways.  Graphics software programs used include: Excel, Quattro Pro, Harvard Graphics, and Adobe Illustrator, among others.  Files are frequently cut and pasted into WordPerfect or input as a Windows Metafile.  Graphics are also updated — approximately 1,200 graphic files are imbedded in the total 6,000 reports.

Quality assurance is of utmost concern.  CRS will output print, PDF, and HTML versions of the Word files and make them directly available to Congress with only minimal in-house quality assurance.  CRS documents must convert to print, PDF, and HTML using in-house output tools with a very high accuracy rate.  Dropped data, incorrect spacing, incorrect formatting (such as incorrect use of styles, or failure to follow the original indentations within reports), and failure to follow the established style sheet provided for each report format are considered unacceptable.  CRS is writing programs that will output the MS Word files into the print, PDF, and HTML formats.

CRS seeks greater consistency in the presentation of its tables.  Tables in WordPerfect documents are either created directly in WordPerfect or imported from other programs such as Excel.  Standards for these tables have been loosely enforced in WordPerfect.  The Word environment will require that tables meet specific standards (such as right justification of numbers, left justification of words and phrases).  It is expected that much of the work of enforcing the new look for CRS tables will require manual reformatting of tables to meet new specifications.



F.  Information Responses

CRS seeks a project plan, an estimated cost, and an estimated timeline that will allow CRS to assess a possible conversion project.  In the project plan, CRS requests that respondents provide the following information:

Section 1.  Project Plan

Briefly describe the options available to CRS to convert the WordPerfect files to Word.  Address the following questions in your response.  Responses should not be limited to these questions; respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.
 
	&#9679;	What are options for converting documents that are updated regularly and what are notable strengths and weaknesses?

	&#9679;	What quality assurance steps can a contractor provide to ensure that documents do not lose any text, formatting, or other unique features during the conversion? What level of quality assurance should CRS expect of contractors?

	&#9679;	What level of quality assurance may still be required by CRS personnel?  What skill set will be required by CRS personnel?

	&#9679;	What strategies are recommended to implement Word? Can CRS launch Word for use by all 400 analysts for updating all documents simultaneously?  If so, what efforts may be required by either an outside vendor or CRS personnel to handle documents that are in the process of being converted to Word, or are already converted to Word but are concurrently updated in WordPerfect?

	&#9679;	What other issues should CRS consider?


Section 2.  Challenges

Briefly describe the challenges that CRS may face during the conversion.  What steps must CRS complete before attempting a conversion.

Section 3.  Time and Cost

Provide cost estimates for each of the two alternatives CRS is considering: 1) converting 3,000 documents (approximately 60,000 pages); or 2) converting 6,000 documents (approximately 120,000 pages).  Discuss how the total cost was generally determined, and what factors the industry generally considers to estimate cost (by page, file, characters, or other factor)?  CRS also requests estimated costs for a conversion tool that would allow CRS to convert documents that were not part of the initial conversion effort on as as-needed basis.

Provide a time estimate for the project.  Address how much time would be required to convert 3,000 documents (approximately 60,000 pages); or convert 6,000 documents (approximately 120,000 pages).

After a narrative explanation, include a table that details the time and cost for each of the two alternatives (e.g,  X months and Y dollars for 1,500 documents, or other measures, as appropriate).  Separately, list the cost to provide CRS a conversion tool for its use.  Identify any significant limitations or impediments to making time and cost estimates.

G. Administrative Issues

Requests should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.)

Question: 	In QUESTION #4, Load Flow and Short Circuit Studies. These calculations will be difficult for us to perform for the following reasons.
a)  The budget allocated for the feasibility study is not sufficient to carry out system studies. 
b)  We do not know in what format the System Data is available and we have no forecast data. Without this information and the one line diagram it is difficult to even estimate the effort that will be required to do the system studies.
c)  NEGK has all the system data and demand forecast along with the system model. We also understand that NEGK has already completed preliminary system studies in order to select the proposed substations and transmission line links.
d)  It is therefore our opinion that NEGK should carry out the System Studies using the NEGK software system is modeled.  We will review the studies and provide input on the case that we believe need to be analyzed so that the results can be used in the designs of substation and transmission lines.
Answer: The contractor should execute calculation of loading flow and short circuit studies.  NEGK is ready to provide all necessary data for performance of calculations. All this is necessary to specify a choice of section of wires and to prove the necessity of construction of 220 kV lines under the project.

Question: In QUESTION # 8, Geotechnical Studies, Terms of Reference require test pits which means soil borings and soil test. Our interpretation of your response is that test pits are not required and that the objective is to identify and avoid geologically unstable areas of the route in order to minimize risks from mudslides, landslides and flooding. Please clarify.
Answer: The contractor should perform these works. On complicated sites of lines such research should be executed selectively for acknowledgement of a geological substantiation of lines, and on the site of 500 kV S/S - carrying out of such research is obligatory.

Question: In QUESTION # 9, Drawings; Please clarify the following:
a)  What data is available to generate the Plan and Profile Drawings?
b)  What information shall be shown on the plan and profile drawings. Do the plan and profiles should show tower spotting? (location of towers and conductors).
Answer: a)  NEGK has dates of OH/TL 220 kV visual survey in scale 1õ100000.
b) Plans and longitudinal profile should contain the arrangement of towers. Please find attached the sample of a longitudinal profile with some of the necessary information, which should be specified on drawings.

7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:
A)	Program Description

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia has responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics. This program is directed at supporting a program of policy reform, economic recovery, democratic and social transition in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Within the USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia the Office of Health and Education (HE) has the primary responsibility for management of assistance in the social sectors, primarily health reform, prevention and control of infectious diseases, and maternal, child, and reproductive health.  USAID/HE serves as the primary point of communication on these sectors with the governments of the five Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan); five U.S. Embassies in Central Asia; non-governmental organizations (indigenous, U. S., international); other donors and private commercial entities. USAID is funding activities in public health care reform (which includes health financing, policy, and systems reform); infectious disease prevention and control (tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and avian influenza); and maternal, child, and reproductive health.  

USAID/CAR’s strategic objective in health is: Increased utilization of quality primary health care in selected populations.  This objective is achieved through four intermediate results: (1) select populations are better informed about personal health care rights and responsibilities; 
(2) improved quality of health care including infectious diseases and maternal and child health; (3) improved use of health care resources for primary health care and (4) improved legislative, regulatory and policy framework. 

A major challenge in the region is to a) restructure the public health sector to focus on primary health care; b) reduce the burden of disease caused by infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, acute respiratory infection, diarrheal diseases, hepatitis, etc; and c) improve the quality of primary health care services to address the high mortality and morbidity caused by diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer and other lifestyle related diseases which are observed in more developed countries.  

B)	STATEMENT OF DUTIES

<DESC>CBP REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: TRANSPORT/CARRIER SUPPORT FOR TRANSPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES FROM UP-FITTER LOCATIONS TO SECTORS/STATIONS WITH RETURN TRIPS

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
 
The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking industry interest and information to establish and maintain a transportation process to deliver completed vehicles from CBP vehicle up-fitters to our sectors/stations and other selected locations as well as delivering law enforcement vehicles from CBP sector/stations and other selected locations based on CBP requirements.  

Minimum Requirements:
Provide a current copy of the Certificate of Insurance 
Proof of: Carrier Insurance
Cargo Insurance 
DOT rating of Satisfactory
Ability to provided Bonded Drivers
If operated through Brokers, complete listing of registered agents
Brief carrier history including all prior names of the company (Doing Business As)
Dunn and Bradstreet rating if available or a financial statement (CPA endorsed)
Provide a copy of the DOT “Safer” report

Objective:
There is a need to provide CBP with a national, or a partnership with a co-op of regional transportation services. This carrier(s) will provide service from our vehicle up-fitter locations to our sectors, stations and other identified locations within the contiguous 48 states and possible delivery to CBP Caribbean Area, Hawaii and Alaska. There is also the need to provide transportation from the previously mentioned locations back to CBP up-fitters or directly to an after-market auction house for disposal.

Scope:
It is the responsibility of the carrier/transporter to secure the vehicles in a safe manner that complies with the DOT regulations of transporting vehicles. It is also the responsibility of the carrier/transporter to provide accurate and live-time data as to the status of the delivery and/or pickup of the vehicles. The carrier/transporter is required to provide all relevant documentation for the transporting of the vehicles. The carrier will also need operating authority in all states. In isolated instances it may be required to provide services or to partner with another carrier/transporter for deliveries to CBP Caribbean Area, Hawaii and Alaska.

The carrier will provide customer service as it relates to communication, scheduling and planning for vehicle delivery or pickup from the up fitter to the previously identified locations.

The carrier must provide a sample timeline for picking up our vehicles from the up fitter to the final destination and a timeline from the sector/station back to the up fitter. 
Sample locations (Zip Codes) to build the required timelines are: up fitter-Texas, 78602; Sectors/Stations- Del Rio 78840, El Centro 92243, El Paso 79925, Laredo 78045, Marfa 79843, Houlton 04730, Detroit 48045, Tucson 85713, Atlanta 30349, Chicago 60607, Houston 77019, LA 90831, Miami 33131.

The carrier will be subject to random audits conducted by CBP or a representative of CBP to ensure accuracy and review any historical data of the transporting of these vehicles.

CBP will consider an option whereby the carrier removes parts (when returning vehicles), to allow transport of the maximum amount, in order to achieve the most cost effective operation.  However, if this is performed the carrier/transporter must provide trained personnel to perform these tasks to minimize damage to the vehicle and provide documentation tracking and identifying the removed part(s). 

Assumptions:

<DESC>Medicare Outpatient End Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System.  

Under FAR 6.302-1(2), The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract effective September 11, 2006, to the Regents of the University of Michigan, Division of Research and Development and Administration, Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center, 503 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109.  This will be a 12 month contract with 4 option years.  The Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the requirements.    

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is responsible for the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prospective Payment System (PPS).  Under the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), Section 623 of the law contained a number of ESRD related provisions that implement section 1881(b) of the Act.  Section 623(d)(1) required that a basic case mix adjusted composite rate be established reflecting a limited number of patient characteristics (case mix adjustments), adjustments that reflected differences in payment for separately billed drugs, revised pricing based on acquisition costs and geographic and budget neutrality adjustment factors.  In addition to changes in the existing composite rate, section 623(f) required a report to Congress that details the elements and features for the design of a fully bundled ESRD PPS.       

The services required for this project focus on the continuance of updating, using the most recent CMS administrative data, the analytic files for all available hospital based and freestanding ESRD facilities.  It also focuses on the addition of two newly collected variables: height and weight, and expansion reporting of diagnostic conditions.  This updated data system will be used for refinement and to develop and assess the impact of the basic case mix adjusted ESRD PPS.        

In addition, this data base, previous analysis, modeling and assessments will be built upon to support CMS in the development of a fully bundled case mix adjusted PPS for the ESRD PPS.  These analyses, models and reports will be used to support the Centers for Medicare Management’s efforts to prepare a Report to Congress that will detail the design, present alternative and implications for a fully bundled ESRD PPS.      

For the performance of work requirements for these systems the following skills must be demonstrated: (1) analysis, research, modeling, simulation, impact analysis and manipulation of large data bases; (2) the overall skill of contextual analysis, i.e. the ability to analyze information using accepted research methodologies to respond to the context (timing, previous research and special studies and current strategic environment) for the project; (3) ability to create large data CMS data bases, and analyze these using acceptable statistical and research related models and methods; (4) personnel having a number of available skills that include: statisticians (mathematical and survey statisticians), economists, research methodologists, programmers, analysts, system analysts, and individuals with clinical skills, e.g. nephrologists with both a treatment and comobidity focus; (4) previous work with prospective payment systems, including technical, as well as clinical (e.g. comorbid conditions) professionals; (5) assessment of the current context, analyze and synthesize research needs, and develop analytic plans to address PPS systems in general, but specifically the ESRD PPS; (6) implementation of this plan in a timely, valid and reliable manner using appropriate statistical and research methods and techniques; (7) the ability to communicate, verbally and in writing; (8) presentation of analysis of large data sets, technical analysis, clinical findings, and the preparation of final reports and special studies of a quality suitable for publication is essential; (9) assurance that methods, findings and recommendations are available to CMS and can be made available to industry, other governmental agencies and interested groups.         

The Government will consider interest expressed within 15 calendar days of publication of notice.  Written requests should be submitted to Gina Romano, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, 7500 Security Boulevard, C2-21-15, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850.  E-mail address: Gina.Romano@cms.hhs.gov.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.

The DRUH contains electronic components that are no longer in production. The repair/upgrade will be in accordance with MIL-PRF-71185.  The obsolescence identificat ion and tracking requirement will support the need for the government to determine the supportability of the DRUH and plan for its eventual redesign or replacement. The Government does not own the technical data package for the DRUH, which was produced by Honeywell, Incorporated.  Currently, Honeywell repairs the DRUH. Firms that can perform the DRUH obsolescence study are encouraged to identify themselves to the contract specialist or contracting office and indicate if the firm is large, small, or small di sadvantaged. This is a market survey/sources sought synopsis for information only and shall not be construed to be a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the  basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The Government is interested in prime contractors only.

<SUBJECT>R -- OMB Circular A-76 Cost Competition Announcement
<DESC>This is an announcement that US HHS/AHRQ is conducting a Standard Competition in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government "in-house" operations to contractor operations. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the following services and related functions performed by Government personnel and current contract support to other contract performance will be conducted. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The competition will include those services that are currently performed by Federal and contract employees in Rockville, MD at the AHRQ headquarters facility, as well as services currently performed off-site by the incumbent contract support units. Approximately 32 Full Time Equivalent positions and 40 Contract Equivalent Man- years (CME) are affected by this competition.  The FAIR Act functions represented include:  D705, D706, H010, R140, T000, W310, W601, Y515, and Y820.

The Agency intends to solicit proposals under a Low Price – Technically Acceptable Source Selection Pocess.  The proposed price of the low cost offeror of those determined to have demonstrated a technically acceptable approach to meeting all PWS service and workload requirements at the documented quality and timeliness standards will be compared to the cost of the Government workforce’s Agency Tender.

Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 3.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS:
Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms slated as most highly qualified.  Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain management and design team components, QC process; and to provide design solutions to actual/hypothetical projects, etc.  Elaborate presentations are not desired.  Site visits will not be arranged during this period.  Debriefing requests will not be entertained prior to 45 days after the submittal due date.

<DESC>The Navy requires technical support to further develop/upgrade the ESS module.  In 1996, the Defense Environmental Security Corporate Information Management (DESCIM) Program Management Office (PMO) embarked on an effort to identify and migrate appropriate software systems to the target solution known as the Defense Explosives Safety Management Suite (DESMS).  DESMS consists of five distinct software modules that ultimately will function together as one seamless system.  One module is Explosives Safety Siting (ESS) module.  The Service Subject Matter Experts published an Integration Decision Paper (IDP) addressing the state-of-the-art for automated site planning and recommending migration towards the ESS applications.  Subsequently they published an ESS System/Subsystem Specification (SSS) during 1998.  These documents were updated resulting in an approved ESS System Decision Paper (SDP) dated January 2003.  The ESS System Accreditation for Version 5.0 was approved in May 2003.  Scope of Work.  This effort is to upgrade the ESS software to make it compatible with the current information systems technology.  The upgraded system must be compatible with Microsoft Windows technology (e.g.. Active-X Data Objects, graphical user interface standards) so it can be used on ESS user community workstations.  Also compatibility with Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) geographic information systems (GIS) technology is necessary to interface with the GIS applications used by the host military installation mapping systems.  Finally, the ESS architecture must be flexible so the software can be configured to meet the local information system operating environments.  This flexibility is achieved by implementing the n-tier architecture concepts so ESS can be configured as a very thick client (personal workstation), thick client (client-server), or as a thin client (web browser).  The scope is to lay the foundation for this architecture, while focusing on the personal workstation and enterprise client-server modes.  The current version of ESS will be used as the prototype.  The database model contains configuration, code, algorithm control, map feature, and administrative data tables.  The software contains data retrieval and update procedures, explosives safety business rules and procedures, system interface procedures and user interface procedures.  The database /software are the fundamental documentation for the current capability of the application.  User/training manuals, and development historical documents supplement the fundamental documentation.  This prototype clearly defines the functional requirements for the new version.  The new version of ESS shall maintain the functionality of the prototype while updating its information technology and processing efficiency and reliability.  The ESRI Geodatabase technology shall be implemented so ESS can use this technology in a personal or enterprise mode.  The latest version of the ESRI ArcObjects component will be used for the GIS engine and the spatial analysis engine.  The Microsoft .NET Framework (i.e. Visual Basic .NET, ADO.NET, Fortran.NET, etc.) shall be used.  The system shall also be capable of using the commonly used relational data base engines.  It must use Microsoft Access, Oracle, and SQL Server via ADO.NET (versions are identified in paragraph 7).  The user interface shall conform to the Microsoft Windows standard.  This means the functionality of the forms and controls must be compatible with the user experience associated with Microsoft products (e.g. Word, Excel, etc.)  The Visual Basic .NET controls are expected to be adequate to accomplishing this user experience objective.  Documents produced by ESS (e.g. text, graphic, tabular) shall be compatible with other applications (e.g. Microsoft Word and Excel, AutoCAD).  Potential MapObjects reverse compatibility strategy is required.  Compatibility is accomplished using a setup/install procedure option or an alternate method approved by the government.  The intent is to optionally install ESS so it will use dynamic link libraries associated with ESRI MapObjects rather than ArcObjects.  The focus  is only the use of ArcObjects dynamic link libraries.  However, the current source code revision shall be accomplished in a manner that will facilitate extending, when required, the source code to support optionally using MapObjects dynamic link libraries.  With this feature, one version of the source can be maintained while providing for installing either an ArcObjects or a MapObjects version.   Reference to ArcObjects in this document implies providing appropriate features to support this MapObjects option.  Maintainability of the new version is critical.  The prototype version shall be analyzed to identify procedures that can be encapsulated more rigorously.  The result will be code, including queries, which can be modified without degrading the application.  Additional software engineering approaches to achieving a robust maintainability objective are encouraged.  The new version of ESS shall include upgrades of all components necessary to compile and create executable applications.  The ESRI ArcObjects and Microsoft ADO.NET components have previously been specified.  Additional components are used to create the prototype.  All components shall be upgraded if appropriate upgrades exist.  Alternatively, while maintaining the functionality of the new version (e.g. documents produced) new technology can be substituted with the approval of the government.  The Generic Base data set will be used during development and for final acceptance.  Solutions produced with ESS version 6.0 will be compared to solutions produced by the prototype.  The quality of the two solutions shall be comparable.  The contractor shall continue the evolution of ESS to target solution version 6.0.  To do this the contractor shall provide a fixed level-of-effort support.  NFESC will reserve the right to focus the contractor’s efforts as necessary.  The delivery schedule for this work is seven (7) months after award.  Any other interested party, other than incumbent contractors, must submit their interest by 17 May 2006 of their capability to meet this schedule and for additional information.  The Point of Contact is:  Naomi Melendez, Contract Specialist, telephone 202-685-8051, fax: 1788, and email: naomi.melendez@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to establish a Commercial Purchase Order for one year, not to exceed $50,000.00 for commercial engineering consulting services that will require a contractor to perform evaluation of technical approaches to Ch emical Warfare Materiel (CWM) responses at FUDS, and issues to report describing community acceptance and concerns, and is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 for commercial services.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitat ion; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quote is W912DY-06-Q-0047. Quotes are due 16 May 2006, 11:00 a.m. CST. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect t hrough Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 01-26.  The applicable North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541620, and the business size standard is 6.0 Million.    STATEMENT OF WORK  COMMUNITY ACCEPTANCE EVALUATION CHEMICAL WARFARE MATERIEL REMEDIAL TECHNOLOGY  25 April 2006 1.  BACKGROUND.  	The US Army Corps of Engineers manages munitions responses (e.g., detection, recovery, and disposal of unexploded ordnance (UXO), discarded military munitions (DMM), and munitions constituents (MC) at formerly used defense sites (FUDS) across the U.S.  A subset of FUDS are known or suspected to contain munitions containing chemical agent (CA), and/or CA in other than munitions configurations (e.g., glass vials) often referred to as Chemical Agent Identification Sets (CAIS).  Collectively, this material is referred to as Chemical Warfare Materiel (CWM.  Munitions responses designed to address the explosive and CA hazards associated with CWM at these CWM sites must be conducted per applicable laws and regulations, including CERCLA and the National Contingency  Plan (NCP).   	An important aspect the NCP is meaningful community involvement during the decision-making process.  As part of that process, the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)  is evaluating potential community accept ance of various approaches to the disposal of various categories of CWM.  This study is programmatic in nature, and not linked to any specific FUDS that is a CWM site.  2.  OBJECTIVE. 	The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is for the Contractor to evaluate currently existing technological approaches to CWM response at FUDS, and issue a report describing community acceptance of, or concerns with, these approaches.  This evaluatio n is to focus on CWM (i.e., munitions with CA fills and CWM containers) that present explosive or CA hazards.  It will not address response technologies to address either environmental hazards associated with CA-contaminated environmental media, where the CA does not present such hazards, or CA degradation by-products. 3.  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. 	3.1  	(Task 1)  Technology Identification.  This is a firm fixed-price task.  The Contractor shall, at a minimum, identify and describe technologies or approaches that may reasonably be considered by DoD for use during CWM responses at FUDS CWM sites.  T hese technologies will include, but may not be limited to the below.   "	On-Site Destruction using the Explosives Disposal System (EDS), Rapid Response System (RRS), and/or Single CAIS Agent Neutralization System (SCANS) "	On-Site Destruction using controlled detonation technology "	Off-Site Destruction in existing chemical demilitarization destruction facilities "	Off-Site Destruction in Commercial Hazardous Waste Incineration Facilities "	LITANS (drill and drain)  "	In-Place Open Detonation of items deemed too hazardous to move by EOD.   "	Use of VCS versus evacuation of persons in populated areas. 	3.2. 	(Task 2) Evaluate Community Acceptance.  This is a firm fixed-price task.  The contractor shall identify and evaluate likely community acceptance or concerns associated with each of th e technological approaches identified under Task 1.  For this study Community Acceptance is defined using the NCP's nine alternative analysis criteria (see 300 CFR 430).   The Contractor shall not attempt to link use of any specific technology with any s pecific current or future CWM site, but may elect to evaluate overall community acceptance, partially as a function of demographic variables that may change from CWM site to CWM site. 	3.3.	(Task 3)  Chemical Agent Identification Set Sites.  This is a firm fixed-price task.  The Contractor shall evaluate community/regulatory acceptance of using an education program as the sole response at locations where Chemical Agent Identification S ets (CAIS) were shipped for use in training, but none have been found.  The assumption for this study is that all CAIS shipped to such locations were, as designed, expended in training.  (Note: There is no technology available to detect glass vials associa ted with CAIS that may remain, and there are no known or suspected CAIS burial sites.)  	3.4.	(Task 4)  Prepare Report.  This is a firm fixed-price task.  The Contractor shall prepare and submit a report that fully documents the findings of the study required by this SOW.  The report shall include text, tables, photographs, and figures as ne cessary.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program plans to enter into a contract for the drafting of Clinical Trials Agreements (CTAs), Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) and Materials Transfer Agreements (MTAs).  The North American Industry Classification code is 541990, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Background

The mission of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) is to improve the lives of cancer patients by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. CTEP accomplishes this mission by funding an extensive national program of cancer research and by sponsoring clinical trials to evaluate new anti-cancer agents, with a particular emphasis on translational research to elucidate molecular targets and mechanisms of drug effects.

Purpose

The Agreement Coordination Group of the Regulatory Affairs Branch of CTEP is responsible for the preparation and execution of all agreements for the non-clinical and clinical development of agents that are in the CTEP portfolio. This includes all clinical collaborative agreements such as Clinical Trials Agreements (CTAs) and Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) as well as all Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) for non-clinical studies. A high priority program within CTEP is the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program and this Group is responsible for negotiating and executing all of the MTAs to support this Program with the pharmaceutical companies and the participating institutions. The Group also negotiates and executes the confidentiality agreements for the initial meetings with potential collaborators and is responsible for coordinating all collaborator interactions with CTEP.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for professional, scientific, and technical services prepared in accordance with the FAR Part 13.105.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The procurement and solicitation are being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ)with the following solicitation number 2006-Q-31762 amendment. The solicitation documents, incorporated provisions, and clauses in effect through the Federal Action Circular2005-04, dated June 8, 2005 are hereby incorporated in this RFQ.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a requirement for a vendor to conduct telephone interviews in Puerto Rico with adult persons from a list provided by the Dengue Branch and from controls matched by municipality of residence and selected by random digit telephone dialing. The telephone interviews will collect information regarding symptoms experiences during the convalescent phase of a dengue infection. A questionnaire will be provided to the vendor by the Dengue Branch. The vendor is preferred to be from Puerto Rico; see “Minimum vendor qualifications.”

BACKGROUND AND PROJECT OVERVIEW:  

Dengue is a vector-borne febrile disease of the tropics transmitted most often by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Symptoms of the acute disease include fever, headache, rash, retro-orbital pain, myalgias, arthralgias, vomiting, abdominal pain and hemorrhagic manifestations. Many symptoms are mentioned in the medical literature as associated with the convalescent period (3-8 weeks) after dengue infection, including depression, dementia, loss of sensation, paralysis of lower and upper extremities and larynx, epilepsy, tremors, manic psychosis, amnesia, loss of visual acuity, hair loss, and peeling of skin. No epidemiologic study has been conducted to define the timing, frequency, and risk factors for these symptoms. The objective of this study is to examine the incidence and characteristics of mental health disorders and other delayed complications associated with dengue infection and convalescence. The study will be conducted in Puerto Rico, where dengue is endemic and causes severe sporadic epidemics. 

PURPOSE OF WORK:  

The purpose of this procurement is to acquire information on the symptoms experienced by dengue cases as a result of their illness. The same information will be gathered from two control groups. The study will utilize a questionnaire that will be developed and provided by CDC investigators. The vendor will administer phone interviews with the cases and with controls.

SCOPE OF WORK:     

The vendor shall provide all labor, equipment and supplies necessary to conduct two separate sets of telephone interviews. The sample size for the first set is expected to be approximately 600 persons; the second set will involve re-contacting persons from the first survey. All persons will be identified according to criteria established by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigators.  CDC will provide the list of persons and phone numbers for 400 persons in the study; vendor will randomly digit dail 200 persons.  

The vendor shall be responsible for random digit dialing a selection of 200 controls individually matched by town to 200 persons identified by CDC investigators as requiring controlled matching by municipality. The Government will provide guidance on the method to be used for random digit dialing. The vendor will provide references of the method used for random digit dialing.

The vendor shall agree to include in the training of interviews a four-hour training session with the CDC principal investigators (PIs) to insure understanding of all details of the questions in the questionnaire and guidelines for the protection of confidentiality of all persons interviewed.  Special care shall be taken to protect human subjects’ confidentiality as specified by written instructions from CDC. 

The vendor shall send the first 10 completed questionnaires to the CDC Technical Contact within one week of initiation of the interviews.  No further interviews shall be conducted without written approval by the CDC principal investigator.  If, upon completion of the first 10 questionnaires, CDC investigators decide to make changes to the questionnaire or to change the method of interviewing, the vendor shall be notified within five business days about the changes and the period of performance will be adjusted accordingly. It is expected that this requirement of the study will involve minor modifications to the period of performance under this purchase order.  

The vendor shall be responsible for entering data in a database. The database structure will be decided by CDC investigators with input from the vendor, using Access or similar Software. 

Completed survey forms will be returned by the vendor to CDC in the format produced by the database, in printed, and electronic versions. 

TASKS:  

The vendor shall conduct the following tasks associated with the requirements under this purchase order.   

1.  The vendor shall provide a list of participating staff involved in the tasks outlined in the Statement of Work.                
2.  The vendor shall provide a schedule of all proposed training sessions for staff participating in the telephone surveys.
3. The vendor’s training for interviewers shall include a 4-hour Training Session provided by the CDC Investigators prior to the actual start of the telephone survey.
4.  The vendor shall provide timely reports and prompt responses (within 24 hours) to queries from the CDC Dengue Branch by telephone or e-mail. 
5. The vendor shall submit an electronic weekly report formatted in Excel to the Dengue Branch in both printed and electronic forms.  The report will include a list of persons contacted; those contacted that didn’t agree to participate; persons who participated in the survey; persons pending contact; and dates and number of attempts to contact a person on the list of contacts.  The Vendor shall also report on the status of the project implementation and any other problems or difficulties encountered.
6.  The vendor shall deliver in electronic and hard copy complete interviews and refusals (that is, incomplete interviews) of persons included in the weekly list. 
7. The Vendor shall develop and submit an electronic and hard copy printed monthly summary report formatted in Excel to the Dengue Branch.

Less than half pallet loads or loads shipped by small package carrier in acceptable transport packing need not be palletized. When less than full but more than a half pallet is used, the palletized load shall utilize proper bracing and/or reinforcement to ensure that the load can withstand two additional loads placed on it. 

Stacking:  A load-stacking test shall be performed once, at the beginning of the contract, for each different unitized or palletized load configuration. A fully palletized load shall be tested utilizing a total stack of three palletized loads, with all the proper bracing and/or reinforcement necessary to perform the test. There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations.

Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified. 

Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.
