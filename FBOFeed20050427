<ARCHDATE>04272006
<CONTACT>MARGARET A. FRITTS mfritts@usgs.gov CONTRACT SPECIALIST 7036487381     mfritts@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), St. Petersburg, FL intends to make award, on a sole source basis, to Winning Ticket Corporation, North Miami, FL to lease a fully found and crewed vessel, with support equipment to use as a base for USGS underwater equipment deployment and 24 hour in situ geochemical monitoring on the reef tract in South Florida and the Florida Keys from Biscayne Bay to Long Key and the western Bahamas.  Mobilization and demobilization will be in Miami, FL.  Central to the success of the field work associated with this project is the use of a large submersible incubation chamber.  Deployment of this chamber requires anchoring of a large boat to use as a surface platform for analytical equipment attached to the incubation chamber when it is deployed on the seafloor.  The boat must maintain a very stable position, and this will require deployment of no less than 4 anchors.  Vessel will operate between Miami, the Florida Keys Reef Tract, and Nassau.  The contractor shall provide the fully found, crewed vessel and support equipment to enable the Government to deploy underwater incubation chambers with umbilical attachments to analytical equipment aboard the vessel.  The Period of Performance for this vessel will be 10 days in August and 10 days in November 2005 and will be required to remain on site for 24 hours per day for.  Exact dates will depend upon coordination of work with other agencies and relevant timing for seasonal ecosystem processes.  The contractor shall be responsible for all preparations and maintenance of the vessel and vessel equipment necessary to ensure safe and proper working conditions.  The contractor shall provide as a minimum crew, a captain and mate both experienced in marine diving and other personnel as deemed necessary by the contractor.  The contractor shall obtain and maintain in effect all necessary permits (except research permits), inspections, certifications, and insurance required by Federal Statue or local government, or subdivision thereof, or of any other duly constituted public authority.  Study sites will include environmentally sensitive areas.  Navigation of a large vessel and deployment of anchors in these areas is prohibited except by permit due to potential danger of disturbing fragile coral reef habitat and of navigating in areas containing coral reef.  Captain Barry Denton of Winning Ticket is believed to be the only source familiar enough with the coral reef habitat in Biscayne National Park and Bahamas and is the only known source with expertise in this logistically difficult field operation including (a) both fair and foul weather navigation; (b) navigation in areas containing navigation hazards (coral reefs); (c) precise four-point anchoring of vessels greater than 55 feet in length; (d) excellent assistance with scientific activities during field expeditions; (e) and excellent resource for knowledge and business contact information in every new location in which we have worked; (f) and accumulated and detailed knowledge of our field scientific procedures and the goals of our field expeditions.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.  Quotes are due 5/10/2005. The anticipated award date is 05/12/2005.  The NAICS code is 423860.  A determination not to continue with this acquisition based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled Technical Assistance and Logistical Support for the Treatment Improvement Exchange (TIE).  This project is to maintain the Treatment Improvement Exchange (TIE), comprising expert consultants, a series of technical assistance conferences, on-site consultations, and documents targeted on population-specific needs and on general planning, fiscal, management, and clinical issues in support of CSAT's State Systems Development Program (SSDP) initiative. Specifically, the objectives of this contract are to: 1. Maintain and manage the TIE Forum, an electronic means of communication between CSAT and State and Territories substance abuse agencies, grantees, and contractors, between these entities and CSAT, and among themselves. 2. Maintain the consultant exchange database (web-based system), for use in this contract and as a service of common concern for all CSAT contracts providing data on and needing access to a pool of experts in the topic areas of CSAT's population-specific initiatives and its planning, financing, management, and clinical initiatives. These consultants will provide on-site and off-site technical assistance to State substance abuse offices or providers (or as required by other contracts participating in the Consultant Exchange Data Base (CEDB) and others). Input data into the complimentary component of the CEDB, the technical assistance tracking system (TA Tracker). The TA tracking system contains both coded and detailed narrative information on TA activities and the personnel and budget required to complete the activity. The system can sort and organize the data into a variety of reports, enabling member contractors to report in a standard and uniform format. The TA Tracker is also used as a management tool by federal government project officers. 3. Put on a series of medium and large meetings to facilitate technical assistance in support of the SSDP and in areas of need identified by CSAT or the State and Territories substance abuse offices. 4. Develop reports and documents to support the requirements of the SSDP, and that can be used by the States and Territories to strengthen their ability to plan, manage, enhance and monitor their substance abuse treatment services and service systems. These include, but are not limited to, technical reports, literature reviews, manuals, special reports, analytical reports, guidelines, and conduct annual state satisfaction assessment.  The estimated date for issuance of this RFP is May 12, 2005 with proposal responses due June 10, 2005.

<DESC>The U.S Department of Education (ED), Institute for Education Sciences (IES) National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) requires technical assistance and expert advice to support its assessment development, methodological research, and statistical product preparation related to the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP). NAEP is complex and long term, with each assessment data collection extending over many years and recurring on a periodic basis. Further, assessments in various subject areas run concurrently and with differing development cycles. 

Although the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), the policy oversight board for NAEP has established a basic schedule of NAEP assessments, NCES must be able to adapt rapidly to changing priorities and policies. NCES also must incorporate the latest scientific advances in how data are designed, collected, analyzed and reported.  The functions of NESSI must mirror and extend the work of NCES' Assessment Division, which is responsible for the conduct of NAEP, as well as key NCES center-wide functions particularly relevant to NAEP. Such an approach is necessary so that NAEP can continue to evolve and meet these challenges while still remaining statistically stable and living up to its reputation as the "gold standard" in large-scale assessments.

Accordingly, NESSI must provide assistance to the NCES through a long-term commitment, in collaboration with the agency and the NAEP program staff, other NAEP contractors, and to some extent, other programs within NCES.

During the period of performance NCES anticipates the need for NESSI to carry out a wide variety of activities. The expected work falls into the four broad project categories described below.  The individual tasks may require a combination of all four types of work.

1.  Statistical and psychometric methodology research

Advanced psychometrics and state-of-the-art statistical methodology work will support the continuous improvement of both the conduct of NAEP data collections and the analysis of data from those collections.  Priority is placed on methodological work and related theoretical underpinnings that are relevant to both the state of the field and to the particular needs of educational large-scale assessments.

2.  Statistical analyses

Such work will include both the most commonly used statistical procedures and advanced psychometric techniques to guide and ensure that analytic studies are designed in such a way as to produce valid and reliable NAEP data. The NESSI statistical analyses activities will employ the most commonly accepted statistical procedures in accordance with NCES' psychometric techniques and statistical standards (http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/2002/stdtoc.asp) and consistent with NAEP's reporting goals and objectives. The focus will be primarily on analysis and report writing, ad hoc data analysis requests; and ongoing monitoring of NAEP data analysis integrity. Priority is placed on the evaluation of the full range of audiences served by the NAEP data products.

3.  Development

The primary objectives are to: (1) assist NAEP staff in the monitoring and critical review of NAEP item development, survey instrument design, and scoring activities; (2) coordinate the on-going reviews, revisions and/or approval of NAEP items and survey instruments by NAGB, subject area specialists, state representatives and other educational bodies; (3) identify relevant information sources, technologies, literature and emerging trends in educational assessment that bear upon the quality and integrity of future NAEP instrument designs and data interpretations; (4) design or adapt improved methods for assessing students through innovative and effective item types; and (5) identify new and effective ways of administering large-scale assessment surveys given emerging challenges in areas such as nonresponse, motivation, and participation.

4.  Project management

Such work will include technical support for NAEP operations through assistance in the planning and implementation of data collections, monitoring and tracking activities of reports and publications and technical review of all NAEP products, including the Web-based ones.  Work will be characterized by its comprehensive response to information needs, both current and anticipated; continuity, where appropriate, to permit analyses across projects; cost effectiveness; and timeliness.

The Department of Education estimates a period of performance of a 12-month base year and four 12-month options.

The opening date is on or around May 13, 2005; the closing date is July 7, 2005 at 2:00 p.m. EDT. Copies of the solicitation will be available for download on http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. 
Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR 
record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent  information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather 
information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into 
the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your 
ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.

HITS currently provides inter and intra base switched services, dedicated transmission services, network management, and administrative operation and maintenance of a leased switch network.  The scope of the JHITS will be essentially the same as the current HITS contract; however, the structure of the resultant contract and the methodology by which the successful offeror will provision services under JHITS will be significantly different than the current HITS structure.  A one-day industry conference has been scheduled for 19 August 2003, in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The conference will outline the major structural and methodology changes embodied in the JHITS acquisition, the impact of other DISA and Armed Forces Information Technology contracts on JHITS services, and the proposed JHITS acquisition schedule.  The specific conference location has not been finalized.  There will be a subsequent posting providing detailed information within the next several weeks.  Interested parties are invited to reply to this announcement.  This does not constitute a registration; however, it will assist the government in determining the approximate size of the required facility.

<DESC>N00244 Naval Base 937 North Harbor Drive San Diego, CA Laura Maxwell 619-532-2365 This is published as a sole source announcement under the authority of the test program for commercial items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  The proposed contract action is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to the authority FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii).   See Note 22.  The NAICS code for this action is 621511. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source contract to Fetal Diagnostics Laboratories to provide laboratory testing services for the Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).  Services required include accurate testing and interpretation of STAT (time) samples, with results provided within 24 hours after receipt of specimen, reporting to NMCSD with critical value within one hour of verifying results of testing, providing hard copies of laboratory test results within 10 working days of testing, and providing daily courier services to transport specimens from NMCSD laboratory to testing facility.   Fetal Diagnostics Laboratories is the only known reference laboratory in the San Diego area that can perform the specialized tests for fetal lung maturity and L/S ratio, and can provide results within 24 hours after receipt of the specimen.  The NMCD has numerous patients currently monitored through Fetal Diagnostics Laboratories, and any interruption in services may jeopardize the health of these patients and/ or their unborn children.  It is critical to the long term monitoring of a patient’s condition that the same laboratory perform all the required testing and thereby maintain the integrity of the samples. Test results and patient diagnosis may be compromised if laboratory specimens are sent to a laboratory other than Fetal Diagnostics during the course of treatment of the patient.   The proposed contract is for a base period of three months, from 1 July 2005 through 30 September 2005, with 4 one-year option periods to follow.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, and provide evidence of HIPAA compliance, CLIA certification and CAP accreditation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all statements of interest and capability received no later than 10 May 2005.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All statements of interest/capability documentation must be submitted via email attachment or fax to the attention of Ms. Laura Maxwell at 619-532-4957.  Mailed documents wi! ll not be accepted.  All questions pertaining to this synopsis shall be submitted by e-mail only.   Solicitation N00244-05-T-0540 issued to Fetal Diagnostics will be posted to www.neco.navy.mil on or about 11 May 2005.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF AT LEAST (4) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(A), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. THE OTHER THREE (3) ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  

The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-05-R-0095.  The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for military installations serviced by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and also NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Task Orders may be issued as either Design-Build or 100% Plans and Specifications.  

The work will be at the following primary locations:  NAS Meridian, NCBC Gulfport, NS Pascagoula, Stennis Space Center, Keesler AFB, NAS/NSA New Orleans, Barksdale AFB, and NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The total estimated value for all contracts will not exceed $350,000,000.  The anticipated construction cost of each task order is between $3,000,000 to $15,000,000 with the average project in the $3,000,000 - $10,000,000 range.  Some projects may include significantly developed designs.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. The minimum guarantee is $25,000 for each contract.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  

The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. 

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (one) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8(a), HUBZONE, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.

In Phase II, a maximum of seven (7) Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000.  THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT AS THE FIRST TASK ORDER UNDER THE CONTRACT.
  

All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  

The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 7 March 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official plan holders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for writing the Second Edition of "Flight of Discovery". NASA/DFRC intends to have the author of the 1st Edition, Lane Wallace, write the Second Edition. The contractor will write an updated narrative about the story of Dryden after conducting oral interviews with a number of DFRC employees familiar with its technical achievements and its new directions, and also by consulting appropriate written materials, most available at DFRC. Ms. Wallace's most notable work is "Flight of Discovery: 50 Years of NASA Dryden Flight Research Center". Published in 1996, now a second edition of "Flight of Discovery" is in process, and Ms. Wallace represents the only author with the knowledge of NASA and Dryden, because she wrote the first edition. Ms. Wallace is also the only person with the qualifications to update the second edition swiftly, confidently, and in a way entirely consistent with the original. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on _____May 12, 2005____________. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Phone: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for on a wastewater collection, disposal, and treatment project for the city of Taiz, Yemen.

Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Arab world, faces a high population growth rate and scarce water resources.  The demand for fresh water in the country is expected to exceed water resources capacity within the next few decades and a substantive water supply deficit is expected to occur within the next two decades.  These problems are exacerbated in Taiz, the country’s third largest city and one of the fastest growing, which receives an average of only 21 inches of rainfall per year.  According to data from the Yemeni Ministry of Planning and Development, the city’s population will increase from 446,874 in 2000 to 1,033,172 in 2020.  Current water supply sources for the City of Taiz are water wells, which produce an average of 17,000 m3/day (4.49 million gallons/day).  Available water supply sources cannot meet existing water demand.  Water supply shortages lead to the utilization of wastewater for irrigation.  In addition, groundwater from the water wells exhibits high nitrate content and does not meet the World Health Organization drinking water standard. Nitrate contamination of groundwater generally occurs as a result of the infiltration of wastewater and fertilizers. 

The existing wastewater facility in Taiz was installed in the 1970’s and consists of rudimentary primary treatment and a set of two anaerobic lagoons followed by a facultative and a maturation pond.  The lagoons provide secondary treatment but the effluent does not meet secondary treatment standards.  The pretreatment of the water, involving the disposal of screenings, grit, and sludge is currently uncontrolled, creating insect proliferation.  Leakage of wastewater drainage into the surrounding topsoil occurs on a regular basis.  The lagoon pools are not fenced and local farmers illegally pump wastewater from the treatment pools to use for irrigation purposes.  The effluent does not meet water quality standards for irrigation, therefore its use bears a public health risk.  In addition, the effluent contains a high concentration of dissolved solids and there is a high potential for increasing soluble salts content in the irrigated soil, which leads to soil salinity and economic losses due to low agriculture productivity. 

The wastewater treatment plant in Taiz underwent a minor expansion in the mid-1980s.  The system covers approximately thirteen percent of the city’s area with forty percent of the city’s population connected.  The existing wastewater collection system is operated as a gravity system with no pumping stations.  Four trunk mainlines meet at a central location, where wastewater flows to the lagoons of the wastewater treatment plant.  Long flow time in the system generates high levels of sulfate gas, resulting in corrosion of the pipe material.  Many of the large industrial outfits in Taiz operate their own wastewater management system and industrial wastewater is often discharged in open ditches and/or to groundwater.  

The Government of Yemen commissioned an independent study to assess the deteriorating wastewater treatment situation in Taiz.  In December 2001, the consulting firm Dorsch Consult prepared a report for the Yemeni Ministry of Electricity and Water, entitled “Taiz Water Supply and Sanitation Project.”  This study, also known as the Initial Development Plan, provides a description of the existing water and wastewater facilities in the city and analyzes two scenarios for the expansion of the wastewater management system. The main difference between the two scenarios investigated is that Scenario 1 would provide sewerage for 100% of Taiz and Scenario 2 would increase coverage to only 75%. In both cases the planned coverage would be achieved by the year 2010.  The Initial Development Plan laid the conceptual foundation for the Taiz Wastewater System project and the Feasibility Study will assess which scenario is most appropriate for the City of Taiz.

The proposed project would rehabilitate and install a new wastewater collection, disposal and treatment system for the city of Taiz.  The Feasibility Study would include the preliminary detailed engineering design and preparation of tender documents for the project.  The study will achieve an overall analysis of present water supply and sanitation conditions while also taking into account future requirement expectations.  The study will ensure that the facilities to be provided are efficient cost solutions, technically feasible, and financially and environmentally sustainable.  In addition, the most feasible alternatives for effluent reuse, sludge treatment and use and odor control for wastewater will be determined by the Feasibility Study.  The study consultant will conduct:  1) Definition of Current Conditions, Inception Report, and Workplan; 2) Technical Analysis; 3) Feasibility Analysis of the Project; 4) Project Implementation Plan; and 5) Final Report. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $492,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

<DESC>General Services Administration(GSA)Lease No. GS-09B-01410 provides 41,224 rentable ssquare feet of office and related space in a modern, high quality office building in Santa Ana, CA with a parking ratio of 4/1,000rsf. There is an additional requirement for approximately 21,000rsf with similar parking ratio.  It is intended that the additional 21,000rsf will be negotiated into the superseding lease.

GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation would be economically advantageous to the Government.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including but not limited to the total cost of the physical move,(including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and the anticipated rent for the space, as well as other factors impacting the Governments' rights under a prospective lease, such as , for example the length of any firm term that might be required at an alternative location, the length of time necessary to deliver the space ready for occupancy, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term.

Persons interested in providing space to the Government whom believe they can do so at more favorable terms than those of a Superseding Lease should contact Ms. Dianne McNerney at 
(949)360-2021.

Contract N00019-97-C-2034 was awarded on the basis of a competitively solicited, commercial contract.  Contracts N00019-00-C-0299 and N00019-01-C-0071 were followed on aircraft procurements.  In order to maintain logistics support integrity and reduce support costs, it is necessary to maintain commonality by procuring the same type model series aircraft as was done under the previous contracts.  These aircraft will be the 10th through the 13th aircraft in the Navy C-40 fleet, which is the replacement aircraft for the Navy DC-9 aircraft.  This aircraft will provide the capability for cargo and passenger transportation and is capable of providing forward deployment logistics support.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>UPDATE 27 April 2005:  A new document, the  B-52 SOJS Operational Synopsis White Paper, has been posted in the Bidders Library at the end of this  announcement for information purposes. UPDATE 25 April 2005:  An updated draft Attachment 2 (Section L) and an  updated draft Attachment 3 (Section M) have been posted in the Bidders Library  at the end of this announcement.  Changes have been made in red ink for ease  in identification. UPDATE 07 April 2005:  An updated draft RFP has been posted in the Bidders  Library at the end of this announcment.  The purpose is to pass on the  incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. The following attachments to the RFP have been updated as well:  CDRL Exhibit  A, CDRL Exhibit B, Attachment 1 (SOO), Attachment 2 (Section L), Attachment 3  (Section M), and Attachment 4 (TCP) and the DD 254. UPDATE 25 March 2005:  The Airborne Electronic Attack Squadron (AEASS) cannot  release the B-52 SOJ RFP until final approval of the acquisition strategy  and  the source selection plan.  We anticipate that may take another two weeks.  In  the interim, we plan to post an updated draft in the next few days to pass on  the incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. As you are aware, we have been on a very aggressive schedule.  The delays we  are experiencing put our contract award schedule at risk.  We are requesting  your cooperation in helping us make up some schedule time by reducing the  number of days required for proposal preparation.  If you plan to bid this  program, request you provide the PCO feedback on the acceptability of reducing  the number of days for proposal submission from 45 days to a lesser number,  and identify the minimum time you believe is required.  Request your response  by 1 April 2005.  When a go-ahead is received from SAF/AQ and OSD, the AEASS  will determine the proposal due date and adjust the expected contract award  date accordingly.  UPDATE 22 March 2005:  A new attachment with the title of Questions and  Answers has been added to the document library below. UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.  Offerors are requested  to notify the PCO when the Past Performance volume is anticipated to be  submitted. UPDATE 9 March 2005 (Second update for this date):  RFP release is delayed  pending completion of the Government+s review/approval process.  Tentative  date for release is now 25 March 2005, in which case proposals will be due by  10 May 2005. However, the Past Performance Volume will be due by 15 Apr 2005.   The Government still plans to award the contract by the end of July 2005. Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors is modified by  making the following change to Table 3.1 Proposal Organization in Paragraph  3.1.5.2, Organization, Number of Copies, and Page Limits.  The maximum page  limit for Vol III, Past Performance, is now 60 pages.  Within those 60 pages,  there should be no more than 5 pages per each past contract. UPDATE 9 March 2005:  The briefings and documents promised at the B-52 Stand- off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference on 16 Feb 2005 are now available for  distribution.  There are two CDs available for distribution.  The first CD  (unclassified) was mailed on 7 Mar 05 to each company /office that attended  the conference.  The second CD (classified) is available for local  representatives of any company which attended the conference to pick up.

UPDATE 8 March 05:  Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to  Offerors is hereby amended to change the font requirement for graphics only.

This announcement is being posted to provide information about the  program to prospective bidders.  Questions may be submitted to the points of  contact listed at the bottom of this announcement.  We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

The purpose of this notice is to notify interested industry personnel of the potential cancellation of the Montana Pre-Solicitation Conference.

The Draft Solicitation and the special project web page states that contractors intending on attending the conference(s) must register.  Registration can either be made viewable by the public or viewable only by FHWA personnel.

Due to the cost of holding 2 conferences, a cancellation determination for the Missoula MT conference will be made on May 5, 2005.

As of the date of this posting, there are not enough registered participants to hold the Missoula conference.

Should the Montana conference be cancelled, the Vancouver conference remains as scheduled.

<DESC>DISA-PAC has commenced an acquisition program for the Joint Hawaii Information Transfer Service (JHITS).  JHITS is the replacement program for the Hawaii Information Transfer System (HITS).  HITS currently provides inter and intra base switched services, dedicated transmission services, network management, and administrative operation and maintenance of a leased switch network.  The scope of the JHITS will be essentially the same as the current HITS contract; however, the structure of the resultant contract and the methodology by which the successful offeror will provision services under JHITS will be significantly different than the current HITS structure.  A one-day industry conference has been scheduled for 19 August 2003, 0900 - 1600.  The conference will be held at the Ilikai Hotel, Waikiki.  Parking is $3.00 per day with conference validation.  It will outline the major structural and methodology changes embodied in the JHITS acquisition, the impact of other DISA and Armed Forces Information Technology contracts on JHITS services, and the proposed JHITS acquisition schedule.    Request that all offerors planning to attend provide the names, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of the proposed attendees.  Identification badges, attendance rosters, and e-mail addresses will be available at the sign-in table.  Please submit your reply to the primary Point of Contact listed in this announcement.

L.4	FAR 52.252-01 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Jun 1988)

This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the contracting officer will make their full text available.

NOTICE: The following FAR provisions or clauses pertinent to this section are hereby incorporated by reference. (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1)

52.215-1  Instructions to Offerors - Competitive  Oct 1997

L.5	FAR 52.204-6 Contractor Identification Number--Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number (Dec 1996)

(a)	Contractor Identification Number, as used in this provision, means AData Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number,@ which is a nine-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services.

(b)	Contractor identification is essential for complying with statutory contract reporting requirements.  Therefore, the offeror is requested to enter, in the block with its name and address on the Standard Form 33 or similar document, the annotation ADUNS@ followed by the DUNS number which identifies the offeror=s name and address exactly as stated in the offer.

(c)	If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.  A DUNS number will be provided immediately by telephone at no charge to the offeror.  For information on obtaining a DUNS number, the offeror should call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505.  The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information.

1)	Company name

2)	Company address

3)	Company telephone number

 
4)	Line of business

5)	Chief executive officer/key manager

6)	Date the company was started

7)	Number of people employed by the company

8)	Company affiliation

(d)	Offerors located outside the United States may obtain the location and phone number of the local Dun and Bradstreet Information Services office from the Internet Home Page at http://www.dbisna.com/dbis/customer/custlist.htm.  If an offeror is unable to locate a local service center, it may send an e-mail to Dun and Bradstreet at globalinfo@dbisma.com.

L.6	Contract Award 

(a)	The government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and sub-factors in the solicitation.

(b)	The government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the government=s interest.

(c)	The government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals 		received.

(d)	The government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offeror=s initial proposal should contain the offeror=s best terms from a cost or price and technical stand point.  The government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the contracting officer later determines them to be necessary.  If the contracting officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted,  the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

(e)	The government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. 

(f)	The government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the government=s best interest to do so.
 
(g)	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counter-offer by the government.

(h)	The government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items.  Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques.  A proposal may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable rist to the government.

(i)	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  

(j)	The government may disclose the following information in post-award debriefings to other offers: (1) the overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful offeror; (2) the overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection; (3) a summary of the rationale for award; and (4) for acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

L.7	FAR 52.216-1 Type of Contract (Apr 1984)

The Government contemplates award of a time-and-materials contract as a result of this solicitation.

L.8	FAR 52.233-02 Service of Protest (Aug 1996)

(a)	Protests as defined in section 33.1.1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO), shall be served on the contracting officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:

<SUBJECT>Y -- IDIQ MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT(S) - DESIGN-BUILD/100%PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS
<SOLNBR>N62467-05-R-0095
<RESPDATE>040605
<CONTACT>Adam Solivan, Contract Specialist, Phone 843-820-5677, Fax null, Email adam.solivan@navy.mil
<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF AT LEAST (4) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(A), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. THE OTHER CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-05-R-0095.  The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for military installations serviced by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and also the ROICC Fort Worth, TX area of responsibility.  Task Orders may be issued as either Design-Build or 100% Plans and Specifications.  The work will be at the following primary locations:  NAS Meridian, NCBC Gulfport, NS Pascagoula, Stennis Space Center, Keesler AFB, NAS/NSA New Orleans, Barksdale AFB, and NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The total estimated value for all contracts will not exceed $350,000,000.  The anticipated construction cost of each task order is between $3,000,000 to $15,000,000 with the average project in the $3,000,000 - $10,000,000 range.  Some projects may include significantly developed designs.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS, ONE OR MORE WITH SEED PROJECT(S) IDENTIFIED IN THIS SOLICITATION AND THE REMAINING WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000 FOR THE ENTIRE CONTRACT.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (one) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8(a), HUBZONE, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven (7) Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS, ONE OR MORE WITH THE SEED PROJECT(S) IDENTIFIED IN THIS SOLICITATION AND THE REMAINING WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000 FOR THE ENTIRE CONTRACT.  THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE WILL BE AWARDED ONE OR MORE SEED PROJECTS AS TASK ORDER(S) UNDER THE CONTRACT.  All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 7 March 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official plan holders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Offeror’s must also be registered in the Contractor’s Central Registration (CCR) in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.  For inquiries about proposals due or number of amendments issued, contact Adam Solivan at 843-820-5677.  Technical inquiries must be submitted in writing 15 days before proposals are due to the address listed above, or sent by email to Adam.Solivan@navy.mil.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF AT LEAST (4) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(A), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. THE OTHER CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-05-R-0095.  The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for military installations serviced by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and also the ROICC Fort Worth, TX area of responsibility; however the Government reserves the right to award contracts under the Naval Facilities Engineering Command’s area of responsibility.  Task Orders may be issued as either Design-Build or 100% Plans and Specifications. The work will be at the following primary locations:  NAS Meridian, NCBC Gulfport, NS Pascagoula, Stennis Space Center, Keesler AFB, NAS/NSA New Orleans, Barksdale AFB, and NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas, and military installations in the ROICC Fort Worth, TX area of responsibility; however the Government reserves the right to award contracts under the Naval Facilities Engineering Command’s area of responsibility.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The total estimated value for all contracts will not exceed $350,000,000.  The anticipated construction cost of each task order is between $3,000,000 to $15,000,000 with the average project in the $3,000,000 - $10,000,000 range.  Some projects may include significantly developed designs.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000; THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE FOUR WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TASK ORDER.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams), unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than seven (7) is in the Government’s interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design build contracting. The narrowing phase is based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (one) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8(a), HUBZONE, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract. In Phase II, a maximum of seven (7) Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals, unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than seven (7) is in the Government’s interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design build contracting. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000; THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE FOUR WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TASK ORDER. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 7 March 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official plan holders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.  Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Offeror’s must also be registered in the Contractor’s Central Registration (CCR) in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>A proposal conference will be held with prospective offerors at SA-20 on March 29, 2005 at 9:00 a.m.  SA-20 is located at 1801 N. Lynn Street, Rosslyn, Virginia  22091.  The pre-proposal conference will be held for the purpose of providing information concerning the Government’s requirements which may be helpful in the preparation of proposals and for answering any questions regarding this solicitation.

Attendance at the pre-proposal conference is recommended; however, attendance is not a prerequisite for proposal submission and will not be considered a factor in proposal evaluation.

The success of the conference depends on the leadtime available to the government for research in connection with questions submitted by prospective offerors.  Therefore, you are requested to e-mail all written questions concerning any areas of uncertainty which, in your opinion, require clarification or correction, by 2:30 p.m. March 25, 2005.  A set of questions and answers will be furnished to all prospective offerors whether or not they are in attendance at the conference and will be posted in FEDBIZOPPS and the Statebuy website.

Due to space limitations, each prospective offeror will be limited to a total of two representatives.  Prospective offerors shall notify Deborah Carey by e-mail to CareyDA@state.gov  by 5:00 p.m. March 25, 2005 if they plan to attend the pre-proposal conference.  The e-mail shall specify the names of attendees, work phone number, e-mail address, work and home address of those attending the conference.  (The home address is required for security screening purposes by Diplomatic Security guards.)

The pre-proposal conference will include a tour of the call center and the unclassified server room of SA-20.  All attendees must be U.S. citizens in order to tour the unclassified server room.

For security screening purposes all representatives attending the conference must be U.S. citizens.  All attendees will be required to bring a state or federal issued picture identification.  No cameras and/or recording devices will be allowed at the pre-proposal conference.  Please allow plenty of time prior to the start of the conference for gaining access to SA-20 due to access procedures into the building.

Due to projected interest in the pre-proposal conference, multiple sessions may be held, starting at 9:00 a.m. and at regular intervals during the day.  Vendors will be notified via e-mail as to which group they are assigned once it is determined how many will be in attendance.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This project is intended to be solicited as a Small Business Set Aside.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Large Business, HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to the NAICS Codes. 
Project Title: Technical Assistance and Logistical Support for the Treatment Improvement Exchange 
Project Description:  To maintain the Treatment Improvement Exchange (TIE), comprising expert consultants, a series of technical assistance conferences, on-site consultations, and documents targeted on population-specific needs and on general planning, fiscal, management, and clinical issues in support of CSAT's State Systems Development Program (SSDP) initiative.  Specifically, the objectives of this contract are to:

1.  Maintain and manage the TIE Forum, an electronic means of communication between CSAT and State and Territories substance abuse agencies, grantees, and contractors, between these entities and CSAT, and among themselves.

2.  Maintain the consultant exchange database (web-based system), for use in this contract and as a service of common concern for all CSAT contracts providing data on and needing access to a pool of experts in the topic areas of CSAT's population-specific initiatives and its planning, financing, management, and clinical initiatives. These consultants will provide on-site and off-site technical assistance to State substance abuse offices or providers (or as required by other contracts participating in the Consultant Exchange Data Base (CEDB) and others).
		
Input data into the complimentary component of the CEDB, the technical assistance tracking system (TA Tracker).  The TA tracking system contains both coded and detailed narrative information on TA activities and the personnel and budget required to complete the activity.  The system can sort and organize the data into a variety of reports, enabling member contractors to report in a standard and uniform format.  The TA Tracker is also used as a management tool by federal government project officers.

3.  Put on a series of medium and large meetings to facilitate technical assistance in support of the SSDP and in areas of need identified by CSAT or the State and Territories substance abuse offices.

4.  Develop reports and documents to support the requirements of the SSDP, and that can be used by the States and Territories to strengthen their ability to plan, manage, enhance and monitor their substance abuse treatment services and service systems.  These include, but are not limited to, technical reports, literature reviews, manuals, special reports, analytical reports, guidelines, and conduct annual state satisfaction assessment
Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in determining if the appropriate acquisition method.  Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger).  In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted. Responses are due March 30, 2005. The anticipated period of performance is a base year with 4 [12 month] option years. After review of the responses received a solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities around April 5, 2005.

<DESC>88-CBP REQUEST FOR INFORMATION CANINE ACQUISITION

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
 
The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking industry interest and information on a requirement for law enforcement working canines/dogs. Both the U.S. Customs Service and the Border patrol have long-standing programs to acquire untrained dogs for the important mission of safeguarding our borders and ports-of-entry. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Customs & Border Protection has elevated the need to secure a steady supply of the highest quality canines for this vital mission. These canines must possess genetic traits that predispose them for work in a law enforcement environment. The Government seeks alternative approaches to establish and maintain this source or sources of supply. In keeping with this goal, the Government seeks industry input to:

·	discover additional sources for our expanding program
·	discover and implement best practices for procuring untrained dogs
 
The following requirements are applicable to the type and quality of dogs sought:

a.	Age — The canine shall have a documented age between twelve (12) and thirty-eight (38) months.
b.	Weight — The canine shall weigh no less than forty-five (45) pounds nor more than ninety (90) pounds.
c.	Size — The canine shall measure not less than twenty-two (22) inches no more than thirty (30) inches at the shoulder.
d.	Sex — The canine may be either male or female.
e.	Breeds — 
(1)	Office of Border Patrol (OBP). Either Belgian Malinois or Dutch Shepherds are acceptable. German Shepherds and Belgian herding breeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Government.
(2)	Office of Field Operations (OFO) A recognized working or sporting breed such as the following: Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd or Belgian Malinois.
f.	Lineage — 
(1)	OBP Special Requirement: The canine shall be European born or of European lineage traceable by two generations.
(2)	OFO has no special requirement for the lineage of their canines.

Government agencies will administer a series of tests on the canine to determine whether it has the capability of working in the particular environment peculiar to that agency. The most important factor in selecting detector dogs for training is not its breed, but the extent of enthusiasm the dog displays toward retrieving a given object. For more general information concerning CBP Canine Programs, visit the following web sites: 
·	http://cbpnet.cbp.dhs.gov/linkhandler/cbpnet/obp/bp_handbook/30.ctt/Chapter%2030%20Canine.pdf 
·	http://cbpnet.cbp.dhs.gov/linkhandler/cbpnet/toolbox/forms/cbp_forms/312.ctt/CBP-312.pdf
These tests, administered to all potential CBP dogs, will reveal if they possess the inherited traits that make them a likely candidate for detection training. The canine must pass these tests in order to be accepted in the canine training program. These tests consist of the following:

1. OBP Test Battery
a.	Stable Character Test  
b.	Retrieval Prey Drive Test 
c.	Perseverance Test 
d.	Water Conflict Test
e.	Food Conflict Test 
f.	Handler/Object Conflict Test 
g.	Hunt Drive Test 
h.	On-line Search Test 

2. OFO Test Battery
a.	Work area adaptability (confined spaces, elevated objects, on moving objects, etc.)
b.	Strong desire to retrieve and possess an object thrown into a variety of environments under varying circumstances.

Throughout the selection phase, the canine must show that it possesses the temperament and genetic drives to work within a law enforcement environment based on the following attributes and criteria:

a.	Socialization 
b.	Courage/Confidence:
c.	Drives 

Documentation such as vaccination records, health certificate, X-ray’s, and other related paperwork (pedigrees, registration certificates, scorebooks, breed surveys, etc.) shall accompany the canine at the time of delivery: A certified veterinarian will perform a full physical (including x-rays) after the canine successfully completes the selection process.

There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.
This Request For Information is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Government will issue a procurement action. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of contractor’s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. The Government will safeguard proprietary information in accordance with applicable Government regulations.

<SUBJECT>Navy certified dry-docking facilities and dry docking related services, maintenance and modernization
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command wants to conduct a market survey of the private ship repair industry in accordance FAR 15.201 to determine industry's views on and interest in providing Navy certified dry-docking facilities and dry docking related services, maintenance and modernization on U. S. Navy Frigates (FFG), Cruisers (CG) and Destroyers (DDG) class ships home-ported in the Mayport, FL area.  The drydocking services and dry docking related maintenance and  modernization on Navy ships would include docking, undocking, provision of temporary services as well as maintenance and modernization of ships' underwater hull, running gear, sea valves, access cuts,  etc.  The period of performance for this contract will start 01 October 2007 and run through 30 September 2012 (FY 2008 through FY 2012).  Projected dockings will include all scheduled dockings for Mayport home-ported ships (9 dockings currently scheduled) and possible emergent dockings during the period of perform! ance.  To minimize the time that each ship is taken out of service for repair, upgrades or overhaul, the Navy's requirement is to have required topside repairs, alterations and improvement/upgrade work accomplished while the ship is dry docked and the drydocking work is being performed.  The Navy anticipates contracting for the topside work totally separately from this "dry-docking contract"; however, this "dry-docking contract" would include the Navy's Access to Vessels clause and require that the winner of the "dry-docking contract" permit the Navy's third party topside contractors to come onto their facility and onto the dry-docked ship for the purpose of performing the specific Navy contract topside work to the dry-docked ship on a non-interference basis.   It is the Navy's intent to ensure a level playing field for all competitors for topside work, including adding cost factors, as appropriate (for evaluation purposes), to achieve the level playing field.    To fully explore and evaluate what will be required to accomplish this requirement and to identify any and all issues that must be addressed and_or resolved to accomplish the above requirement(s), prospective offerors on this dry-docking procurement and prospective offerors to impacted topside solicitations are invited to express their views, concerns, and  interests in writing and to submit their comments and other input to this prospective requirement to the following address.   Your responses_input is requested by close of business on the 25th of May 2005.    	Naval Sea Systems Command  	Attn: Mr. J. B.

<SUBJECT>A--POLICY STATEMENT CONCERNING THE ESMD SYSTEMS ENGINEERING & INTEGRATION SERVICES PROCUREMENT
<DESC>The Vision for Space Exploration affords a unique opportunity to improve systems management and systems engineering processes and reinvigorate the Nation's systems engineering competency. Many institutions, including NASA's Centers are equipped to play a significant role in systems engineering and integration in the Exploration program.  After examining many options, we have formed a policy on institutional support of systems engineering and integration in the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate portfolio, which underscores the importance of reinforcing the Government's internal systems engineering competency. Accordingly, NASA has concluded that Government personnel at Headquarters and NASA Centers will implement systems engineering and integration in Constellation Systems and other areas of the Exploration program. Consequently, Exploration Systems Mission Directorate will not be releasing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an Industry systems engineering and integration contractor. As needs grow in the future, the possibility of an RFP for a systems engineering and integration contractor will be examined. In the near-term however, the majority of the systems engineering and integration workforce will be Government personnel. The time, effort, and resources devoted by Industry and NASA Centers to the formulation of our systems engineering and integration strategy have been of great value and are greatly appreciated.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis, identified as No. A1269905, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to award a purchase order to Ciperson Consulting under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Ciperson Consulting, 3416 Colonial Court, Olney, MD 20832, as in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons:  Ciperson Consulting has worked with FDA over the last several years and has unique knowledge of the Center programs and programs within OSB.  This knowledge was gained from the intimate involvement in these programs from the inception to the current status.  Organizational consulting requires intimate knowledge of the structure and functions of the organization, which Ciperson Consulting possesses.  However, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  The associated NAICS code is 541612 – Human Resources and Executive Search Consulting Services and the small business size standard is $6M.  

The following is background information and the services Ciperson Consulting will be requested to provide:  Current events have placed FDA squarely in the spotlight of public scrutiny with the expectation that the agency will do everything within its power to ensure that the public is not threatened by problems with marketed drugs or medical devices. The Office of Surveillance and Biometrics (OSB)-, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), is the organization primarily responsible for identifying, assessing, researching, and resolving potential public health problems related to medical and/or radiation emitting devices. In order to fulfill its public health expectations, OSB has reached out to other CDRH Offices to establish partnerships and improved practices that will enhance the approval and post market study processes. A series of work groups and resulting recommendations have established a collaborative climate within CDRH and have allowed OSB to take key leadership roles in this organizational improvement effort. With leadership, however, come greater demands on staff and managers to lead effectively, communicate clearly, and prioritize skillfully.

Statement of Work:  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel and services, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the performance of the work described below:
1. Provide expert consultation, facilitation, and active participation in the gathering of data and 
development of findings and recommendations to advance the process improvement efforts undertaken by 
OSB and CDRH.
2. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in identifying additional improvement opportunities that will 
enhance OSB's core businesses.
3. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in implementing new and improved processes and practices.
4. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in developing and 	enhancing the leadership skills and practices required to allow OSB to meet its expanding responsibilities.
5. Provide expert consultation and facilitation to assist OSB leadership in the (re)organization of resources and systems to ensure an efficient and effective structure to address expanding responsibilities.
6. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in the "roll out" of new procedures.
7. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in the monitoring and evaluating of new procedures.
8. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in the identification of new partnership opportunities to allow 
OSB to continue to expand its collaboration efforts.

Period of performance:  Date of award to December 30, 2005. 

The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.  The following agenda have been attached to this provision:  None.  
Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items.

All responsible sources that intend to submit descriptive literature shall submit it by COB on the due date referenced above to the following address or e-mail:  Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2129, HFA-500, Rockville, Maryland  20857-0001 or Lforgosh@oc.fda.gov.

No particular format.  All quotes must be submitted via U.S. Postal Service, Hand Delivery or Delivery Service

The Solicitation mentions MBTI, but I use a different instrument, DiSC Indra by Inscape Publishing.  (In my unbiased opinion it is superior to MBTI.)  Is that acceptable, or do you absolutely have to have MBTI?

It is incumbent upon the contractor to design a training program that meets NIDAs scope of work.

No.  A survey on customer satisfaction was done a number of years ago.

<DESC>The revised response date is February 25, 2005.to offer a competitively priced proposal.  If I am over estimate the time required, my price may not be competitive with another proposal that underestimates the time required.  Will you instead accept an 'estimated' number of training days and judge the proposal on a 'per-day' fee basis?
30.	‘per-day’ fee is acceptable, bearing in mind that a two-day model is preferred.  The training shall not exceed two days.  This is the maximum time allowed for this training for senior management.  

31.	My training firm owns a proprietary 360 degree feedback instrument.  We offer a 'standard' 70 question 360 feedback instrument which has proved quite useful for the majority of our clients.  However, we can also tailor the instrument to specifically model the NIDA Leadership Competency Model, including an entirely new set of instrument questions.  Tailoring the 360 to NIDA specific language makes the instrument more expensive.  Can I offer two prices for the 360 feedback reports for 27 NIDA managers, one price for the 'standard' instrument and one price for the NIDA specific instrument? 
32.	Pricing can be developed both ways.  However, we want a NIDA specific tool to be used for evaluative purposes.  We also want MBTI, FIRO-B, and the 360 degree feedback psychological assessment tools to be used.

33.	Has the NIH-NIDA offered a similar customized curriculum for NIDA senior management/executives on Leadership Development within the last 3 years? No
34.	If yes, what vendor(s) provided the services?

35.	What is the timeline for the deliverables in this solicitation? On or before April 1 , 2005
36.	Can you expand on the qualifications and experience that you will require of the selected vendor/consultants for this contract?
37.	The contractor must demonstrate extensive competency and skill in providing leadership development training.  This can be accomplished by documenting both public and private sector experience in this area as well as consultant academic training in this field of expertise.  The primary consultant must hold Ph.D. in organizational psychology.  The primary recipients of the NIDA leadership training are physicians and research scientists.  The Ph.D. credential makes the trainer more creditable to a scientific audience.  As a research organization all of the NIDA staff participating in this training are research scientists.      

38.	Solicitation Item # 3 states: “ Once the Competency Model has been approved the vendor will design training that will help select group (7) to become effective leaders. “ Are there 7 distinct groups of leaders? If not, please clarify the meaning of 7. 
39.	7 is the number of participants in the pilot program.  Each person is a senior management official at NIDA.  Each person is considered a group leader for his/her area of expertise (i.e. division or branch/section chief – IRP only).

40.	Is it your intention to have the vendor recommend the number and length of trainings? Or is there a set-amount of time for these trainings to be scheduled over the next year? 
41.	Our intention is to limit this offering to a 1 two-day pilot program (7 participants) followed by a separate  two-day roll out program (20 participants). Follow-up one-hour individual phone coaching sessions as needed can be priced per our per participant. 


42.	Do you expect to use an online 360 degree feedback instrument? Or would you prefer paper based? Online or hard copy is acceptable.


43.	Do you want a separate technical and price proposal? No

44.	The solicitation states: “…the vendor must furnish as part of their quote all descriptive material necessary for purchasing activity to determine whether the products meet all salient characteristics of this requirement.”  Would you please clarify in detail this statement? In addition to the quotation, all vendors must provide detailed information how the company can best meet the Government’s requirement

45.	Do you have a specific methodology in mind that you want the vendor to use in developing the competency model? If yes, what is the methodology? NIDA does not have a leadership competency model.  One of the goals to be achieved through this procurement is the development of a customized competency model that will be consistent with the current organizational leadership style and values.  The competency model will be designed based on current management practices that have been determined to be effective in both the public and private sectors.   

46.	We would like to use new technology instead of the MBTI and FIRO-B.  Can we substitute the Xyting Insight assessment?  NO

47.	 Do you want us to follow all the requirements in the original solicitation plus the ones in the Amendment, or do you want us only to follow those in the Amendment (FAR 12.6 and FAR 13)?  FAR 13 only

58.	Is NIDA looking for a specific leadership training event, or an ongoing leadership curriculum? Not ongoing – specific training targeted toward leadership (i.e. managing people).  Most of the NIDA senior management are Ph.D.s and/or M.D.s neither of whom have specific training in leading organizations.

The planned MCS system shall include a Roll-On/Roll-Off (RORO) MF, HF, FM, and Narrowband broadcasting system that is mounted on pallets that are loaded on a C-130J Aircraft.  These transmitters shall only employ Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) technologies because the overall goal of this procurement is to utilize COTS equipment while reducing space, weight, and power and increasing transmitter efficiency through use of solid-state technology that still meets all threshold requirements with minimal modification.   The specifications for the transmitter systems are intended to fulfill requirements for the MCS aircraft mission with options for additional system based on funding.  The specific amount solicited for MF/HF transmitter system includes three sets each of the MF and HF transmitters for the MCS aircraft mission and training.  There is an option for 2 sets of each to be exercised within 15 months of the contract award and an option for 3 sets of each to be exercised within 30 months of contract award.  The system for the MCS aircraft will be used for communication over long distances from an aircraft to civilian and military personnel on civilian commercial radio bands and on military frequencies in use for both ground and air.  The solicited MF/HF transmitter system will be frequency agile and shall be capable of providing sufficient power output through a trailing wire or fixed antenna system.  Each transmitter will be capable of 10 kW peak-to-peak power output (THRESHOLD).  The AM Broadcast transmitter shall be capable of transmitting a continuous wave (CW) or analog audio signal over the AM broadcasting frequency range from 450 kHz to 1700 kHz.  The HF transmitter should be capable of AM/CW/SSB/ISB modulation over the frequency range of 1.7 to 30 MHz.

<DESC>Questions and Answers:
Question #1: Is it truly a requirement to have RvA accreditation in addition to ANAB (formerly ANSI-RAB) accreditation?
Answer #1: NADEP JAX seeks both RvA and ANAB for business purposes.  As mentioned in the PSOW paragraph 1.2.4, the Depot’s customers include the following countries:
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Republic of Kuwait, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, NATO, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States of America.

Question #2: Does a registrar (certification body) having ANAB Accreditation to provide ISO 9001:2000 and AS9100-2001 certification / registration, satisfy the accreditation requirements cited in the mentioned solicitation? Or will not having RvA accreditation (for ISO 9001:2000) impact a registrar's technical rating assigned to its proposal?
Answer #2:  NADEP JAX seeks certification/registration under ANSI-RAB accreditation for AS9100-2001 and certification/registration under RvA accreditation for ISO9001:2000 for business purposes.  Therefore, both RvA and ANSI-RAB Accreditations are required for a pass rating for this technical subfactor. 

Question #3:  With regards to corporate or individual-site certificates,  the solicitation seems to infer that it will be a single certificate (NADEPJAX) with the detachment facilities coming under this certificate? Is this correct?
Answer #3:  Yes, a Corporate certificate is sought for the Depot and detachment facilities. (Depot-Wide)

Question #4:  Will Section 7.3 of the Statement of Work (Design responsibility) be excluded from this requirement(that NADEPJAX does not do parts design)?
Answer #4:  7.3 is included.  It applies to NADEPJAX’s organizational functions that deliver design services to their external customers.  

Question #5: What are the Employee levels at each facility?
Answer #5:  Please see Tables 1 and 3 of the PSOW. 

Question #6: In the case of a Corporate certificate, not all detachment facilities would normally be audited semi-annually. Is the intent for all detachment facilities to be audited semi-annually also?
Answer #6:  All detachment facilities are to be audited ANNUALLY consistent with the Corporate certification standards. The Depot is to be audited on a SEMI-ANNUAL basis.
