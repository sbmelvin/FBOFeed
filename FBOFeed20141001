<p>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The Objective of this effort is to meet the intent of the USAF Energy Strategy Plan. The Air Force is working to identify best practices and implement solutions to improve its energy security posture. The topics below are the potential areas that will be the focus of the upcoming BAA.</p>
<p>1) Improved mission planning and operations. Fuel efficiency initiatives -- improvements to flight control software to reduce fuel burn, technologies to improve operations or training to reduce fuel use such as flight test application to measure, track and record fuel efficiency parameters. Fuel conscious mobility requirements and mission planning and execution, Airspace utilization and efficient navigation, avionics upgrades for tighter vectors. Real-time fuel optimization (consumption/emissions) using advanced intelligent control systems.</p>
<p>2) Advanced light-weight materials or weight reduction strategies. For example, review and reduction of required cargo or logistics materials, fuel ballast reduction, alternative structure materials for KC-135 floor replacement.</p>
<p>3) Airframe Aerodynamic efficiencies, Drag Reduction. For example, drag reduction devices (finlets/mircovanes) for C-17, Advanced drag reduction techniques for the C-130 (winglets, tanklets, ullage utilization, conformal antennae).</p>
<p>4) Traditional alternative energy demonstrations, such as reduced or net zero installation energy use, implementation of renewable energy, or innovative energy efficiency strategies that will illustrate cost savings. For example, peak load shaving study, demand-response, or utilization of vehicle to grid operations to offset utility costs; Flight Line Operations Energy efficient technologies to replace existing flight line assets, ground support energy, industrial process energy; Electric power AGE equipment, advanced batteries, or micro-generators.</p>
<p>5) Radar Efficiencies and Effectiveness, Energy-efficiency improvements to large remote radar systems, R&amp;D for radar or software upgrades for better performance near wind farms to reduce mission risk. For example, develop validated tool for AF to respond to the 2011 NDAA Sec 358 that requires DoD to scientifically evaluate mission impact of encroaching projects.</p>
<p>6) Propulsion improvements to the legacy fleet offer the potential of large energy savings for the Air Force. Industry regularly updates its fleets with improvements to fan, turbine section, seals, combustors, generators, gearboxes, and improved lightweight materials and these mature technologies could be used to upgrade Air Force systems. Technology also exists to improve the energy efficiency of unmanned systems. Technologies include conversion of aircraft to logistically supportable fuels, improvements to engine fans, turbine sections and combustors, and the use of lightweight materials. In addition, improved batteries and fuel cells have been demonstrated to reduce energy requirements for small UAV's in deployed applications.</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY: It is anticipated that a BAA providing more details into this program will be released in late October 2014 to early November 2014. The BAA will be made available at www.FedBizOps.gov.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-14-01737 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<RESPDATE>101614
<CONTACT>Christopher Lee, Phone (310) 653-4764, Email christopher.lee.44@us.af.mil - Doreen Grosvirt-Dramen, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-3295, Email doreen.grosvirt-dramen@us.af.mil
<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice of Contracting Action</span><br /><br />The US Air Force Defense Support Program (DSP) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to Northrop Grumman Electronics System (NGES) for the follow-on contract to the current DSP On-orbit Support and Sustainment Contract (DOSSC) to provide factory and operations site(s) support and sustainment to the on-orbit DSP satellite constellation, with a period of performance beginning in FY 15 with one six-month&nbsp;base&nbsp;award and four (4) one-year options. This will be a sole source action, and the RFP will be issued no earlier than 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA).
<p>The statutory authority for this action will be contracting by Other than Full and Open Competition, 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Specifically, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) states that services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of the follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>A Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Sources Sought notice requesting Statements of Capability (SOC) for this requirement was published 10 January 2013. The title of this posting was "Defense Support Program (DSP) Sustainment Contract (DSC) follow-on contract to the DSP On-Orbit Support and Sustainment Contract. The proposed effort will begin on 1 Oct 2013 and continue through 30 Sep 2018 (Basic with four priced one-year options)." The solicitation number was "DSC." Another FBO Sources Sought notice was published 2 October 2013 entitled "Defense Support Program (DSP) Sustainment Contract (DSC) follow-on contract to the DSP On-Orbit Support and Sustainment Contract. The proposed effort will begin on 1 Oct 2013 and continue through 30 Sep 2018 (Basic with four priced one-year options)."</p>
<p>The DSP mission uses highly technical non-imaging infrared and other sensors to detect ballistic missile launches, space launches, endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear detonations, and reports them to US and allied forces and assets deployed worldwide through the Integrated Tactical Warning and Assessment (ITWAA) configuration control processes. The DSC will require the following support: (1) Technical support to operational missile warning on-orbit constellation satellites, trending analysis, performance and data archive, as well as the training of new personnel; (2) Space based non-imaging infrared mission performance assessment for real-time mission support and infrared event data analysis; (3) Operational satellite and payload anomaly support to include root cause determination and implementation of corrective actions; (4) Contractor facility supporting on-orbit operations (either from the factory or at the ops site) must be Defense Security Service (DSS) certified and capable of processing classified information as required by the DSP constellation. The contractor retains responsibility for recapitalization and/or replacement of any hardware/equipment obsolescence throughout the duration of the contract; (5) Program support includes management of contractor team and contract/business operations segment to track financial issues and deliverables; (6) Capability to develop software tools and implement command plans; and (7) Support at various government sites.

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for&nbsp;the provision of cable supply, installation and maintenance.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) have a facility security clearance at the level of SECRET, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and 2) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government. In addition, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances at the level of SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NCI Agency the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-14-12-NCIA-NCMO and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>Partial bidding will be allowed. Companies can bid for the cable supply contract or the installation and maintenance contract or both.</p>

<p>The NCI Agency is the provider of NATO-wide IT services and state-of-the-art C4ISR capabilities, including cyber and missile defense. In strengthening the Alliance, the Agency applies industry best practices and provides a full life-cycle approach; from analysis and concept development, through experimentation and capability development, to operations and maintenance for both missions and exercises.</p>
<p>The Agency has a requirement to procure cable supply, installation, and maintenance. The purpose of the contract is the provision of materials and equipment and installation, maintenance and troubleshooting of the IT infrastructure on SHAPE premises and buildings.</p>

<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>

Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable. Adopting healthy behaviors such as eating nutritious foods, being physically active and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or control the devastating effects of these diseases.</p>
<p>CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) is at the forefront of the nation's efforts to prevent and control chronic diseases. The center conducts studies to better understand the causes of these diseases, supports programs to promote healthy behaviors, and monitors the health of the nation through surveys. Critical to the success of these efforts are partnerships with state health and education agencies, voluntary associations, private organizations, and other federal agencies. Together, the center and its partners are working to create a healthier nation</p>
<p>CDC supports a variety of programs to improve the nation's health by preventing chronic diseases and their risk factors.

<p>The CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) accomplishes its mission by providing national leadership in areas of health promotion and chronic disease prevention by conducting public health surveillance, epidemiologic studies, and behavioral interventions; by disseminating guidelines and recommendations; and by assisting state health and education agencies to increase their capacity to prevent chronic diseases and promote healthful behaviors.</p>
<p>The mission could not be accomplished without many diverse partners: state and local health and education departments; other federal health agencies; international and national health organizations; academic institutions; philanthropic foundations; industry and labor groups; and professional, voluntary and community organizations. NCCDPHP works with partners to develop, implement, and promote effective prevention efforts nationwide.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">The Maternal and Pediatric Infectious Disease (MPID) Branch, of the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Eunice Kennedy Shriver </em>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate a modification to Contract No. HHSN275201300003C entitled, "NICHD International and domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Studies Coordinating Center," to increase the negotiated level of effort to WESTAT, Inc. Under the ongoing contract, the NICHD requires continuous and recurring logistical, technical, and administrative support to maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of domestic and international<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>clinical centers conducting research on treatment, prevention, diagnosis, epidemiology, and natural history of HIV infection and disease and its infectious and non-infectious complications in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations as well as other high priority infectious diseases affecting children and pregnant women in resource limited countries (e.g. tuberculosis, malaria).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>WESTAT furnishes all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities needed to implement, maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers to conduct current and future activities described above.</span></p>

Awarding a new contract to another contractor would require it to duplicate the infrastructure for participant recruitment in multiple clinical trials, provide another database for data collection, and provide additional laboratory services, etc. This would be highly inefficient and would not allow the project to continue uninterrupted. Multiple clinical trials are already in place in both international and domestic sites, extensive resources have been used to prepare the research sites for recruitment and study activities and training for all staff on current data systems and study procedures. Almost all of this work would need to be duplicated, if additional labor hours had to be purchased elsewhere. This would result in unacceptable delays and increased costs to the government. In view of its experience with the activities under the current contract and its existing infrastructure, Westat, Inc., is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work.</span></p>

<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), intends to procure a Test Fixture Winch that meets the specifications below. The following is specifically required:</p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>The required winch will be secured onto a concrete pad at the foot of a hollow 80 foot tall steel fixture. The winch wire rope will be fed from the winch through the top of the fixture and down to the test item that is resting inside and at the bottom of the fixture. The winch then hoists the 9000 pound test item up 40 feet. The test item will remain suspended near the top of the fixture for up to 2 hours until final preparations are made. <br />A customer supplied release mechanism near the top of the test item and attached to the wire rope then remotely releases the 9000 pound test item, which will fall 40 feet inside the fixture to hit the bottom. The winch will need to handle this sudden load release without damage to the winch and/or integral wire rope guides/pulleys.</p>
<p>Winch Performance Specifications:</p>
<p>1. Wire Rope Winch (supplied without wire rope; government will supply their own)<br />2. Winch shall be securely base mountable to a concrete pad (to be mounted by government)<br />3. Winch shall be removable from concrete pad to allow storage inside when not in use<br />4. Winch shall have guards to protect operators from mechanical and electrical hazards<br />5. Winch shall have no sharp edges, projections or hinged devices that could injure personnel<br />6. Winch shall have means to be electrically grounded with a 1 Ohm maximum resistance<br />7.

Smooth Drum for &frac34;" diameter wire rope<br />10. Winch drum shall hold at least 250 feet of &frac34; inch diameter wire rope<br />11. Minimum winch load rating of 12,000lbs at 100' lift<br />12. 208V Three Phase Electric Winch Motor<br />13. Motor shall be fully enclosed and weather proof<br />14. Motor shall be capable of operating under 12,000 lb load during full time of lift without over heating.<br />15. Winch shall be a dual or variable speed, power up and power down system<br />16. Maximum lift speed: approximately 10 feet /min<br />17. Minimum lift speed: approximately 2 feet / min<br />18. Winch shall have mechanical fail-safe features that prevent an unplanned release of the wire rope while the load is suspended.<br />19. Once suspended the lifted Item will be dropped using a vendor supplied quick release mechanism; therefore any braking mechanisms on the winch must be able to be released after the load is released from the hook.<br />20. Winch shall have upper and lower adjustable, geared limit switches<br />21. Winch shall be able to be remotely controlled with a 30 foot (minimum length) cable. <br />22. Winch shall be provided with necessary electrical devices to meet above control requirements.<br />23. Winch shall have outdoor, corrosion resistant winch finish.

purchase this part from additional sources. It has been determined to be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the data. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer the part. Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly
broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content
for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator.

<DESC>By way of this Notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Norfolk District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intentions to award on a sole source basis, a follow on Firm Fixed Price Architect-Engineering Contract to Jacobs/Ammann & Whitney (Jacobs), a joint venture, 299 Madison Avenue, Suite 1, Morristown, NJ 07960-6166.  Jacobs, as Designer of Record (DOR), completed the 100% design documents for the Millennium Expansion project located at Arlington National Cemetery (ANC), Arlington, Virginia.   <br>  <br> Through the issuance of W912DS-10-D-0002-EA01, Jacobs as Designer of Record (DOR) completed the 100% design documents for the Millennium Expansion project located at Arlington National Cemetery (ANC), Arlington, Virginia.  The follow-on contract is necessary to complete the required DOR construction phase services associated with the construction of the project as well as to address evolving project requirements through supplemental design services integrally linked to the original full design, as required.  Jacobs will not perform work for any other project or program under this specific contract action.   <br>  <br> The work will consist of performing the necessary AE construction phase services, including site visits, responding to Requests for Information (RFI's), reviewing shop drawings and providing technical assistance to the construction contractor.  Work will also consist of supplemental design labor as required for the Millennium Expansion Project at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia in strict compliance with the requirements included in the approved DD Form 1391 for the project and the 100% design already completed by Jacobs.   <br>  <br> Background:  The Millennium Expansion is a 27-acre expansion project at Arlington National Cemetery to provide nearly 30,000 burial and niche spaces to the cemetery. The project was initiated in the late 1990s when Congress identified a need for expansion of Arlington National Cemetery. Original design proposals developed in 2006 posed a significant environmental impact to the surrounding areas which was met with significant public opposition. Alternative designs were developed between 2006 and 2010. As part of this initiative, the Army Corps of Engineers Norfolk District was tasked with procuring a new, more environmentally-friendly design for the Millennium Expansion which incorporates as much of the existing  quote mark Arlington Woods quote mark  as possible. This project required extensive consulting with local, state, and federal agencies and organizations in the development of the design. The design retains as much of the existing vegetation as possible, including all trees greater than 145 years old, and incorporates new native vegetation. Jacobs developed the full design under contract W912DS-10-D-0002-EA01 issued on 08 August 2012. To date, there have been 12 modifications to the contract bringing the total dollar amount of the contract to $4,042,792.27. The final, stamped design documents for construction were completed on 3 June 2013. The period of performance for this existing task order ends on 17 December 2017 to accommodate the full construction schedule of the project. The capacity available under the current IDIQ contract vehicle is exhausted.  Additional work is required to continue to support construction efforts through the completion of the project in accordance with the project management plan. <br>  <br> The Classification Code for this procurement is North American Industry System (NAICS) 541330, with a small business size standard of $15 million. <br>  <br> This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.  However, all potentially responsible sources may submit a response NO LATER THAN the close of business on October 14, 2014.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Statements should be sent to the attention of Paula M. Beck at paula.m.beck@usace.army.mil; ensure that the subject line of your email included the title/description of this announcement. <br>  <br> Award is anticipated of said contract on or about November 30, 2014.  This announcement is posted in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The point of contact for this action is Paula M. Beck, Contracting Officer at 757-201-6244.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION
<p>The United States Air Force Installation Contracting Agency's (AFICA) Furnishings Commodity Council is in the process of developing a strategy for procuring unaccompanied housing (dormitory) furnishings. The chosen strategy would provide an enterprise-wide, continental United States (CONUS), excluding Alaska, solution for unaccompanied housing furniture.</p>
<p>The Air Force has structured this Request for Information (RFI) to target industry responses on general programmatic questions, manufacturer demographics, and product line capabilities. The attachment was developed based on analyzing the Air Force's unaccompanied housing soft good needs, anticipated product demands and current procurement processes.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>To aid in the development of the acquisition strategy, the AFICA Furnishings Commodity Council is investigating the capability and capacity of unaccompanied housing furniture manufacturers, furnishing trends, as well as any cost saving opportunities. Currently, the Air Force has 71 CONUS procurement offices buying unaccompanied housing furniture with a historical spend of approximately $12M annually.</p>
<p>The current program strategy focuses on two distinct product categories. The first product category is Hard Goods, which currently consists of case good dormitory bedroom furniture (headboards, beds, dressers, desks, etc.) and common area furniture (sofas, loveseats, dining tables, lounge chairs, etc.). The second product category is Soft Goods, which currently consists of bedding, draperies, and mattresses. Presently, the AF plans to award separate contracts for the Hard Goods and Soft Goods categories.</p>
<p>This RFI is focused on the SOFT GOODS product category.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

We highly encourage all interested manufacturers to provide a complete and thorough response to this RFI; however not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website for future information pertaining to this potential requirement.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Air Force Furnishings Commodity Council is requesting your input to gather information to help us refine our requirements and to identify qualified manufacturers who might be able to meet our future requirements. This RFI allows manufacturers and/or dealers the opportunity to provide input and recommendations consistent with their product line offering, industry trends, and cost saving suggestions. All manufacturers and/or dealers with an appropriate product relating to the questions set forth in the Soft Goods Matrix attached hereto are invited to provide data on the capabilities of your company. In addition to the attached documents, please provide a point of contact (POC) if the AF requires additional information from your company.

<p>This Sources Sought Notice is relative to the NAICS code 511210. The Small Business size standard for this NAICS code is $35.5M. Large and Small Businesses are invited to answer this market survey to determine market capabilities.</p>
<p>Hurlburt Field, FL, is conducting market research to determine the existence of potential sources to provide Special Tactics Operations Workflow Application.</p>
<p>The potential requirement will consist of the contractor providing all of the following:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>STTS requires a robust, workstation independent, computerized workflow system specifically suited for the scheduling and tracking of special operations ground forces training. This application is desired to improve efficiency, reduce errors and cut manpower hours spent on scheduling events, personnel, and equipment between the directorate of training, operations shop and the combat support team.</p>
<p>This system should utilize a calendar that serves as the focal point to assign and manage assets and manpower. The product should provide an adaptable framework that supports future capability upgrades, such as: tracking trainee task completion and resource shortfalls; storing metrics for analytics; producing concepts of operations and warning orders; and allowing for digital signatures of required training documents. Due to the mobility of instructors operating at dislocated training events, this product should be a web application which is available for use on a mobile device such as a laptop or personal digital assistant (i.e. Android, Blackberry or Apple cellular phone).</p>
<p>A user should be able access the application based on a Common Access Card (CAC) authentication method which verifies their right to use the system. In addition, it should assign the user appropriate roles and responsibilities to manage their section, but allow views to all sections' requests and to the availability of all assignable resources.</p>
<p>The infrastructure the application operates on should be accessible by a developer who can test, install and upgrade the software quickly. This allows for deployment of new capabilities and fixes to emerging requirements in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Additionally, the desired system should be capable of storing, processing and serving unclassified information at NIST level III to maintain the OPSEC of our training schedule dates, times, locations, equipment and of our personnel's information (i.e. name, rank, email addresses and phone numbers). Finally, the system will need to be fully accredited or certified.</p>
<p>OVERALL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The program will act as the scheduling function for all aspects of an operation. For a given event, the program shall include support fields such as: number and type of radio Communications gear required; number and type of life support equipment (parachutes, flotation devices, oxygen, etc) required; number and type of dive gear required; number and type of supply equipment required; number and type of vehicular equipment required; number and type of weapons and ammunition required; number and type of information technology equipment required.</p>
<p>The program should store, organize, display, and update the above data fields as required.<br />The program should provide an intuitive interface that quickly integrates updated values to the above data fields.</p>
<p>Solution is available to inspect and test immediately, in order to both verify functionality and ensure high ease-of-use.</p>
<p>Solution can be in use within two weeks of contract award in order to mitigate rapidly expanding STTS operations workflow requirements.</p>
<p>Categorizes users by role, with roles identified for Event Schedulers (e.g. instructors), Ops (e.g. coordinators), and Support Department Personnel (e.g. supporters).</p>
<p>Enables Instructors to create training events and to initiate supporting requests for those events. The quantity for each support request should allow a setting of "per student" or "per event". The "per student" requests should auto-update when the student count itself changes.</p>
<p>Default views for Coordinators should encompass all events and support requests.</p>
<p>Default views for Instructors should be constrained to only their flight/course. Broader data, like the list of all command events, should be optionally available. Status indicators should be based on the states of all requests for each given event.</p>
<p>Default views for Supporters should be constrained to the events and requests that directly impact the individual Supporter. Weapons personnel should not have to shuffle through Comms requirements in order to discover what requirements have been asked of Weapons. Status indicators should be based on only the requests that pertain to the given department.</p>
<p>Each item request should have an audit log showing the date and nature of each change, the current state, and the user who was responsible for the change.</p>
<p>Support Centers should be able to bulk upload their inventories via a CSV upload capability.</p>
<p>Modifying support requests should "do the right thing" in terms of modifying the state of a given request. Reducing the required quantity for a confirmed request should leave the request in its confirmed state. Increasing the required quantity of a confirmed request should remove the "confirmed" state in favor of "changed" or the like. Similarly, requests that have been rejected should remain so if their quantities are increased, but revert to "changed" if their quantities are reduced.</p>
<p>Instructors should be able to see events from other courses if desired, and be able to request to "piggyback" some or all of their students onto another course's event. This piggyback request should require the approval of an instructor from the course to which the event belongs.</p>
<p>Approved piggyback requests should auto-generate the same per-student support requests as exist for the event's parent course.</p>
<p>Vendor that has previous experience working with SOCOM and AFSOC so as to facilitate integration of SOF-specific terminology and operating requirements.</p>
<p>Vendor (or vendor's team) will be required to obtain an ATO prior to operational use of the system, and should have experience successfully navigating the ATO process, specifically:</p>
<p>Understanding of DoD Risk Management Framework (DoDI 8510.01: RMF for DoD IT) Assessment &amp; Authorization (A&amp;A) requirements (and/or DIACAP equivalent).</p>
<p>Previous experience obtaining commercial cloud based A&amp;A (or DIACAP equivalent).</p>
<p>Identifying Security Control and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Identifying activities required to maintain ongoing assessment (Continuous Monitor).<br />Creating and uploading of A&amp;A artifacts to the eMASS site.</p>
<p>Experience with cloud-based system architecture used to satisfy specific Security Controls such as CooP, Disaster Recovery, Back-up, etc.</p>
<p>Experience with overall design of highly available, highly-reliable, and secure cloud-based networks/systems and tying design back to Security Controls.</p>
<p>NOTE: Please submit electronic response indicating capability to supply the aforementioned item(s) via line card or published description (no more than 3 pages) as well as POC (name, telephone # and email address) along with contractor's CAGE, DUNS, and the physical location of your facility to the individuals listed within this notice.</p>
<p>All work shall be performed at the contractor's facility. This request may not directly lead to a Request for Quotation/Proposal. Deadline for submission is 2:00 p.m. CST, 15 Oct 2014.</p>
<p>Required Information:<br />Any interested party who can offer all of the above may submit a written reply of not more than 3 pages, addressing each of the above items and defining how their location is capable of ALL of the minimum requirements listed above.</p>
<p>Response deadline: 2:00 p.m. CST, 15 Oct 2014</p>
<p>Where to send responses:</p>
<p>Electronically:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ) Maneuver Ammunition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, in support of U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC)-Automated Testing Systems Division (ATSD), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is currently seeking sources for the replacement/upgrade of digital test instruments for the Next Generation Automated Test System (NGATS). <br> This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought. In preparation for a possible future procurement, ACC-NJ is performing this Sources Sought to explore a breakout strategy for this requirement. ARDEC-ATSD is interested in exploring the market capability to support this effort and determine if a competitive environment exists. The Statement of Objectives identified under this Sources Sought is as follows: <br> STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES: <br> The ARDEC-ATSD objectives are to replace/upgrade digital test instruments in the NGATS. The current stock of digital test instruments utilized by the NGATS have reached the end of their life cycle and have become obsolete. This effort shall be used to acquire, validate and deliver the next generation of digital instruments to be used in the NGATS. <br> Through analysis, the Government has determined that supporting and maintaining the current digital instrument has become cost prohibitive and it would make economical sense to upgrade/replace the cards at this time. Upgrading/replacing the cards will greatly reduce the cost of ownership as well as provide additional test capability. <br> DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW): <br> The Draft Statement of Work (SOW) will be made available through the Procuring Contracting Officer upon request. To obtain a copy of the SOW, interested sources shall submit a valid DD Form 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, a fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and an AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire. In addition, each company shall include the following information as a part of their request for SOW: company name, address, Cage Code, DUNS number, company size, business point of contact, and technical point of contact.  <br> Interested parties shall submit a brief capability statement, no more than five (5) pages, demonstrating how they are capable of meeting this requirement.  Standard corporate brochures are not desired.  The capability statement should include the following:  company name, address, telephone number, email address, technical point of contract, DUNS number, Cage Code and company size (please specify as either a Large Business, Foreign-Owned Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business), and technical description of ability to meet the requirement.    <br> In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all contractors wishing to do business with the Department of Defense must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). This registration can be accomplished at the following website: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. Therefore, all interested and potential firms must be registered in SAM, and current firms must update their registrations regularly to reflect the most current company information and to maintain active status ensuring registration does not expire. Whether applying for assistance with awards, contracts, or other business opportunities, all entities are considered registrants. Registration in SAM in no way guarantees that a contract or assistance award will be issued. The following information is required to register in SAM: DUNS Number; Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Taxpayers Name; statistical information about your business; and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Information.  <br> This Sources Sought is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be published. If a RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. The Army is not seeking, and will not accept, unsolicited proposals.

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE<br />Runzheimer International LTD - SS-CFPB-15-0002
<p>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), intends to contract with Runzheimer International LTD. - 1 Runzheimer Pkwy., Waterford, WI 53185 on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for a subscription to Runzheimer data. Runzheimer International LTD has been identified as the only source capable of providing the required content in an arrangement that suits the needs of the CFPB.</p>
<p>Runzheimer International LTD provides very specific Cost of Living Standards Reports that will be used in CFPB's locality pay program. Runzheimer data is used by peer FIRREA agencies and, due to CFPB's comparability mandate and the unique relationship CFPB has with other FIRREA, it is necessary to use the data provided by Runzheimer.</p>
<p>Runzheimer International is the only vendor that provides the Cost of Living Standards Reports data analysis that is utilized by peer FIRREA agencies. While cost of living data is available via open market, the analysis of that data that peer FIRREAs utilize is not. In order for CFPB to comply with the Union Agreement and be comparable to peer agencies, the same data analysis must be utilized.</p>
<p>The identified contractor, Runzheimer International LTD is currently the only source for the subscription.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by October 6, 2014 @ 3:00 pm ET.</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted electronically to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attn: DHolbert, CGropp.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The WFIRST Mission <P> The primary purposes of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission are to determine the nature of the dark energy that appears to be driving the current accelerating expansion of the universe, to perform statistical census of planetary systems through a micro-lensing sky survey, to perform a general survey of the NIR sky, and to provide the astrophysics/astronomical community with a space telescope for stable wide-field observations.  WFIRST will perform Hubble-quality imaging over thousands of square degrees for 5 years (10 year goal) in a geosynchronous orbit.  WFIRST will settle essential questions in both exoplanet and dark energy research and will advance topics ranging from galaxy evolution to the study of objects within the Galaxy and within the Solar System. It is the top-ranked large space mission in the New Worlds, New Horizon Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics. <P> The WFIRST will perform wide-field imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys of the near infrared (NIR) sky for the astrophysics community by integrating the existing, repurposed 2.4m Astrophysics Focused Telescope Asset (AFTA) with a Wide Field Imager (WFI) consisting of 18 H4RG HgCdTe detectors, a multi-filter NIR spectrometer, and a baseline exoplanet coronagraph for direct imaging of exoplanets and debris disks. Additional information regarding the WFIRST Mission can be found at <A HREF="http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/">http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ </A>  .   A write-up on the instrument can be found in the SPIE digital library:  D. A. Content, N. V. Armani, C. L. Baker, C. E. Jackson, Duncan M. Kahle, et al., Wide field instrument preliminary design for the wide field infrared survey telescope,  SPIE 8860 (2013) doi: 10.1117/12.2025496. <P> Information Sought <P> NASA is in the process of assessing industry capability for operationally low temperature (170K), lightweight mirrors and mounted mirror assemblies for the WFIRST Wide Field Imager (WFI).  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to: <P> 	Identify potential industry interest in providing Engineering Development Unit (EDU) and Flight Model (FM) low temperature M3 mirror and/or M3 mounted mirror assembly for the WFIRST WFI. This information will be used for internal requirement trade studies, information and procurement planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of WFIRST M3 requirements, and to promote competition <P> 	Assess current industry capabilities to design, develop, qualify and deliver a WFIRST low temperature lightweight M3 mirror or M3 mounted mirror assembly based on the preliminary requirements provided in Table 1 <P> 	Understand implied cost and schedule drivers and candidate cost/schedule/ performance trades to be considered in procuring and M3 mirror or M3 mounted mirror assembly <P> 	Ensure a complete M3 mirror/mounted mirror assembly trade space is defined for material selection, mount configuration, coating selection, mirror design/fabrication/test,  and any other new/novel approaches that might add scientific and/or economic value to the WFIRST mission <P> 	Obtain cost and schedule rough order magnitude (ROM) estimates from potential mirror and mirror assembly providers.  These data are to be used solely for internal budgetary planning purposes and will not be used to pre-select or rank potential suppliers for any future procurement <P> NASA is particularly concerned about the control of low temperature mirror mounting strain, gravity release error (factory to orbit), and mirror substrate CTE non-uniformity. <P> Response Instructions <P> To consolidate our planning, responses from industry are requested by Friday, October 24th, 2014 in the form of written and illustrated concepts, ROM estimates for development costs and schedule, assumptions used for cost and schedule ROM estimates including interface and design assumptions, and descriptions of capabilities as appropriate to the preliminary requirements outlined in Table 1.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is for market research purposes to determine what capable businesses are available that can support our 27 NOAA All Hazards Radio (NWR) transmitter sites in the State of Colorado. The government is anticipating a base year with four additional one year option periods.
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a component of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with a core mission of protection of lives and property of the people of the United States and our territories. The NWS currently has 1,000 NWR transmitters operating Nationwide, and this network is our primary system of notification for general forecast data, watch and warning dissemination, Amber Alert dissemination, and natural or manmade disaster alert and dissemination to our customers, and is a integral part of or forecast mission and process. This network must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, with only limited service interruptions regardless of conditions at the transmitter site. <br /><br />Some of the potential work that may be required under these requirements would include all emergency corrective actions, regularly scheduled preventive maintenance actions, as well as facilities to house the equipment, logistics support, and a state wide Microwave communications interface so that we may disseminate watch warning and forecast data to the public we serve. A draft of the scope of work is attached.</p>
<p>Responses to this request for information shall not constitute responses to any request for quote, which is not currently available. No request for quote currently exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the request for quote. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely at the Governments discretion. This request for information is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Governments evaluation of the capability statement received may factor into whether any forthcoming request for quote will be conducted as a small business set-aside, full and open competition, or sole-source procurement.<br />Firms that believe they are capable and interested in providing these services may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. The capability statement shall be no more than ten (10) pages in length and shall address the following topics:</p>
<p>-Organizations name, Address, Phone Number, Email, and Point of Contact Information<br />-Brief summary describing your organization and how it fits into this requirement. <br />-Description of any work (similar to the governments requirements) done previously with name of business and organization, date of award &amp; completion, and estimate award value. <br />-Ability to provide all manpower, logistics and facilities resources to maintain the NWR transmitter and infrastructure to the response and restoration criteria defined in the attached statement of work.<br />-Ability to pass all security and background clearances in accordance with the US Department of Homeland Security, as well as the security requirements of the State and local governments required for the area of service. <br />-Indicate experience and working knowledge of moderate power (300W to 1KW) RF transmitters manufactured by Scientific Radio Systems (SRS), Armstrong, and Crown Electronics. Nautel, and Continental Electronics Corporation FM transmitters will be added to our fleet beginning FY 15, so the offeror will need to indicated experience on those brands of FM transmitters as well. <br />-Include your business size classification (e.g. large business, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc. for the GSA Schedule contract)</p>

This solicitation is entitled, "Strategic Planning, Comprehensive Space Analysis and Design, and Project Management Services." EPA's space is constantly upgraded and altered, the organizational structure of EPA continues to evolve, and its programs expand and contract, to continuously meet their mission requirements.  President Obama's June 10, 2010 memorandum, "Disposing of Unneeded Federal Real Estate," directed federal agencies to achieve cost savings by reducing operating costs, generating income through disposal of assets, and more efficiently using existing real property through consolidation of space.  To manage its space and rental obligations and to assist with the directive to reduce space, EPA requires contractor support services to perform space planning, analysis, design services and project management support for EPA projects both at Headquarters and throughout the 10 EPA Regions nationally. 
US EPA anticipates awarding a single sward Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with primarily time and material and some firm fixed price task orders. The NAICS code is 541611 (Small Business Size Standard $14 million). The solicitation is set aside 100% for small businesses.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notification was previously Posted under the PEO STRI BOP Opportunity Portal under number STOC II-14-KOP-0016. This new Sources Sought supersedes the STRI BOP Announcement and seeks further marketing research. <br> If you responded to the STRI BOP Announcement you will also need to repond to this announcement. <br>  <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is seeking capability information from industry for consideration during development of an acquisition strategy to obtain/ validate necessary data required to continue the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) analysis, design, development, integration, testing, security accreditation, fielding, installation, modifications, system support, training support, and sustainment for the Product Manager Warrior Training Integration Office (PdM WTI), a member of  Project Manager Constructive Simulation (PM ConSIM).   <br>  <br> BACKGROUND:  <br>  <br> The IEWTPT program is a Non-system Training Aids, Device, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) Program of Record (POR) that enables proficiency training for Military Intelligence Occupational Specialties, including but not limited to, collectors and analysts to exploit intelligence data in training events, just as they would in  quote mark real world quote mark  operations and supports the US Army Military Intelligence (MI) Training Strategy. IEWTPT fills a military intelligence (MI) specific war fighting function training gap at Home-station, Combat Training Centers (CTC's), and Reserve and National Guard locations supporting sustainment of critical individual, collective, and crew tasks/ skills. It is the key simulation enabler for MI personnel training currently supporting All Source, Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), and Geographical (GEOINT) and potentially Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT), Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), and Cyber Intelligence. IEWTPT trains/ supports collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination (PED) / cross-queuing of multi-discipline intelligence data supporting mission command and mission execution training events. IEWTPT provides War fighting Commanders at all echelons the ability to train the Intelligence War fighting Function (IWF) based on accurately portraying the operational environment by simulating the necessary attributes of that environment and stimulating MI war fighting equipment  where system operators and analysts are able to conduct their tasks and synchronize their Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets (in a training environment) to exploit training events intelligence data and provide the commander with required, timely, accurate, and executable intelligence information and products. <br>  <br> IEWTPT has three (3) primary components: Technical Control Cell (TCC) [SECRET to TS/SCI operations], Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Control Cell (HCC) [UNCLASS to SECRET operations], and Simulation Interfaces [aka. Target Signature Arrays (TSA's)].IEWTPT operates in conjunction with a number of complementary systems to include but not limited to: DCGS-A, TiGR, CPOF, CHARCS, TGS, PROPHET, etc. <br>   <br> This effort is for continued analysis, design, development, integration, testing, security accreditation, fielding, installation, modifications, system support, training support, and sustainment of the IEWTPT capability - including associated simulation interfaces - and the Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Control Cell (HCC) component of IEWTPT.  The current Technical Control Cell (TCC) is a processor  quote mark server stack quote mark  that creates a robust, realistic relevant target environment for high-fidelity training on Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems supporting the intelligence disciplines: All Source, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), which includes Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT); Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT);  Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT); and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).  IEWTPT supports intelligence sustainment training in all disciplines by leveraging the Live, Virtual, Constructive - Gaming training environments capabilities and generating and providing simulation-based sensor data feeds indistinguishable from  quote mark real world quote mark  systems. IEWTPT is expected to transition to a cloud-based solution in the near future.  The TCC has three (3) enclaves: the Lower Enclave (LE) (SECRET collateral), the Cross Domain Solution (CDS) (a.k.a Data Diode), and the Upper Enclave (UE) (Top SECRET (TS)/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI).  In addition to realistic simulation enhancements, it provides exercise control and support tools, scenario development capabilities, and AAR functions. The TCC has the capability to distribute the exercise simulations/ stimulation information to remote training locations via secure Army networks.  The current HCC is an interactive, avatar based simulator created for HUMINT Soldiers and used by multiple Army disciplines to sustain tactical questioning skills.  The soldier can run through any of the multiple scenarios available, questioning virtual humans in free flowing (non-scripted), realistic virtual environment in an attempt to extract mission-essential information.  The planning has begun for a cloud-based HCC capability.  The IEWTPT (in standard or tailored configuration) system is fielded to 27 CONUS and 6 OCONUS locations. <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:   <br>  <br> The Government anticipates an award in 3QFY16.

<p><strong>Location:</strong><br />Leasing Division</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong><br />Lease of Office Space in the area of Denver, Jefferson &amp; Arapahoe Counties, Colorado (Region 8)</p>
<p><strong>Description(s):</strong><br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities&nbsp;through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in October.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO OFFER:</strong> <br />The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at&nbsp;https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for October is <strong>October 1, 2014 to October 20, 2014, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.</strong> The AAAP will&nbsp;be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to&nbsp;award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple&nbsp;space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and&nbsp;related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During an Open Period,&nbsp;offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.<br /><br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through&nbsp;FY 2015 or until it is replaced.<br /><br />* NOTE: In order to allow sufficient time for offerors to familiarize themselves with the new Fiscal Year 2015 RLP&nbsp;and make any necessary changes to their offers, the open period for October will be extended. The open period&nbsp;for October will run from October 1, 2014 until October 20, 2014 at 11:59 pm (EST). The open period will return to<br />its normal 7-day length in November.<br /><br />If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow&nbsp;existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space&nbsp;will not be copied.</p>
<p><strong>OCCUPANCY:</strong> <br />Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of&nbsp;this notice.</p>
<p><strong>DELINEATED AREA:</strong> <br />All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following Counties: Denver, Jefferson and Araphoe County&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>LEASE TERM</strong>:<br /> Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes to identify interested vendors for the potential requirement detailed below. A formal solicitation and performance work statement are not available. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 19.5, Set-Asides for Small Business, the Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for access to updated database of oil and gas wells, reservoirs, and fields worldwide.  The Government anticipates award to begin May 30, 2015 for a Base Year with (4) optional 1-year periods.  The contractor shall meet or exceed all database requirements by May 30, 2015.  The contractors data shall be existing, updated at least annually, and made available by the Contractor to the USGS via CDROM/DVD, web service and oracle database formats, with retrieval, viewing and manipulation applications.  The contractors database shall consist of updated data on a minimum 4.5 million wells for the United States, 700,000 wells in Canada and 700,000 for the remainder of the world.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519190, All Other Information Services, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard is $27.5M.  The SBA Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) applies to this procurement.  
Historically, the database subscriptions have been procured from IHS Global, Inc., 15 Inverness Way E, Englewood, CO 80112-5710 which provided access to the following IHS database systems: E&P Data Worldwide Data including: Worldwide Cartography, Worldwide Fields / Field Images, Worldwide Wells, Worldwide Survey, and Enerdeq Desktop databases; Questor Offshore / Onshore S&M; IHS Enerdeq Browser; PI/Dwights Plus Well data - Total U.S.; PI/Dwights Plus Production data - Total U.S. (TX, LA Alloc); US PowerTools - Network License; and Petra S&M Network Perpetual. 
The IHS database systems are known to meet or exceed the requirements outlined below to provide detailed information on oil and gas exploration and production history for the United States, Canada and the World in support of Congressional Mandates to assess Undiscovered Oil and Gas Assessments.  The data must be consistently formatted and provided through numerous mechanisms to allow for easy search and retrieval of desired data. 
For the United States, the requirement is for detailed history of each well and production data for more than 4,500,000 wells from 1865 through 2015.  Well history must include well identifier (API), well name and number, location, total depth, operator, spud, permit, completion dates, target formation(s), formation tops, well status, well tests, and well physical descriptions.  USGS also require cross references to other data including: Cores, Well Log, Directional Surveys and Well Treatments.  Well history data must be consistently formatted for all wells throughout the United States in order to support studies that span numerous states.  Well Production must include volumes of oil, gas, natural gas liquid and water in a format that is consistent across the entire United States.  Production must include current well status, production tests, and other ancillary information that is reported to states.  The USGS requires extensive details of well fracturing treatments, including volumes of fluid injected, proppant weights, and water co-produced.  For states which report production on a lease level, the USGS requires the contractor to allocate to well level and provide documentation on allocation procedures.  Data must be updated on an annual basis, at minimum.
The USGS requires details on well history and production for Canada for more than 700,000 wells, from 1860s  through 2015.  This includes well identifier, well name and number, location, total depth, operator, spud, permit, completion dates, producing and target formation(s), well status, reported production volumes, well physical descriptions and field names.  Also needed are well pressure tests, pool analysis data and analysis software for Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.   Data must be updated on an annual basis, at minimum.
For other (excluding Canada and US) international data, the USGS requires detailed history for more than 700,000 international wells, from 1860s through 2015.  Well history must include well name and number, location, total depth, operator, spud, permit, completion dates, target formations, well status, well tests, well physical descriptions and associated field names.  The USGS requires a compilation of international oil and gas fields, including location, reserve estimates, production details, development history, typical geochemical composition and associated geologic descriptions.  Data must be updated on an annual basis, at minimum. The USGS requires efficient software interfaces to search and download these data.  Such software must allow query by all the attributes described above including:  Well identifier, name, geographic location, penetrating depth, producing formation, producing volumes, perforations, well status, operator, various dates, well type and well tests.   This search should be complimented with a map-based search and query interface and allow exports into a variety of industry-specific data formats, including 297 Well and 298 Production.  The USGS requires programmatic access to the data including:  local physical copy in Oracle database tables, web service access and web mapping service access.  
The USGS requires extensive documentation on the methodology for compiling information, including details on currency of updates, a detailed data dictionary and direct access to contractor management to ensure the USGS is effectively using the data.  
All business concerns who believe they can responsibly perform this requirement should submit the following information to the contracting officer no later than 1700 ET Monday, October 27, 2014 :

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 

The Department of Veterans Affairs Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy program (CMOP) is in the process of obtaining and evaluating industry capability in developing Consumer Return Medication Envelopes (mailback envelopes). 

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recently published regulations to implement the 2010 Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act. Prior to publication of these regulations, ultimate users could return non-controlled medications but could not return controlled substance medications. This rule allows ultimate users to return both controlled and non-controlled medications per defined methods. One of the methods in the regulations allow for ultimate users (e.g. patients) to return their unused and unwanted medications to a DEA authorized "collector" for destruction using a mail-back envelope. A DEA distributor or reverse distributor authorized to conduct a mail-back program, may provide mail-back envelopes to a third party to distribute to ultimate users. 

Any interested Contractors must fully comply with the following regulations: 

1.	An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) Security Rule, October 2008

2.	Homeland Security Presidential Directive (12) (HSPD-12), August 27, 2004


3.	http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-09-09/pdf/2014-20926.pdf

Disclaimer: The following requested information to be provided is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, Request for Quotation, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.

The services are for 161 Commissary located in the United States. The current contractual arrangements limit DeCA's abilities to efficiently and effectively manage the recycling program. DeCA, therefore, seeks out a solution that would better support its current and foreseeable customer needs. After the results from the RFI are submitted and analyzed DeCA will determine if an industry day is necessary and will invite interested companies to participate.

<DESC>The U.S. Forest Service, Contracting East, intends to award a sole source contract to Highland Trucking for snow plowing services from Forest Rd. 22 and the Walton Snow Park.<br /><br />This is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal. This synopsis of intent is to give notice of the Government's intent to make a sole source award. <br /><br />The State of Oregon and the U.S. Forest Service, Ochoco National Forest operate under a formal agreement which authorizes the removal of snow accumulations from Forest Rd. 22 and the Walton Snow Park. <br /><br />The period of service corresponds to the dates covered under the permit system. Within these terms, the Forest Service awards an annual contract for performance of snow removal services.<br /><br />Craig Woodward (Highland Trucking) also has an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service, Ochoco National Forest to plow Forest Rd. 42 to Big Summit Prairie where the Woodwards maintain a private residence. To facilitate this mutually- benefitting service, the Forest Service allows Mr. Woodward to park his snow removal equipment, which consists of a State surplus highway snowplow, grader, and front-end loader, at the U.S.F.S. Ochoco Ranger Station. This location is central to both Roads 42 and 22.<br />Due to this unique arrangement, the following benefits accrue to the Forest Service in awarding the snow removal contract to Mr. Woodward:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) No mobilization costs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Equipment capable of managing sudden, extreme accumulations of snow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Guaranteed availability of equipment and operator<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Personnel already on site during peak weather conditions, qualified to&nbsp;&nbsp; gauge necessity of service and respond accordingly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Knowledge of the road; where to pile snow, areas prone to ice; shoulder drop-offs, traffic trends, local weather patterns, historical use by wildlife, and other hazards<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) Experience and Equipment which minimize the hourly cost to the Government<br /><br />This contract has previously been awarded to Highland Trucking after competing the requirement.
<p>In doing so for several consecutive years, it became apparent that no other local source could be responsible in comparison to Highland Trucking, given their unique positioning and experience at the contract performance location.<br /><br />The estimated total of the requirement is $11,400.00.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Date posting will close: 15&nbsp;OCT 2014. The responses to this synopsis will be used to confirm that this is a sole source requirement. This notice is not a Request for Proposals (RFP); it is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to awarding the contract. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this notice of proposed contract action. Contractors who believe they possess the expertise and experience shall submit technical capabilities in writing to Kevin Toombs, AQM - Contracting East, USDA Forest Service, 3160 NE 3rd St, Prineville, OR. 97754, or electronically to: ktoombs@fs.fed.us. Responses must be received no later than 16:30 p.m. PDT 15&nbsp;OCT 2014. All documentation shall become the property of the Government. Firms responding must indicate the following information: Indicate the business size: small business or disadvantaged business, veteran owned small business or HUB Zone certified. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research.</p>

All attendees must submit a Visit Authorization Request Form (VAR) to the Applied Research Laboratory of Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) by 03 November 2014 for unescorted access via JPAS and SMO 6D012.&nbsp; VARs can be addressed and faxed to David Howard at 814-865-3738.&nbsp; All visitors and their security personnel can contact David Howard at 814-865-9584 or dkh19@arl.psu.edu to check receipt of their VARs.&nbsp; For any questions or to resolve any problems for attendance to this Industry Day, please contact Nicholas Minovich at nicholas.minovich@navy.mil and/or Daniel Georgiadis at daniel.georgiadis@navy.mil.&nbsp; Check-in will occur between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.&nbsp; Attendance is limited to no more than four individuals per organization, and it is encouraged to include at least one Chief Engineer or Technical Lead.&nbsp; All attendees will be required to present a Government issued photo identification to obtain the visitor IDs.&nbsp; The CAT Industry Day Conference will be UNCLASSIFIED.&nbsp; At this time, national policy does not support participation in this Industry Day Conference by foreign sources.&nbsp; Please RSVP no later than 03 November, 2014 to nicholas.minovich@navy.mil. RSVPs received after 03 November 2014 will not be accepted and attendance will be denied.&nbsp; There is no registration fee for attending this Industry Day. <br />&nbsp;<br />Attendees with the appropriate clearance will be given the opportunity to attend an ARL/PSU tour of the Engineering Development Model (EDM) development facility. This tour will be classified at the SECRET level and is only open to U.S. citizens with a current U.S. SECRET clearance.&nbsp; Shuttle transportation to and from ASB to the EDM development facility for the tour will be provided.
<p>The PMS 415 ATTDS Industry Day will provide industry a general technical overview on the All-Up Round Equipment (AURE), the high level requirements, and the five subsystems of the CAT.&nbsp; The intent for this Industry Day is only to familiarize industry with the program and is strictly technical in nature.&nbsp; Details pertaining to the specific procurement actions such as the acquisition strategy and the Request for Proposal will not be provided at this Industry Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PMS 415 has been tasked to develop a surface ship anti-torpedo hard-kill capability for High Value Unit platforms (Carriers and Combat Logistics Force ships).&nbsp; This capability will be developed through two separate but associated programs: the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) and the CAT. The TWS will serve as a standalone detection, alert and tactical control system, and will provide the detection capability necessary for the ship to evade, decoy, or defeat the torpedo using existing or future tactics and countermeasures in addition to the CAT.&nbsp; The CAT will be developed separately as a hard-kill countermeasure.&nbsp; TWS and CAT are associated but independent acquisition programs, each with its own defined mission.&nbsp; The CAT will continue development as a common counter-measure for all platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CAT consists of the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) and the AURE.&nbsp; The ATT is a small-diameter, quick-reaction hard-kill torpedo countermeasure used to disable incoming threat torpedoes.&nbsp; The ATT will search, home, terminal home, and fuse on its target using technology developed under sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research.&nbsp; It consists of the following 5 major sections: Nose, Warhead, Command &amp; Control, Powerplant and Tail.&nbsp; The ATT is housed in an AURE, which consists of a thin-walled composite canister, electrical cabling to enable communication between the ATT and fire control, and energetics for launching the ATT and the ATT canister.</p>
<p>The resultant capabilities of the ATTDS family of systems will be integrated into an open architecture designed system leading to the demonstration of an anti-torpedo detection and track for TWS and hard-kill engagement for CAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this Industry Day Conference.&nbsp; This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.&nbsp; The Government will not award a contract resulting from this conference.&nbsp; There will be no opportunities for questions or discussions between individual industry representatives and Government technical Program Office representatives during the conference.&nbsp; However, the Government will provide industry the opportunity to document UNCLASSIFIED questions that arise during the conference on forms supplied at the conference.&nbsp; The Government will collect all index cards prior to the conclusion of Industry Day.&nbsp; In addition, electronic mail questions received prior to and after the Industry Day will be accepted by the NAVSEA Contract Specialist Lisa Sherman at lisa.sherman@navy.mil.&nbsp; Responses to written questions will be provided via follow-up electronic posts to FedBizOpps.&nbsp; The Government is not committed to respond to any questions.</p>
<p>Please note that industry participation is voluntary and the Government will not reimburse attendees for any efforts expended as a result of or in response to this notice.&nbsp; If you are interested in this program, it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>

All attendees must submit a Visit Authorization Request Form (VAR) to the Applied Research Laboratory of Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) by 03 November 2014 for unescorted access via JPAS and SMO 6D012.&nbsp; VARs can be addressed and faxed to David Howard at 814-865-3738.&nbsp; All visitors and their security personnel can contact David Howard at 814-865-9584 or dkh19@arl.psu.edu to check receipt of their VARs.&nbsp; For any questions or to resolve any problems for attendance to this Industry Day, please contact Nicholas Minovich at nicholas.minovich@navy.mil and/or Daniel Georgiadis at daniel.georgiadis@navy.mil.&nbsp; Check-in will occur between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.&nbsp; Attendance is limited to no more than four individuals per organization, and it is encouraged to include at least one Chief Engineer or Technical Lead.&nbsp; All attendees will be required to present a Government issued photo identification to obtain the visitor IDs.&nbsp; The CAT Industry Day Conference will be UNCLASSIFIED.&nbsp; At this time, national policy does not support participation in this Industry Day Conference by foreign sources.&nbsp; Please RSVP no later than 03 November, 2014 to nicholas.minovich@navy.mil. RSVPs received after 03 November 2014 will not be accepted and attendance will be denied.&nbsp; There is no registration fee for attending this Industry Day. <br />&nbsp;<br />Attendees with the appropriate clearance will be given the opportunity to attend an ARL/PSU tour of the Engineering Development Model (EDM) development facility. This tour will be classified at the SECRET level and is only open to U.S. citizens with a current U.S. SECRET clearance.&nbsp; Shuttle transportation to and from ASB to the EDM development facility for the tour will be provided.</p>
<p>The PMS 415 ATTDS Industry Day will provide industry a general technical overview on the All-Up Round Equipment (AURE), the high level requirements, and the five subsystems of the CAT.&nbsp; The intent for this Industry Day is only to familiarize industry with the program and is strictly technical in nature.&nbsp; Details pertaining to the specific procurement actions such as the acquisition strategy and the Request for Proposal will not be provided at this Industry Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PMS 415 has been tasked to develop a surface ship anti-torpedo hard-kill capability for High Value Unit platforms (Carriers and Combat Logistics Force ships).&nbsp; This capability will be developed through two separate but associated programs: the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) and the CAT. The TWS will serve as a standalone detection, alert and tactical control system, and will provide the detection capability necessary for the ship to evade, decoy, or defeat the torpedo using existing or future tactics and countermeasures in addition to the CAT.&nbsp; The CAT will be developed separately as a hard-kill countermeasure.&nbsp; TWS and CAT are associated but independent acquisition programs, each with its own defined mission.&nbsp; The CAT will continue development as a common counter-measure for all platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CAT consists of the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) and the AURE.&nbsp; The ATT is a small-diameter, quick-reaction hard-kill torpedo countermeasure used to disable incoming threat torpedoes.&nbsp; The ATT will search, home, terminal home, and fuse on its target using technology developed under sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research.&nbsp; It consists of the following 5 major sections: Nose, Warhead, Command &amp; Control, Powerplant and Tail.&nbsp; The ATT is housed in an AURE, which consists of a thin-walled composite canister, electrical cabling to enable communication between the ATT and fire control, and energetics for launching the ATT and the ATT canister.</p>
<p>The resultant capabilities of the ATTDS family of systems will be integrated into an open architecture designed system leading to the demonstration of an anti-torpedo detection and track for TWS and hard-kill engagement for CAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this Industry Day Conference.&nbsp; This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.&nbsp; The Government will not award a contract resulting from this conference.&nbsp; There will be no opportunities for questions or discussions between individual industry representatives and Government technical Program Office representatives during the conference.&nbsp; However, the Government will provide industry the opportunity to document UNCLASSIFIED questions that arise during the conference on forms supplied at the conference.&nbsp; The Government will collect all index cards prior to the conclusion of Industry Day.&nbsp; In addition, electronic mail questions received prior to and after the Industry Day will be accepted by the NAVSEA Contract Specialist Lisa Sherman at lisa.sherman@navy.mil.&nbsp; Responses to written questions will be provided via follow-up electronic posts to FedBizOpps.&nbsp; The Government is not committed to respond to any questions.</p>
<p>Please note that industry participation is voluntary and the Government will not reimburse attendees for any efforts expended as a result of or in response to this notice.&nbsp; If you are interested in this program, it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>

It supports corrosion control and structural maintenance operations for F-16 aircraft and support equipment assigned to the 354 FW as well as tenant/transient aircraft. There have been repairs and modifications (paint booths, mezzanine) made to the facility since original construction. No asbestos or lead-based paint is expected present. The facility currently has a fire alarm system, but system components are obsolete and repairs are made difficult due to lack of adequate parts. This leaves the building and contents at risk of loss due to inadequate protection.</p>
<p>This is a competitive selection process in which competing offeror's qualifications will be evaluated in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 36.6 to determine the most highly qualified firms. The Government intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price contract.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 36.603(b): To be considered for architect-engineer contracts, a firm must file with the appropriate office or board the Standard Form 330, "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part II and when applicable, SF 330, Part I. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this posting; all costs associated with responding will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Failure to respond to this post does not preclude participation in the subsequent technical evaluation so long as a firm's SF 330 is currently on file with the 354th Contracting Squadron. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a 100% Small Business set-aside. The NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a small business size standard of $14M. The Disclosure of Magnitude for this A&amp;E project is between $25,000 and $100,000 IAW FAR 36.204(b).</p>

Developing design concepts and cost estimates <br />5. Submitting an investigation report<br />6. Attending review meetings<br />7. Making the revisions requested by the Government<br />8. Submitting intermediate design documents<br />9. Producing a complete design (65%, 95%, and 100% submissions)</p>
<p>A-E EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS: A-E's experience shall include that which is commensurate with the requirements specific to the scope of design.</p>

Course content is intended to provide foreign affairs professionals with a framework for thinking about the future of diplomacy over the next 10-15 years so they are prepared to identify key global technology changes and paradigm shifts, analyze the implications of those changes, and create responsive strategies that seize opportunities and mitigate threats.
<p>To support this purpose, the course may incorporate new technologies themselves into the classroom structure and format to take advantage of learning that such technologies can inspire while also serving as formative ways to understand experientially the impact of such new technologies.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair of aircraft composite panels. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010002 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-76. Contingent upon availability of funding, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the fully capable small business repair vendor that quotes the lowest technically acceptable total price that includes all panels. With exception of the Aircraft OEM, a capable repair vendor must be already deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore, to be considered, must have previously approved repair data and/or processes, and be able to certify that all work will be conducted at their facility and no other facility. Due to time constraints, vendors who do not meet the capability requirement, or who have not been previously determined capable, will not be considered and should not respond. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future award consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide OEM or Technical Repair Manuals or OEM Repair Data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to their current previously approved process(s). Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is EADS CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICASS.A. DBA EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical repair cost. This is an SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Composite Panels.
<p>See attached STATEMENT OF WORK with panels listed.</p>
<p>ATTACHED INFORMATION PACKET: the applicable intended commercial firm fixed price repair/overhaul addenda, applicable alternative Not-To-Exceed repair /overhaul addenda, and the quote evaluation process statement and support information, is provided for vendor review as one attachment to this combined synopsis/solicitation as posted in WWW.FBO.GOV</p>

<p>(a) Prohibitions.<br />Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Information and Technology (IT) Team, the Software Engineer will support USPSC employees and program operations by developing and supporting OTI web applications that in turn support program implementation staff in the field. Members of the IT Team work in a fast-paced environment and support the full development life cycle. The team has daily interaction with both state-side and international users, and gain a wealth of experience learning to implement or backstop all of the various facets of a small-scale yet modern web application. Our portfolio of applications manages DC-based operations, as well as small grant programs implemented throughout the world in support of USAID's mission, containing a robust geospatial element.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

For an offer's submission to be determined  quote mark Technically Acceptable quote mark  and receive consideration for award based upon lowest price submitted, the offer must receive a rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  for each technical acceptability standard and past performance factor.  The Government will award the contract to the offer that meets all the evaluation criteria with an  quote mark Acceptability quote mark  rating, and has the lowest price.  Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors are not permitted.   <br>    <br>  A price analysis of the proposals received will be in accordance with the techniques of FAR Part 15.404.  As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the offeror's final option period prices to the offeror's total price.  Thus, the offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, first option period, second option period, third option period, fourth option period, and one-half of the fourth option period.  Offerors are required to only price the base and four options.  Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential one-half year extension of services period.  <br>    <br>  In the event of an unacceptable past performance evaluation rating for an otherwise technically acceptable low price offeror, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will be contacted for a Certificate of Competency (COC) determination in accordance with procedures in FAR 19.601.  In the event an offeror receives a rating of  quote mark unacceptable quote mark  for both the Technical Acceptability Factor and Past Performance Factor, a COC determination will not be requested as the offeror would remain  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  based on the evaluation of the Technical Acceptability Factor.   <br>    <br>  Discussions or Negotiations:  The offeror's initial offer should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.602 and final offers will be evaluated in accordance with factors as were initial offers.    <br>    <br>  Award for All of the Work:  The Government intends to award one contract as a result of this solicitation.  Offers received with less than the stated number of items listed in the Bid Schedule will be considered non- responsive.    <br>    <br>       a.  Evaluation Criteria.     <br>    <br>  		(1)  Evaluation criteria consist of factors and elements as listed below.  The offers will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors:    <br>    <br>  Factor I:   Technical Acceptability  <br>    <br>  Acceptability Standard 1: Experience  <br>  			Acceptability Standard 2: Capability   <br>    <br>  		Factor II:  Past Performance 							  <br>    <br>  			Within the Past Performance (Quality of Products/ Services, Timeliness of Performance, and Business Relations will be evaluated) .  <br>    <br>  		Factor III:  Price  <br>    <br>  		(2)  Factor I -Technical Acceptability:  The Technical Acceptability Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the offeror's capability to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.    <br>    <br>  Acceptability Standard 1:  Experience: The offeror demonstrates experience in performing the requirements identified in the PWS.  The offeror shall submit a list of recent (within the past 5 years) and relevant contracts/subcontracts that demonstrate an ability to perform the work described in the solicitation.  Specifically, the orders/contracts should demonstrate five years experience in preventive maintenance and repairing of hoist and cranes.   	  <br>    <br>  Acceptability Standard 2: Capability:  Offeror shall provide official documentation to support the certification, licenses, or training documentation to confirm qualifications/experience as outlined in the solicitation, paragraph   <br>    <br>  The Technical Acceptability Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.  The individual standards will not receive an adjectival rating.   <br>    <br>  Table 1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings  <br>  Rating	Description  <br>  Acceptable	Offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>  Unacceptable	Offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>    <br>    <br>  		(3)  Factor II - Past Performance:  The offeror shall submit a list of recent and relevant past contracts/subcontracts as defined below.  The past performance evaluation will assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror's recent past performance and focusing on past performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's submission and data obtained from other sources, such as the Contractor Past Performance Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.  <br>    <br>  Each offeror will receive a past performance rating of acceptable or unacceptable based on the Offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.    <br>    <br>  			(a)  Recency Assessment:  An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.  <br>    <br>  			(b)  Relevancy Assessment:  To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity.  The Government will conduct an in depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the offeror's (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of an offeror's contract history would give the most confidence that the offeror will satisfy the current procurement.  The past performance information provided in the offer and obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance.  <br>    <br>  The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to past performance rating.    <br>    <br>  Assigning Ratings.  The Past Performance Factor will be assigned one (1) of the rating defined below.   <br>    <br>  Table 2: Past Performance Evaluation Ratings  <br>  Rating	Description  <br>  Acceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.  <br>   Unacceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,  quote mark unknown quote mark  shall be considered acceptable.  <br>    <br>  		(4)  Factor III: Price:  The Price factor will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b). Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.  <br>    <br>  			(a)  Options.  Pricing submitted for the Offeror Schedule, will be evaluated for price reasonableness.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's total price, to include the base period, first option period, second option period, third option period, fourth option period, and one-half of the fourth option period, using price analysis techniques (See FAR Clause 52.217-8).  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an offeror to be considered for award.  Those offerors not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  The Government will award a single contract to the offeror whose offer represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable offer.  <br>    <br>  			(b)  Unbalanced Pricing.  Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 14.209-(2),  Cancellation of Invitations before Opening, it has been determined that inadequate or ambiguous specifications were cited in the Statement of Work and it is in the Governments best interest to cancel Solicitation Number A14PS00970-IT Support and Services for Haskell Indian Nations University. It was Determined that cancellation of any solicitations which had used the same approach would be more prudent then proceeding with a questionable or flawed Statement of work.  This will allow the government to re-evaluate its procurement method prior to releasing a new solicitation.

<DESC>FBO OMAO10-2015CM2 Questions &amp; Answers from Sept 30th Site Visit
<p>1.	Will a Travel Lift be available onsite to relocate the vessels? <br />a.	No</p>
<p>2.	Can the vessels be transported via towing in the water?<br />a.	The launches could be towed but a plan b should be in place as we did not test water tight integrity when the plugs were installed.</p>
<p>3.	  Are the boats turn-key as they sit presently?<br />a.	As the boats sit, they are NOT turn-key.  They have been winterized with all fuel and fluids removed and are still on blocks.</p>
<p>4.	Are sea trials expected upon completion? If so, who is authorized to operate the equipment and the vessels?<br />a.	Sea trials are expected.  One of the technical people will go with a qualified member of the FA to inspect the work and accept the launches.</p>
<p>5.	 Will the Government be disconnecting all electronics and electronic controls to prevent electrical surges during welding before work commences on the vessels?<br />a.	As far as electronics, they have all been removed.  The technical folks are not sure about the electronic controls.  They can make this happen if it is a deal breaker.  The technical people plan on being active with the yard during the upgrades/repairs for any oversight and assistance.</p>
<p>6.	Do you have a schematic drawing of the vessels with exterior dimensions, weight etc.? <br />a.	Please see additional general launch drawings for your review.<br /> <br />Please update your bids with the information provided.</p>

<DESC>Please note the questions and answers below:<br /><br /><strong>Q1.</strong> Who will provide security for field visits?
<p><strong>A1.</strong> &nbsp;U.S. nationals traveling to Peshawar and the plant site shall be provided security by the Government of KP.  Key contractor personnel are expected to visit Peshawar for the kick-off meeting and final presentations.  Other than that, there will not be more than four meetings in Peshawar by two persons each over the course of the FS for finalizing the design work and the EPC RFP.  As far as visiting the plant site, PEDO advises that only the expat civil engineer would need to visit the site for a couple of hours to optimally lay out the site plan.  The rest of the expat contractor team would not need to visit the site.  <br /> <br /><strong>Q2.</strong> In terms of Task 2, FEED and Design of Combined Cycle Plant:  The last bullet in that section references a Geotechnical study.  As the contractor under this RFP, are we expected to establish the specifications for soil bore samples, or are we expected to perform these core samples?<br /><strong>A2.</strong> The Contractor shall do the bore holes physically as per the norms of engineering design. The Contractor shall establish specs &lsquo;before and after' the bores holes sample have been tested as per the loading scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Q3.</strong> With reference to Task 3, Environmental and Social Impact Assessments, will the consultant be expected to physically gather the data, or may we use general reference data from Pakistani government agencies?<br /><strong>A3.</strong> &nbsp;The Contractor shall use general reference data available with government agencies, academia and national and international associations &amp; entities for the region and specific place the GTCC will be established. However, some data has to be physically gathered by the Contractor as per standard industry practice for a feasibility study, not limited to flora &amp; fauna.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is providing draft requirements documents and a Waveform Survey for Manpack Radio for review and comment by industry. The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.      <br>          <br>     The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  These requirements have been extracted and collated in the Draft Performance Requirements Document (PRD) for the Manpack Radio Full Rate Production. The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.      <br>          <br>     Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.      <br>          <br>     Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Waveform Survey, as well as provide comments and questions on the attached Draft requirements documents, which include the Draft PRD, Draft Statement of Work, Draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs), and Draft Section H of the Uniform Contract Format (UCF).     <br>          <br>     All questions, comments, and questionnaire responses pertaining to the documents posted today and any further documents posted in the future via amendment to this notice, along with any questions from industry day shall be submitted no later than July 22, 2014, 12 PM ET to thomas.e.lynn23.civ@mail.mil.

Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.      <br>          <br>     All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked. Any documentation provided will not be returned.      <br>          <br>     This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future.

<DESC>Amendment 1 (10/1/14):&nbsp; The solicitation number for the subject requirement is changed from SPE1C1-14-R-0106 to SPE1C1-15-R-0004.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br /><br />The proposed RFP is for the Leather Gloves (NSN: 8415-01-394-0208 (s), PGC: 03999) to be made in accordance with Department of Agriculture, Forest Service specification 6170-5D. The solicitation will be issued as <strong>Unrestricted</strong>, and will be awarded under a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Type Contract. The resultant contract will be for a base year and four (4) one-year term options. The base year minimum quantity is 32,250 PR, and the annual order limitation quantity (AOLQ) is 161,250 PR. Each of the four one-year option terms will have a minimum quantity of 32,250 PR and AOLQ of 161,250 PR. All materials used in the fabrication of these items are to be furnished by the successful offeror.
<p>This procurement will utilize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable method of source selection. The objectives of the acquisition are met through determining offers technically acceptable. An offer will be determined Technically Acceptable when it meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation and takes no exception to any terms or conditions of the solicitation. Award will be made based upon the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. The following technical evaluation factors are anticipated:</p>
<p>1. Proof of ISO 9001 Certification.</p>
<p>2. Proof of NFPA 1977 Certification <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OR</strong></span> Proof of Application for National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1977 Certification.</p>
<p>3. Terms and Conditions: The offeror must meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation and take no exception to any of the terms or conditions. Each offeror must complete a clause checklist verifying that all listed clauses are completed in full. Failure to complete all clauses listed in the checklist may determine an offeror technically unacceptable.<br /><br />NFPA 1977 Certification is required prior to award. If the item fails NFPA 1977 Certification or if proof of NFPA 1977 Certification cannot be produced in the timeframe designated by the Contracting Officer prior to award, the Government will reserve the right to award to the next lowest technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p>Although Past Performance is not a technical evaluation factor, the Government reserves the right to review Past Performance when making a determination of responsibility. This may include the review of Past Performance data from other sources such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS); as well as information pertaining to production capacity, technical capacity, procurement history, financial capability, laws and regulations, and integrity and ethics.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be FOB Destination, Inspection and Acceptance at Origin. Initial shipment of this item is required 120 days after date of award. Subsequent delivery orders will have a production lead time of 90 days. Pre-production First Article samples will be required within 30 days. Destination: Tracey, CA.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this solicitation will be posted to the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) during or after September 2014. All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) in order to be eligible for award. All responsible sources may submit offers which shall be considered if received timely.</p>
<p>-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------</p>
<p>Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means that in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2013. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.</p>
<p>DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.</p>
<p>The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/</p>
<p>There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can use the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to a hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should use the Medium Token Assurance which is portable, similar to a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own. Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. <br />Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2. In order to register for access to secure portions of DLA DIBBS, the company you are representing must already be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. 3. A Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code registration will be processed immediately. A User ID will appear on the registration screen and a password will be sent separately to the email address of the Super User. If a CAGE is already registered on DLA DIBBS, the name and email address of the Super User will be provided. The Super User should be contacted to set-up additional accounts, logons and passwords for their CAGE. DIBBS Super User * If your CAGE has already been registered on DIBBS, the name and email address of the person designated as your super user will be provided. * The representative who starts the DIBBS registration process has the option to accept their CCR registration POC as the DIBBS super user, or they can designate themselves or another person to act as the super user for the CAGE. * The super user acts as the account administrator for a CAGE. They can add up to ninety-eight additional users, provide user IDs and passwords, modify existing users, and control the login status of each user for their CAGEs through My Account (Account Maintenance).<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx.<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment") impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.</p>

<DESC><div>The purpose of this amendment is to: 1) provide answers to questions received, 2) revise Attachment A - Statement of Work, and 3) correct the NAICS code in the Description field of the Notice.</div>
<div></div>
<div>1) The answers to all timely received questions are as follows:&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>1. Regarding the request to include a plan that compares methodologies for conducting the data collection strategies - which dimension(s) of data collection methodology are required to be included in the comparison? &nbsp;E.g. data source, techniques for linking data system, data entry mechanisms etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The requested plan would include techniques for linking the data from multiple sites into a single data system and to a smaller degree data entry mechanism. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Will MCHB share with applicants the approaches to data collection and "data repository" that the awarded regional sites will use at this time?&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The awarded regional sites are not currently using approaches to data collection and "data repository" at this time. &nbsp;Each awarded regional site will work with HRSA and the awarded contractor to develop the approaches to data collection after the contract has been awarded.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3. Can an institution applying for the regional site participate in the National Coordinating Center?&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>4. Can an individual at an institution applying for the regional site be a subcontractor in the National Coordinating Center?&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yes, an individual at an institution applying for the regional site can be part of a subcontract to the National Coordinating Center or a consultant to the NCC as long as the individual's job description on each of the application is distinct (different) and mechanisms are put in place to clearly distinguish the roles and financial compensation to the individual on each funding stream. (For clarification, subcontracts are usually made to companies and individuals are consultants.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>5. Is there a requirement for OMB approval of the data collection?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yes, there is a requirement for OMB approval for the data collection. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>6. Task 3.3 Base Year states that the database the contractor creates "shall also be able to collect general information about the patient population, including demography information, geographical information, and information about services delivery." Please clarify whether this information must be at the level of data protected under HIPAA, or whether it can be deidentified or less granular?</div>
<div></div>
<div>All information collected by the contractor from the regional sites will be de-identified or less granular data. &nbsp;The general information obtained about the patient population should be collected in a manner to allow HRSA to understand the need of the patient population, but should be de-identified so as to limit the ability of identify individuals.</div>
<div></div>
<div>7. Does HRSA anticipate that they will convene an external review committee or will the review occur internally within HRSA?&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Review will be conducted based on the evaluation criteria contained in the solicitation. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>8. Can a representative from a federal agency serve on the oversight steering committee?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Neither the authorizing legislation nor MCHB has language that would prevent a representative from another federal agency from serving on the oversight steering committee. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>9. When does MCHB anticipate announcing the funding of the awards?&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>This award will be funded at the end of this fiscal year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>10. Is there any requirement that the National Coordinating Center for the Treatment Demonstration Program should also collaborate or exchange data/resources with the National Coordinating Center for the New Born Screening Program?&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>No, there is no requirement that the National Coordinating Center for the Treatment Demonstration Program should collaborate or exchange data/resources with the National Coordinating Center for the Newborn Screening Program. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>11. Do the regional coordinating centers have any requirements pertaining to the development of the congressional report?</div>
<div></div>
<div>No, the regional coordinating centers do not have any requirements pertaining to the development of the congressional report. &nbsp;The regional coordinating centers have requirements pertaining to developing data strategies and collecting and sending data to the National Coordinating Center. &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>12. Would it be possible to offer subcontracts to academic institutions and other individuals with unique expertise without a small business contracting plan?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yes, if the prime contractor is a small business, a subcontracting plan is not required. However, a subcontracting plan would be required if the prime is a large business, and the proposed total contract value exceeds $650,000.</div>
<div></div>
<div>13. Under Task 6.3 Report to Congress and Task 6.4 Presentation to MCHB Staff, the "Hemoglobinopathies Learning Collaborative" was mentioned. &nbsp;This Learning Collaborative was not mentioned previously; does it still apply? &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>No, the mention of the Hemoglobinopathies Learning Collaborative &nbsp;was an error. &nbsp;Please disregard all mention of the Hemoglobinopathies Learning Collaborative.</div>
<div></div>
<div>14. In the Schedule of Deliverables table, Clause F.6 of the RFP, Option Years 1 and 2, the Delivery Date of 5.1, Web-based Compendium of Tools and Materials, is 1 month prior to the end of Option Year 1 (and 2). &nbsp;However, in Attachment A - Statement of Work, Task 5 (in both option years) states that the Web-based Compendium of Tools and Materials shall be delivered two months prior to the end of each Option Year. &nbsp;Please clarify the schedule for submission of the Compendium of Tools and Materials.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The correct schedule for the submission of the Web-based Compendium of Tools and Materials should be one month prior to the end of each Option Year. Please see the revised Attachment A - Statement of Work attached.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2) Attachment A - Statement of Work is hereby revised in response to Question 14 above. Task 5.1 in Option Year 1 and Option Year 2 is corrected to reflect the correct submission date for the web-based Compendium of Tools and Materials. The attached, revised version should replace, in its entirety, Attachment A in the document RFP.SCDTDP.docx included in the Base Notice.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3) The NAICS code in the Description field of the Base Notice is hereby changed from 611710 to 541990. The NAICS code listed in the General Information side bar is correct, and remains unchanged.</div>

<DESC>The synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov.
<p>Modification 0001 is being issued to provide an answer to a question received.</p>
<p>Question: Can you provide the model of the system for the following item: SAS/SATA Hard Drive Caddy/Tray, 2.5" SAS Tray Caddy, KG7NR, Dell, 25</p>
<p>Answer: The Hard Drive Caddy (Dell Model # KG7NR) is designed to hold a 2.5" SAS drive. The sequence is to install a 2.5" SAS drive into the Dell caddy and then install the Dell caddy into a Dell PowerEdge R620.</p>
<p>Since the manufacturer and associated model numbers were provided as an example of items that meet the required performance specification. If a different manufacturer than the Dell example, then the hard drive caddy needs to hold a 2.5" SAS drive and fit in that specific computer chassis.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>

<div>3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drawing of space offered.</div>
<div>4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ANSI/BOMA defined Office Area Square Feet.</div>
<div>5) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per square foot; specifying &nbsp;services, utilities, and tenant improvement allowance included.</div>

<div>8) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Name, address, telephone number, and email address of individual to be contacted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Submissions by other than the owner or manager of a property must be accompanied by a letter from the ownership granting permission to make a general offering of space. &nbsp;In instances where the Offeror is representing more than one property, the Offeror is hereby notified that they may only participate in negotiations on behalf of one owner. &nbsp;Please include reference to 4MA0194.</div>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform the consultation with affected Native American Tribes as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Museum Curation support, except for those items specified as Government furnished items and services.  The Contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.Task #1:  Native American Tribal Consultation;This project supports the continued Government-to-Government relations with Federally-Recognized Native American tribes, including discussions regarding Traditional Cultural Properties/cultural resources Native American tribes are concerned with on Air Force lands or lands potentially impacted by Air Force missions and operations.  Kirtland Air Force Base has ongoing Government-to-Government relations with 24 Federally-Recognized tribes (20 Pueblos and 4 Apache Tribes) SAF/IE policy letter dated 6 May 2014,  quote mark Government-to-Government Relations with Federally-Recognized Tribes quote mark , establishes requirements for installation commanders, or their designated O-6, to conduct tribal meetings on a twice a year basis.  The AF goals are to increase the effectiveness of AF consultations with federally-recognized tribes, increase collaborative planning between tribes and installations, and more fully meet the requirements and intents of federal laws that require federal agencies to consult with tribes concerned about natural and cultural resources on agency lands.The contractor shall organize and coordinate bi-annual meetings between the installation commander and the Federally-Recognized tribes, based on the installation commander's and tribal schedules.  The meetings will be conducted at alternate locations such as on the installation, on the tribal grounds or at a mutually agreeable neutral location.  The contractor will provide a conference room, applicable brochures and slides, tours of the installation when conducted on the installation, and snacks and drinks.  The contractor shall coordinate with the installation Tribal Liaison and the tribal intermediate for scheduling the dates, times and locations of the bi-annual meetings.The contractor shall develop and design a Bi-annual Meeting Facilitation Plan which will establish the foundation for future meetings.  The plan will establish, organize and facilitate meetings between closely affiliated tribal representatives and the installation commander or their designated O-6 or appointed Tribal Liaison, either on the installation, at the tribal offices, or at a neutral location.  The Bi-annual Meeting Facilitation Plan is to include relevant laws, histories, regulations and outlines/synopses of successful Tribal Relations at other DoD installations.  The program will be well and clearly written, concise, free of jargon, with all acronyms spelled out at first use.  The goal is to produce a concise, highly useable document that will provide clear guidance in planning, organizing, and conducting tribal meetings.The contractor shall use the Plan and data gathered to create a customized program that will guide planning, organizing, facilitating, and reporting on the leadership meeting.  All specifics of the meeting, such as length (hours and days), protocols, appropriate gifts, time and place for prayers and blessings, refreshments and snacks, seating arrangements, room setup, break and meal locations, security, evening activities, etc., shall be outlined in the customized program.At the meeting itself, the contractor shall facilitate the meeting, ensuring minutes are taken, proper protocols for addressing tribal leaders and military leaders are known and followed, all equipment is functional, and the schedule is followed as closely as possible without the rigidity that might offend tribal leaders.  The facilitator shall be sufficiently experience to recognize and deflect tension, gently keep the participants moving forward, and to provide and maintain a friendly professional meeting throughout. <br> The customized program document forms the foundation for the draft and final Tribal and Installation Commander Continuity Book.  The intention is to produce a high quality, easily useable, easily modified, continuity document that provides a record of the meeting and a comprehensive guide for future meetings.  Specific details of the Continuity Book, such as whether it is in paper, loose-leaf form, electronic, both paper and electronic, etc., and to whom it should be submitted when final, will be included in the Facilitation Plan.	The Continuity Book shall contain a list of the Federally Recognized tribes of New Mexico, which will be obtained from the New Mexico Indian Affairs Office, custom and feast days recognized by each tribe/Pueblo, tribal events the public can attend, and cultural differences when interacting with tribal representatives.  Kirtland AFB will submit a copy of the Continuity Book to the All Indian Pueblo Council annually, as a living document with the most up to date material on cultural and traditional activities, leadership changes and future meetings.Task #2:  Museum Curation;This task provides for support of transferring artifacts to the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico to curate and preserve in-perpetuity artifacts collected at Kirtland AFB.The Contractor shall coordinate transfer of the artifacts temporarily stored at Kirtland AFB and provide payment of fees with the Maxwell Museum for permanent storage of the artifacts.  For estimation purposes, assume that there will be three boxes of artifacts and the associated fees for permanent storage will be $1,000. <br>

Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is anticipated for the required brand name software licenses and maintenance.  VA currently utilizes 380,000 Lumension brand software licenses that perform necessary security monitoring functions.  The licenses are installed at various locations throughout VA.  VA's current endpoint security for PCs is comprised of only Lumension brand software and if another brand of software were introduced, there would be interoperability and compatibility issues with the existing software that VA currently owns and operates.  Specifically, any other brand name software would not be able to communicate with the existing software due to the proprietary technical data constraints of the software.  In addition, supporting multiple systems would require additional VA staff or contract support to maintain both systems. Only Lumension brand name software can ensure full interoperability and compatibility with the software currently in use.  Additionally, Lumension software is the only software that provides all VA required functional capabilities including enabling administrators to quickly establish and enforce device control policies by rapidly identifying devices and then assigning permissions at a high level or all the way down to a specific application per users, user groups or even a particular user;  preventing copying of private information and electronic Protected Health Information to all unauthorized removable media; ensuring non-intrusion to the existing computing environment and will not lock down communication channels or slow system performance; and allowing detailed configuration of color schemes and fonts necessary to meet Section 508 requirements for the sight impaired.  If VA were to switch to another product, then clients and servers would have to be removed and replaced within the entire VA, with no control over universal serial bus (USB) access.  As a result, anyone could easily plug in a device and potentially install a malicious application virus.  This poses serious information security issues because much of the information VA has on file is medical records and Personally Identifiable Information (PII), therefore it is necessary for VA to comply not only with the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act to keep data safe but to protect all Veteran data across the enterprise. 

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2), this action will be synopsized and the Justification for an Exeception to Fair Opportunity will be made publicly available within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  In addition, in accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A), this Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity will be posted on the NASA SEWP IV website with the solicitation.
7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any products and/or source providers available that will enable future requirements to be competed.

     8.  Market Research:  Market research for other sources/service providers was conducted in March 2014 to determine if the current Lumension software being utilized in VA can be supported by other service providers.  Specifically, the Government's technical experts reviewed similar software, McAfee, to see if it has the same functionality as the Lumension product.  Based on preliminary VA testing, McAfee software would not be able to communicate with devices using the existing 380,000 Lumension software licenses due to the proprietary technical data constraints of the software to perform the necessary security monitoring functions. Only Lumension brand name software can ensure full interoperability and compatibility with the software currently in use throughout VA at this time.

     Based on the above market research, it is determined that only Lumension software and maintenance support can be utilized as Lumension is the only supplier of software updates (to include enhancing and optimizing software, remedying defects; as well as provide all new fixes, patches, corrections, releases, updates, versions and upgrades to the current software) and technical support.

9.  Other Facts:  None.

1.  Contracting Activity:   Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                        Office of Acquisition Operations
        Technology Acquisition Center

2.  Description of Action: The proposed action is for a firm-fixed price (FFP) task order issued under the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Number 70 for 3M brand name hardware maintenance, enhancement, and support (MES) for VA's existing 3M AT9000 Full Page Reader/Scanner hardware and renew software licensing and maintenance for the Assurtec "AssureID" and "RevealID" software products. The Assurtec "AssureID" and "RevealID" software and 3M AT9000 Full Page Reader/Scanner hardware   are integrated components utilized for the current Personal Identity Verification (PIV) scanning and authentication solution. The proposed effort will be awarded under GSA FSS Number 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132-12, "Maintenance of Equipment and Repair Services." The performance period of this action shall be for a base period of twelve months with four 12-month option periods, if exercised.

3.	Description of the Supplies or Services: The proposed action is to renew brand name hardware MES for the existing installations of 3M brand, AT9000 Full Page Reader/Scanner and dependent software licensing and maintenance for the Assurtec "AssureID" and "RevealID" software products that are utilized for the Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) -12, PIV program.  The aforementioned combination of hardware and software support are specific to the PIV scanning solution which has been previously delivered to, deployed and is in use nationally within VA. These 3M scanners are currently in use as an enterprise, standards-based, multi-location, Identity Document Verification solution to help meet the HSPD-12 requirements for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The 3M brand name hardware MES includes troubleshooting of product-related problems; customer support via phone, web, and email; hardware warranty coverage; 24-hour advance replacement of defective parts; firmware and software maintenance and updates. The total estimated price of the proposed action (inclusive of options) is $ 

4.  Authority: The specific authority providing for a limited source award is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), "Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized." 
 
5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Based on market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is available among resellers of 3M hardware MES and AssurTec software. Utilizing any other brand name hardware MES does not afford the unique support mechanisms, such as vendor patches, firmware, driver and software upgrades and updated vendor technical data/support, necessary for functioning the PIV scanner integrated solution within VA's infrastructure.  Furthermore, the Government does not possess the proprietary technical data for the 3M scanners and associated AssureTec software.  Without this technical data, no other source has the ability to provide the aforementioned hardware MES services other than 3M or its authorized resellers. This proprietary technical data is needed to ensure that 3M's hardware MES provided meets VA's needs of ensuring the devices and associated software remain operational. 

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document in paragraph 8 below.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2)(i), this action will be synopsized within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available.  In addition, the ordering activity will post the justification along with the Request For Quotation to e-Buy in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(b)(3).  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition: In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered.

8.  Market Research: VA technical experts performed market research for other source/service providers in May of 2014 to determine if the current 3M hardware and software being utilized in VA can be supported by other service providers.  Due to the proprietary nature of the technical data, it was concluded that there are no other service providers that can provide the maintenance and technical support without the proprietary source code as outlined in paragraph five of this document.  3M or its resellers are the only sources that can provide maintenance and support of the 3M proprietary hardware MES and software products.

On June 30, 2014, a Request for Information was issued on the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Number 70 Special Item Number(s) 132-12 - Maintenance of Equipment, Repair Services, and/or Repair/Spare Parts and SIN 132-33 - Perpetual Software Licenses to determine if any potential sources existed for the required hardware and software MES. On July 7, 2014, one response was received from a GSA Schedule 70 holder, 3M Cogent, a large business. The Government technical expert determined 3M Cogent technically capable of meeting VA's requirements.  

9.  Other Facts: None.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires renewal of its subscription to Nuclear Intelligence Weekly electronic newsletter with Energy Intelligence.The Office of Information Services is responsible for the agency's Technical Library, which contains a collection of scientific and technical books, journals, reports, industrial codes and standards, and other materials. In addition, the Technical Library provides access to electronic databases, industry electronic newsletters, online codes and standards, electronic journals, CD-ROMs, and other relevant web resources. Specifically, the Technical Library provides access to Nuclear Intelligence Weekly electronic newsletter in support of the agency's regulatory and licensing mission. This newsletter is published on a weekly basis and is used by NRC staff to obtain knowledgeable financial, uranium and global fuel-cycle markets.This acquisition is conducted under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b). Energy Intelligence is the copyright holder, sole publisher and distributor of Nuclear Intelligence Weekly (NIW) electronic newsletter. This requirement and was publicized in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2. A Notice of Intent was posted to FBO.gov on 09/02/2014. No responses were received as a result of the notice. To ensure that the price to the Government for these services will be fair and reasonable, a separate price analysis will be performed by the Contracting Officer and award will only be made if the price is determined to be fair and reasonable. The COR conducted market research in May 2014. The research found that Energy Intelligence is the only publisher of NIW. There are no other organizations that can provide NRC with the same newsletter and therefore information without infringing on copyright. The NRC Acquisition Management Division will closely monitor requirements for any subsequent acquisitions to ensure that any restrictions to competition are adequately justified and to ensure that competitive procedures are used to the maximum extent practicable.

JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE: less than br greater than  less than br greater than The proposed work is to conduct maintenance and relocation of a light-field holographic display. All research and development of the display was conducted by Zebra Imaging, and the display is the first of its kind. At present there are no other light-field holographic displays that have been developed. Furthermore, Zebra has proprietary hardware and software incorporated into the light-field display including unique optics, spatial light modulators, computational layer, and holographic data computation software. The inner workings of the display and the software play a key role in the functioning of the display; without knowledge of these factors, the calibration and maintenance of the display is not possible. As a result, Zebra Imaging is the only company with the capability to calibrate and maintain the device. Furthermore, due to the proprietary hardware and software, only Zebra engineers would have the experience necessary to conduct the work. These components have been patented by Zebra and are included in their intellectual property. Due to these facts, a sole source award was deemed necessary.  less than br greater than  less than br greater than 6.  MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED/EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: less than br greater than  less than br greater than Matthew Hackett, a Science and Technology Manager with experience in holography and holographic displays conducted the market research during the month of January 2013 utilizing (1) online searches, (2) conference attendance, and (3) communication with other sources familiar with holographic displays.  (1) Online searches were conducted using the keywords digital holography, motion holograms, holographic display, and light field display.  The results of the information gathered found that there are other companies conducting research into holography, however none of the companies were developing a light field display. The companies used techniques such as multi-projectors for angular slices (Third Dimension Technologies Inc.) or were developing static holograms (Holoxica Inc.). Other companies such as Microsoft are also developing holographic displays, but are using a spinning mirror system, which is a vastly different display modality.  zSpace also provides a holographic display capability, but requires glasses in their configuration. Through the online searches, no companies had a holographic display configuration similar to the existing one to be maintained. As a result, none of the companies are familiar with the hardware and needed techniques to generate a light-field hologram.  (2) Conferences attended for research upon this topic included Digital Holography and 3D Imaging conference, which is the foremost conference in holography. I/ITSEC was also attended in hopes of looking for new holography vendors. At these conferences, a number of vendors were present, including Third Dimension Technologies and Infinite Z, but neither of these companies have the capabilities to maintain a lightfield display. (3) Other sources of information included discussion with other Government personnel, such as engineers at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) who are also currently conducting holographic research.   The information provided by AFRL engineers confirmed the findings of the market research conducted by Mr. Hackett.  less than br greater than  less than br greater than 7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION:  less than br greater than  less than br greater than It has been determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable and that approval of this recommendation is in the best interest of the government.  This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. less than br greater than

Vendor will provide all shipping, parts, operator's manuals, initial setup and calibration to NIST or ISO standards, onsite machine training, and cycle development and validation to specific laboratory rooms. Provide warranty for parts, maintenance and technical support for a period of one year from purchase date. less than br greater than Vendor will provide all necessary on-site training for each unit, along with calibration set-up and initial quality inspection of two (2) Victory units and tri-scale real-time monitoring module and, one (1) ARD with calibration of one (1) tri-scale real-time monitoring module and, 2000 gram desiccant pack and ensure units were shipped correctly and operational. A Technical Engineer will provide on-site cycle development for each machine to include all areas and projected areas where decontamination will be conducted. Technician will validate all cycles with real-time trials validated with biological indicators and chemical color change strips and provide data necessary to verify efficacy of decontamination to LSD. less than br greater than The requiring activity for this requirement is the West Desert Test Center's (WDTC) LSD. less than br greater than 4. Authority: (Identify the statutory authority, FAR title and FAR citation permitting other than full and open competition. It may be one of the following, but other exceptions may be used.) less than br greater than FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 10 USC 2304(c)(1). less than br greater than 5. Reasons for Authority Cited: less than br greater than FAR 6.302-1 or FAR 6.302-2 cited above] STERIS is the only contractor with a proprietary cycle that has single loop design that allows for constant humidity control throughout the cycle that is a patented technology the other competitors do not utilize. STERIS technology produces gaseous, non-condensing; vapor hydrogen peroxide concentrations via a programmed four phase cycle, other competitors cannot guarantee the steady concentration control. STERIS utilizes a desiccant to produce a 5% relative humidity air stream to generate maximum vapor hydrogen peroxide vapor concentrations. STERIS' low humidity operation is critical to maintain proper operation of the sensitive electronic equipment used inside the laboratories. High levels of humidity used by other vendors cause the 35% hydrogen peroxide to become condensed due to high levels of humidity used making the process very corrosive to circuit less than br greater than board and copper components. This becomes extremely important with high cost sensitive government equipment that needs to be routinely decontaminated from a hazardous environment. Any decontamination modality is harsh on sensitive equipment; however the dry technology afforded by the patented STERIS VHP is the least harsh due to the control of non-condensate of the peroxide keeping it in a vapor state and not condensing into concentrated levels of oxidizing peroxide on sensitive components or sensitive pieces of equipment. If the peroxide is allowed to condensate it corrodes or degradates materials rendering the equipment inoperable or nonfunctional and/or unsafe to use. To date, other competitors are not patented for the dry VHP technology. less than br greater than Steris uses an EPA registered sterilant, Vaprox, which is widely recognized and accepted in the environmental assessments and planning for future programs. less than br greater than STERIS' patented low humidity cycle provide the added capability to decontamination laboratory areas within a timely manner could gravely affect the overall mission of LSD. Without the ability to properly decontaminate laboratories to proved a safe working condition for technician, building mechanics, and preventative maintenance technician's machinery and laboratory safety equipment cannot be maintained and maintenance in accordance to manufacture requirements. This would result in thousands of dollars in delayed testing, purchasing on new equipment and possible exposure to deadly pathogens. less than br greater than In addition an established decontamination plan is required by the U.S. Army, Safety commissioning team and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the commissioning of new laboratory spaces. Without the added capacity to establish a decontamination plan new laboratory areas resulting in millions of dollars of construction will not be utilized until appropriate methods have been established. LSD currently lacks the technology to achieve this requirement. (DA Pam 385-69, Safety Standards for Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, Paragraph 10-2(d), pg 19. CDC BMBL 5th Edition, Appendix less than br greater than B, Decontamination of Large Spaces, pg. 331. less than br greater than 6. Actions to Increase Competition: Pursuant to FAR 5.202(a) (1), Contracting activity will continue to advocate brand name or equivalent specification for equipment purchased by WDTC LSD and personnel will continue to monitor and seek to identify other vendors that may meet LSD's specialized needs. less than br greater than 7. Market Research: Based on the explanation provided in paragraph 5 above, full-and-open competition is not feasible for this requirement. less than br greater than 8. Procurement History: less than br greater than Previous Purchase Order or Contract: No less than br greater than 9. Additional less than br greater than 11. Fair and Reasonable Price Determination: : As contracting officer, I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based upon comparable pricing charged to a different Government facility in May 2014. In accordance with 15.403-4, certified cost and pricing data is not required for this requirement since the estimated monetary value is below the $700,000 regulatory threshold. less than br greater than 13.

<DESC>This is a request to approve modification of Contract No: AID-617-C-13-00001 for implementation of the USAID/Uganda Feed the Future Agriculture Inputs Activity by increasing the total contract ceiling by $2,514,605 from $7,499,773 to $10,014,378. This action would permit Tetra Tech ARD to achieve scaling agricultural technology results in the remaining life of President Obama's Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative. This modification does not include any extension to the period of performance nor does it include substantial changes to the Scope of Work (SOW). The contract period of performance is from November 19, 2012 to November 19, 2017. <br /><br />The central objective of the cost plus fixed fee contract is to increase production of Uganda's priority FtF crops through the appropriate use of high quality agriculture inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and light equipment). This is to be achieved through increasing the availability of high quality inputs to farmers in FtF districts, decreasing the prevalence of counterfeit inputs, increasing awareness, benefits and proper usage of inputs, and improving domestic regulatory, and advocacy capacity for agriculture inputs. Adoption of new technology, such as improved inputs is critical for increasing incomes of rural households in Uganda. <br /><br />Using full and open competition for this modification would result in additionalcosts to the government as well as unacceptable delays. " As documented herein, this action is authorized by 40 U.S.C. 474 and AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) based on impairment of foreign programs specifically:" An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another&nbsp;would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable dealys."

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1. Contracting Activity:  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Amarillo Contracting Office, Network 
Contracting Activity 18, located at 7201 I-40 West, Suite 100, Amarillo TX 79106 proposes to enter into a firm-fixed price contract on the basis of justification for other than full and open competition (OTFOC) for the VA El Paso Healthcare System, Network Contracting Activity 18, located at 5001 N. Piedras Street, El Paso, Texas 79930.  The 2237# is 756-15-1-045-0001.

2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The VA El Paso Healthcare System is  
requesting the sole source purchase of maintenance, repair and software support for the Government -Owned Stellaris Phacoemulsification Unit by Bausch & Lomb, Inc. 30 Enterprise Suite 450, Aliso Viejo, CA 92656, phone number 636-226-3251.

3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet Agency's Needs:  Maintenance, Repair and  
Software Support for the government owned Stellaris Phacoemulsification Unit with (8) BL3170 Stellaris Ultrasound Hand pieces located in VA El Paso Healthcare System.  This equipment is considered mission critical and imperative to patient care.  The service renewal contract period of performance is required from October 1, 2014 - September 30, 2015 for the Base Year with potential of four additional Option Years (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016, 10/1/2016 - 9/30/2017, 10/1/2017 - 9/30/2018, 10/1/2018 - 9/30/2019).  The estimated value of this acquisition is $80,575. 

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  IAW FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One 
Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements:  per FAR 6.302-1.
      (X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will
		       Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )   (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )   (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.303-3;
	(  )   (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.304-4;
	(  )   (5) Authorized or Required by Statute per FAR 6.304-5;
	(  )   (6) National Security per FAR 6.304-6;
	(  )   (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.304-7;

5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires 
the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Bausch & Lomb, Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and has proprietary rights on all hardware, software, services and repairs for the Stellaris Phacoemulsification Unit currently used at the VA El Paso Healthcare System.  The original equipment was purchased under IFCAP PO 756-A0235 at the VA El Paso Healthcare System on September 26, 2007 for $107,000.  The delivery did not occur until September 2009, and included an extended warranty.  Additionally, a sole source letter on company letterhead, dated February 26, 2014, was received by this office from Bausch & Lomb representative, Gale Dias, and can found in the eCMS Briefcase, Tab P02.  

6.  Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as 
deemed practicable:  A search was made against current FSS contracts via the NAC Contract search tool, GSA Advantage, VETBIZ, and the internet which resulted in no potential sources being found other than the manufacturer - Bausch & Lomb, Inc.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair  
     and Reasonable:  The anticipated price to the Government is $16,115.00 (see chart below) for the 
     Base Year commencing in FY15 is as follows:

QUANTITY	PART NO.	DESCRIPTION	UNIT PRICE	EXT. PRICE
1	BL12110	Stellaris Anterior Deluxe System	$6,875.00	$6,875.00
	Dates:	10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015		
	Serial #:	SYS00160		
				
8	BL3170	Stellaris Ultrasound Hand Pieces	$1,155.00	$9,240.00
	Dates:	10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015		
	          Serial #:	USH15155, USH16380, USH04977, USH03467, USH19849, USH20991, USH17246, USH19773		
				
			Total:	$16,115.00

     Additionally, the Option Year's ICGE and contractor's pricing will be compared and further evaluated   
     to ensure that overall pricing is not imbalanced.
     
    *Previously, a Base plus Two Option year sole source contract, VA258-P-0611, was awarded for this
     location commencing on October 1, 2011.  The negotiated cost was $14,650 per year and remained 
     unchanged throughout the entire contract.  Furthermore, all things taken into consideration (i.e., 
     cost of living, lodging, gas, older government-owned equipment, etc.), an net increase of $1,465 per  
     year approximately three years later is determined as minimal.  Thus, the cost of the repair service for 
     the Stellaris Phacoemulsification Unit is considered to be fair and reasonable based upon previous     
     purchase order history of pricing or repair services of similar type items IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii).    

8.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition Market Research
Was Not Conducted:  Market research included FSS schedules and open market sources of available repair services; however, other repair services are unable to meet the government's requirements.  The Government's minimum requirement for schedule and technical capability for this service is satisfied only by Bausch & Lomb, Inc.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Delay in award could  
possibly cause additional problems if the VA loses power, or a computer bug infects the software - potentially leading to personal data lost and/or stolen.  

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  A Sources Sought   
      Notice was posted upon FBO website, dated February 26, 2014, and zero sources submitted   
      any such information in response.  

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to 
      Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The  
      proposed contract is a recurring type proprietary purchase/service.  This action currently allows the 
      VA El Paso Healthcare System to continue these services uninterrupted.  Due to above, the NCO is 
      unable, at this moment, to compete the requirement concerning future endeavors.  However, the 
      local acquisition team will necessitate its due diligence and continue to perform expanded market 
      research with the internet tools readily available to provide the latest changes, if any, for current 
      market conditions. 

12. Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bona fide     
need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance are  accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

13. Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304:  IAW 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other 
       supplies or services satisfy agency requirements, Authority granted by 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - the

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)
Simplified Acquisition Threshold ($3K to $150K)
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, 5115 NE 82nd Ave. Vancouver, WA 98662 for the Walla Walla VA Medical Center. 

2.	Nature of the Action Being Processed: This action is for a new firm fixed price contract with Fujifilm Medical Systems USA Inc. for scheduled maintenance on two Fujifilm CR Plate Readers. 

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
This procurement under PR# 687-15-1-048-0006 is for the maintenance support on two Fujifilm CR Plate Readers. Preventative maintenance includes support for parts and repairs, software updates, onsite service repairs, telephone support and one annual preventative maintenance for each plate reader. These plate readers are used to read and process digital X-ray image information that are recorded on an imaging plate which are then used to diagnose patient health issues. The period of performance for this action is 10/01/2014 - 09/30/2015 with three one year option periods. The estimated value of this action is $73,476 inclusive of option periods.  

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The specific reason for restricting competition is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This justification is where in accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Fujifilm Medical System manufactures these CR Plate Readers. Fujifilm is the only authorized contractor that can provide all the necessary support, parts, and system upgrades due to proprietary rights; also, their business model is structured around authorized dealers who can sell this equipment, and provide limited support, but only on the equipment that the authorized dealer sold. If an authorized dealer were to provide this service it would be a breach of their dealer agreement between authorized dealers and Fujifilm America. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:
Market research showed that the original equipment manufacturer is Fujifilm Medical. A sources sought notice was posted to GSA's eBUY from 07/09/2014 - 07/14/2014 and to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) from 07/09/2014 - 07/16/2014. Both sources sought notices asked for interested contractors to provide capability statements. No response was received from either sources sought notice. Fujifilm medical was contacted and they provided a memorandum stating that they do not have authorized dealers available to provide this maintenance service and that they are the only contractor capable of fulfilling this specific requirement due to proprietary nature of their equipment and software.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
The price is considered fair and reasonable based on a comparison of previous purchases for similar services. Previous contract VA668-C01720 was for maintenance on three similar Fujifilm image readers incidental with Dell equipment at the Spokane VA Medical Center with a period of performance 03/01/2010 - 02/28/2015. The previous contract cost averaged $11,880.00 per image reader per year for maintenance and was determined to be fair on reasonable. The proposed new contract value is $73,476.00 with a period of performance 10/01/2014 - 09/30/2018. The average price per image reader on the new contract is $11,088.00 for the base year and option year one, $7,830.00 per image reader in option year 2, and $6,732.00 per reader for option year three. 

Average price per image reader
 	Previous Contract	New contract	Percentage less than previous contract	Dollar value less than previous contract
Base Year	$11,800.00 	 $      11,088.00 	6.03%	 $                          712.00 
Option year one	$11,800.00 	 $      11,088.00 	6.03%	 $                          712.00 
Option year two	$11,800.00 	 $        7,830.00 	33.64%	 $                       3,970.00 
Option year three	$11,800.00 	 $        6,732.00 	42.95%	 $                       5,068.00 
Option year four	$11,800.00 	 N/A 	N/A 	N/A 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
As stated in section 6, sources sought notices were posted to GSA's eBUY and FBO to find capable sources of providing this service. No responses were received. The OEM, Fujifilm Medical was contacted and provided a memorandum stating there are no authorized subcontractors capable of providing service on their equipment. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
There are no other facts supporting the restriction of competition.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
Fujifilm Medical is the only source that expressed an interest in this acquisition. 	

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
There are no actions that are currently being taken to remove or overcome any barriers to competition. 















12.	Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 6.303-2(c) :
I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Restricting Competition


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, 8115 NE 82nd Ave. Vancouver, WA for the Boise VA Medical Center. 
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: for Acq Plan # VA260-14-AP-0934.
This procurement is for blood and blood products for the Boise VA Medical Center. In accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. The proposed action will be a new firm fixed price purchase order with estimated quantities. 

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
This procurement is for blood and blood supplies. The suggested vendor is the American Red Cross. They are currently providing blood products and performing blood tests for the Boise VA Medical Center. The estimated value of this procurement is $360,000.00 for the base year, and $1,800,000.00 for the entire base plus four option year periods. The type of blood and the amounts of blood will vary based on the number of patients that require blood and the type of blood and tests they require. This will be an estimated quantities purchase order based on past usage. The period of performance will be from 10/01/2014 - 09/30/2015 with four (4) one year option periods. The different types of blood that are expected to be needed are Red Blood Cells - Leukoreduced, Platelets - pheresis units, and fresh frozen plasma. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The authority for applying the Commercial Test Program of  FAR 13.5 is (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
The American Red Cross is the only contractor capable of delivering blood to the Boise VAMC. There are no other established blood banks close enough to the Boise VAMC campus to fulfill this requirement. 

The contractor delivers volunteer donor blood only and in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules and regulations. They have an identifying numbering schematic approved by the FDA. The FDA also has stringent collection, certifications, licensing, monitoring, storage, and shelf life requirements. The American Red Cross has been able to maintain all of these certifications and licensing as well as follow all other FDA rules regarding the collection and delivery of blood.

   

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:
Blood supply is an oligopoly, only a limited number of businesses are able to provide blood supply. An FDA webinar, "The Safety of Blood Supplies" on 02/15/2011 states that 90% of blood products in the United States come from the American Red Cross or America's Blood Centers. America's Blood Centers are made up of a network of independent not-for-profit community blood centers across the United States. It is further stated on an American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) joint statement before the blood products advisory committee, "maintaining a safe and adequate supply of donated blood during a severe emergency" that the ARC supplies over 40% of blood to the United States and American Blood Centers supply over half of blood to the United States. AABB is a not-for-profit association that assists with developing blood standards and is an accreditation organization for educational programs relating to relating to blood, transfusion, and cellular therapies. A search on America's Blood Center's website shows that they currently do not have a blood center in Boise; there is only an American Red Cross. The only other blood center in the State of Idaho is Inland Northwest Blood Center, part of America's Blood Centers, and only has blood banks in Coeur d'Alene and Lewiston Idaho which are between 271 and 383 miles away from Boise, too far to meet the delivery timeframe of this requirement. Previous purchase orders VA260-14-P-3745 and VA260-13-J-2649 were for the same requirement and was also sole sourced to the American Red Cross branch in Boise Idaho; also, BPA VA260-BP-0068 was awarded 09/23/2008 and were also sole sourced to the American Red Cross in Boise Idaho; therefore, it is determined that there are no capable contractors besides the American Red Cross to fulfill this requirement, so no other sources were solicited. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
The anticipated price of blood for this proposed purchase order is considered fair and reasonable. A blood research study from the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health shows that the average price for a unit of blood in 2011 was $343.63. The anticipated average price for a unit of blood under this proposed purchase order is $291.00. This is derived from the mean price of each of the regularly anticipated three units of blood that will be needed. Red blood cells - Leukoreduced, $235.00 each, Platelets, $567.00 each, Fresh Frozen Plasma, $71.00 each. These individual units of blood prices are the estimated cost to the Boise VA Medical Center based on prices paid under previous purchase order VA260-14-P-3745 with a period of performance 10/01/2013 - 09/30/2014. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
As stated in section 6, based on an FDA webinar, and an AABB statement, market research shows that the supply of blood to hospitals is an oligopoly and generally only available from two sources. The American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers are the two main providers of blood in the United States. A search on America's Blood Center's website showed that they do not have a blood bank in Boise Idaho; therefore, The American Red Cross is the only contractor that can fulfill this blood requirement for the Boise VAMC. Market research also revealed this is a commercial item (See P02 Market Research in the eCMS action briefcase). 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
No other sources in the Boise area expressed an interest in providing blood and blood products to the Boise VAMC. 
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
No other sources in the Boise area expressed an interest in providing this requirement. 

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
There is no action the agency is taking to remove or overcome any barriers for competition of blood in the Boise area at this time. If at least one other blood donation and distribution center is setup in Boise, or close to Boise, a competitive solicitation will be posted to FBO for competition between the two businesses. 







































12.	Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 13.501:
I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Restricting Competition


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, 8115 NE 82nd Ave. Vancouver, WA for the Spokane VA Medical Center (SVAMC).   
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: for PR # 668-14-3-038-0007. This procurement is for blood and blood products for the Spokane VA Medical Center. In accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. The proposed action will be a new Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. 

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
This procurement is for blood and blood supplies. The suggested vendor is Inland Northwest Blood Center (INBC). They are currently providing blood products and performing blood tests for the Spokane VA Medical Center. The estimated value of this procurement is $330,000.00 for the base year, and $1,650,000.00 for the entire base plus four option year periods. The type of blood and the amounts of blood will vary based on the number of patients that require blood and the type of blood and tests they require. The period of performance will be from 07/01/2014 - 06/30/2015 with four (4) one year option periods. The regularly needed, however inconclusive, different types of blood and testing that are expected to be needed are various Red Blood Cells (RBC), Cyro, Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), Plateletpheresis, Crossmatch (Electronic and full), ABO and Rh type, Antibody Screen, Direct and Indirect Antiglobulin test, Antibody Identification, and Transfusion Reaction Investigation. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The authority for applying the Commercial Test Program of  FAR 13.5 is (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
INBC is the only contractor certified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) capable of supplying blood to the Spokane VAMC. There are no other established blood banks close enough to the Spokane VAMC campus to fulfill this requirement. The contractor delivers volunteer donor blood only and in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules and regulations. They have an identifying numbering schematic approved by the FDA. The FDA also has stringent collection, certifications, licensing, monitoring, storage, and shelf life requirements. INBC has been able to maintain all of these certifications and licensing as well as follow all other FDA rules regarding the collection and delivery of blood. 




6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:

An FDA webinar, "The Safety of Blood Supplies" on 02/15/2011 states that 90% of blood products in the United States come from the American Red Cross or America's Blood Centers. America's Blood Centers are made up of a network of independent not-for-profit community blood centers across the United States.

AABB is a not-for-profit association that assists with developing blood standards and is an accreditation organization for educational programs relating to relating to blood, transfusion, and cellular therapies. A search on the American Red Cross's website on April 2nd, 2014 shows that they currently do not have a blood center in Spokane and cannot service the Spokane VAMC; there is only INBC, which is part of America's Blood Centers. Previous contracts VA260-13-P-1519 and VA668-C11648 were for the same requirement and were also sole sourced to INBC; therefore, it is determined that there are no capable contractors besides INBC that can fulfill this requirement, so no other sources were solicited. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
The anticipated price of blood for this proposed contract is considered fair and reasonable. A blood research study from the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health showed that the average price for a unit of blood in 2011 was $343.63. The anticipated average price for a unit of blood under this proposed contract is $157.67. This is derived from the mean price of each regularly anticipated unit of blood that will be needed. These individual units of blood prices are the estimated cost to the Spokane VA Medical Center based on prices paid under contract VA260-13-P-1519 with a period of performance 07/01/2013 - 06/30/2014; also, previous contract VA668-C11648 had an option year period of performance from 07/01/2012 - 06/30/2013. The value of that option year was $304,566.00. The option year price on the previous contract was determined to be fair and reasonable based on a comparison with the Independent Government Cost Estimate. The new proposed contract, valued at $330,000.00, is for the same price for each unit of blood. The only reason for the price increase is because the quantity of each of the units required has increased.   

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
As stated in section 6, based on an FDA webinar, and an AABB statement, market research shows that the supply of blood to hospitals is an oligopoly and generally only available from two sources. The American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers are the two main providers of blood in the United States. A search on the American Red Cross's website on April 2nd, 2014 showed that they do not serve the Spokane area. A search on America's Blood Center's website showed they have two blood banks within 30 miles of Spokane, both of which are INBC blood banks; therefore, INBC, part of America's Blood Centers, is the only contractor that can fulfill this blood requirement for the Spokane VAMC. Market research also revealed this is a commercial item (See P02 Market Research in the eCMS action briefcase). 



9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
There are no other facts supporting the restriction of competition.    

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Restricting Competition


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 20, for the American Lake VA Medical Center in the Puget Sound Healthcare System (PSHCS). 
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: for PR # 663-15-1-501-0012.  This procurement is for fire suppression and emergency services at the American Lake VA Medical Center. In accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
This procurement is for fire suppression and fire department emergency response services for the American Lake VA Medical Center. The proposed contract period of performance is 10/01/2014 - 09/30/2015 with one (1) one year option period. The total base year value is $213,539.00 and a total contract value of $433,484.00.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The authority for applying the Commercial Test Program of  FAR 13.5 is (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Pierce County Fire District #3 (West Pierce Fire & Rescue) is the only contractor that can provide fire suppression and emergency services for the American Lake VA Medical Center. The emergency services needed require that a contractor respond to emergency calls and be onsite at the American Lake VA Medical Center with a four person firefighting crew within eight minutes after notification. This eight minute response time is needed to safeguard human life and property, control and suppress fires at the American Lake VA Medical Center, and lend any other emergency response assistance needed. There are two fire stations that are close enough to the American Lake VA Medical Center to meet this eight minute response time frame. Both fire stations were contacted; because of the lack of resources described in section 6 that the fire station on Joint Base Lewis-McChord has, they were not capable of fulfilling this requirement leaving only the West Pierce Fire & Rescue fire department to provide the emergency services needed. 

  






6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:
As one of the requirements of this work is for a contractor to be able to be onsite within eight minutes of notification of an emergency, a Google maps search was conducted and found six fire stations within a 10 miles radius of the American Lake VA Medical Center. Five of these stations all belonged to Pierce County Fire District #3. The sixth station was on Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM). A phone conversation and a follow up email with their Deputy Fire Chief and their Central Command resulted in a determination that they did not have the necessary resources available to provide this service, nor did they have a route that could be taken to ensure they could respond in a timely manner as each of JBLM's gates has restricted exit and entry access and no direct route to the American Lake VA Medical Center. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
The price is considered fair and reasonable based on a comparison of previous contract VA260-P-0584 which provided this service to the American Lake VA Medical Center. The previous contract in place had a modification awarded in the amount of $103,659.48 for the period of 10/01/2013 - 03/31/2014 which was determined to be fair and reasonable based on Washington State mandate that all entities within a prescribed fire district pay a levy for fire suppression services. The Washington state levy amount must be voter approved by the people living within the fire district. The proposed new contract for this same service is estimated at $213,539.00 for the base year and $219,945.00 for the one option year. When compared to the previous contract, the proposed new contract only increases 3% per year; also, in the August 6th, 2013 election, a property tax levy, proposition 1, resulted in Pierce County Fire Protection District #3 adopting resolution number 050113-004 which authorized the district to levy a property tax on all taxable property within the District of approximately $1.60 per $1,000.00 of value. The amount that will be charged to the VA will be applied against this levy rate. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
Market research showed that this requirement is available in the commercial market place. All required sources were checked, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and small businesses were considered; however, market research determined that this requirement is not available from a required source, and there are no SDVOSB's, VOSB's, or small businesses available to fulfill this requirement for the American Lake VA Medical Center. Market research determined that Pierce County Fire District #3 is the only available source that can fulfill this requirement.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
No other sources expressed an interest in providing the service for this requirement, nor did any contractor besides Pierce County Fire District express interest in this requirement when the current contract in place was awarded 10/01/2009.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
No sources expressed any interest in writing for this requirement. 






11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
There is currently no action the VA is taking to overcome any barriers for competition for fire suppression and emergency services provided to the American Lake VA Medical Center. If the Pierce County Fire Districts boundaries change where there are more than one district that has a fire station capable of fulfilling the eight minute response time, this requirement could be competed among those Fire Districts; furthermore, the last email sent to JBLM stated to the effect that if they had any interest in working with the VA on this requirement in the future, they should contact the Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20 to discuss an inter-agency agreement. Option years are preferred for this requirement as there are no other sources capable of fulfilling this requirement, and there are no known events that will take place that could result in more than one source capable of fulfilling this requirement. 





































12.	Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 13.501:
I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION
ORDER >$3,000
FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
2237 Transaction # or Vista Equipment Transaction #: 655-15-1-1359-0001		  

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: OLYPMUS AMERICA INC. Contract #V797P-2065D	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Lyn Wall 248-545-4275	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 3500 CORPATE PARKWAY, CENTER VALLEY, PA 18034-0610	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: MAUREEN ALLEN 989-239-3589	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	Saginaw VA Medical Center 
		
                                                                          VISN:	11	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
36 month lease, base plus two option year lease for Olympus Endoscopes and related equipment.  

(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE   AGENCY'S NEED:
Lease of Olympus Evis Exera III Endoscopes, Eletosurgical Generators, Workstations, Monitors  and related equipement for the Saginaw VAMC,  base year 10/1/2014 to 9/30/2015 with two (2) option years.	

       (b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $225,960.85  contract total, 

       (c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   10/1/2014	









(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.  

The goal of the VISN 11 Endoscopy Subcommittee is to standardize all scopes within a medical center,  to compy with the VHA Endoscope IPT Guidance (11/16/2010),  Standardization of Endoscopy Equipment reduces errors,  improves patient safety and reduces set up and reprocessing of medical equipment.  The Saginaw VAMC currently uses Olympus endoscopes, gastroscopes, cystoscopes and related Olympus Equipment.  

Staff, both nurses and doctors are currently trained and validated on Olympus Equipment that is in use throught VISN 11 and the Saginaw VAMC, Endoscopes, Cystoscopes, and Gastroscopes, purchasing another brand would result in additional training and possibly compromise patient care.

Olympus Endoscope Equipment is only available from one source on FSS, V797P-2065D, Olympus America.  


0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 





 (5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
$227,586.05  This price is fair and reasonable based on contract pricing for the NAC contract, V797P-2065D.   This pricing is also similar to other Olympus Endoscope scopes leases within VISN 11, VA251-P-1107.   By procuring new Olympus scopes the trade in value for the existing  Olympus scopes is $32,000.

 (6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
GSA Schedule 65II A, A-9 Medical scopes were searched, there are two other vendors who offer scopes on FSS Schedules, Pentax, V797D-30172, Karl Storz V797D-30255, Olympus is the only vendor that offers endoscope leases which are preferable due to the heavy use this equipment incurs during patient care at the Endoscopy clincs within VISN 11.	


(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None	
	

 (8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Should another requisition of this nature reoccur ,we would undertake a new market survey.
