This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/>Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing the XM153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS), recapitalization of the previously delivered XM153 CROWS, engineering and logistics services, and spares parts. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The Government has determined that a Full and Open Competition Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract will be utilized for the CROWS requirement.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract(s) under three (3) separate and distinct areas of its Statement of Work (SOW).  Each area will have a different contract type associated with it.  The three (3) areas of the SOW and the three (3) planned contract types associated with each one for this requirement are as follows:<br/><br/>I. Fixed-Price, IDIQ: To support production of a maximum of 18,000 CROWS, field maintenance support, and spares.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 300 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 500 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Fixed-Price Incentive, IDIQ:  To support product improvements, integrations, and testing.  Share line will be 50/50 with 120 percent ceiling as a point of departure. <br/><br/>III. Firm-Fixed-Price Level-of-Effort, IDIQ:  To support training, overhaul, depot-level maintenance and recapitalization of CROWS; and for general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification will consist of performance requirements and will specify technical drawings.  The detail specification will specify the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and/or how the items are to be fabricated or constructed.  Some sub-assemblies will not include technical drawings and assembly procedures.  Instead, data for those sub-assemblies will include directed source(s) or build-to-spec requirements or both. This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between multiple CROWS producers and commonality/interchangeability with the existing CROWS fleet.  The Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation but will not be included in the draft solicitation release:<br/><br/>Detail Specification<br/>   -     Performance requirements<br/>   -     Technical Drawings<br/>   -     Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/>   -     Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/>   -     Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/>   -     Assembly procedures<br/>   -     List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/>   -     Quality requirements <br/>   -     Test requirements<br/>   -     Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be provided at any time nor will Contractors have access to the data. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the US Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be handled utilizing a software change process between the US Government and Contractor(s). <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be available after Request for Proposal release upon request provided that all necessary paper work is properly completed by the requester, submitted, and approved prior to any release.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit a DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, and Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided. The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (Other Foreign) must complete and submit a AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire and a Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided and also be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced.  <br/><br/>This announcement serves as notification that export control procedures regulated by the ITAR are in effect on the above stated data. Contractors that are interested in receiving this data must be in compliance with the ITAR and possess the proper authorities to receive this data and are encouraged to do so as soon as possible.  The data will be marked Distribution Statement  B  Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies only.   All other requests for this data shall be referred to Project Manager Soldier Weapons.  Foreign vendors and contractors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for Contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR.  Contractors may consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and may consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions they may have relating to compliance with the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).  Please reference the following link consulting these regulations http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers. The GFM may include full up XM153 CROWS systems, select parts and weapons. Contractors must make the appropriate accommodations to be approved for handling and storage of weapons. Government support may be provided to assist in understanding the setup and use of the XM153 CROWS and its operation following contract award. <br/><br/>The present schedule projects a release of a draft solicitation on or about 3QFY11.  An Industry Day will be announced during the draft solicitation release and further details shall be posted on FedBizOpps.gov (https://www.fbo.gov/). All responses to this notice shall be in writing in the English language and be at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. The POC for this action can be contacted at Department of the Army, Army Contracting Command - Picatinny.

<DESC>Item Description: NSN 1005-01-562-7393- Cleaning Kit, Gun, bought in accordance with Otis Products (01VS3) part number 211-IWCK. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in it's solicitation for this item. The required quantity is 1750 units to be shipped to (W25G1U) DLA Distribution DDSP New Cumberland Facility, New Cumberland, PA 17070-5002. FOB destination and inspection at destination is required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 05/15/13. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and Ability One. The required delivery is 60 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for the processing of experimental NiTiHf and NiTiZr shape memory alloys developed by our Center. The alloy requires unusually strict compositional control (an order of magnitude greater than typical commercial alloys) and is also high in Ti and Hf/Zr (very reactive elements) and thus extremely difficult to process. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Flowserve Corporation, 2200 East Monument Avenue, Dayton Ohio  45402. In previous requirements and in collaborative effort with Boeing, this vendor has demonstrated their capability to deliver heats of identical material which is critical to our continued needs for in-house adaptive structures development.  It is our intent to duplicate and fine tune these previous efforts by ordering additional heats of material. The Government intends to acquire these additional heats using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. The Sole Source is under the authority of FAR reference 13.106-1(b)1. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on MAY 9, 2013 . Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive RM 1E142, Rockville, MD 20892.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Office of the Director (OD) plans to procure on a sole source basis with REES Scientific Corporation, 1007 Whitehead Road Ext., Trenton, NJ 08638, to modernize, upgrade, and consolidate many of the components of the existing Rees scientific alarm system to a modern, wireless system.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 334519 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for six (6) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The NCI is in need of purchasing, installing, and fully validating an expansion of the existing scientific alarm system (SAS) currently located on the Bethesda campus in Buildings 10, 41, and 37. The purchase will consist of adding a new node in Bldg. 37 and other Rees components to make the expansion functional. The new system must include features such as the "Buddy Watch" alarm function which will connect to the existing system as well as the ability to add V2-2.4GHz wireless transmitters that buffer data every 5 minutes with 7 days of memory.</p>
<p>For approximately 20 years, NCI has been successfully using the Rees Scientific Monitoring system to support -80C freezers, CO2 incubators, -20C freezers, and +4C cold rooms. These pieces of scientific equipment house and store biological samples that are used in biomedical cancer research, many of which are irreplaceable. The backbone of this SAS is in place and has been invested in over the years. It would be prohibitively expensive to replace this system wholesale, as it is already installed and functioning. The current existing hardware/software systems and the performance record that NCI has had with Rees over the years make Rees Scientific Corporation the only viable source to meet the NCI's needs.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for the delivery of a fully functional Enterprise node alarm system. The contractor shall deliver a physical Enterprise Node system and associated hardware. This includes the Enterprise node, several V2 Nets (wireless communication devices placed next to scientific equipment), and approximately 15 alarm points. These are thermistor type probes and are physical installed within -80C freezers and other scientific equipment for temperature monitoring. Once all installation work is completed, the contractor shall deliver the operations manual and validation paperwork that confirms all probes are installed and functioning, all V2 Nets are installed and functioning properly, and the Node itself is functioning properly. A short training session for operations staff shall also be delivered.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor, REES Scientific Corporation, is the proprietary holder of the existing alarm systems and to the knowledge of the NCI has no resellers. Thus, Rees Scientific Corporation is the only known source to obtain the required upgrade.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on May 13, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240)276-5401 or emailed to Afua Serwah- Asibey, Contract Specialist at afua.serwah-asibey@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), through sam.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number N02PC32507-59 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to make an award to The Population Association of America (PAA), 8630 Fenton Street, Suite 722, Silver Spring, MD 20910 to perform analyses for the National Children Study (NCS) Program Office on a number of Primary Sampling Units (PSU's) required to achieve a sufficiently diverse sample of participants, in terms of demographic characteristics and geographic exposures.
<p>The sole source determination is based on that the PAA is a scientific, professional organization established to promote the improvement, advancement and progress of the human race through research of problems related to human population. The Association members are the foremost authorities on probabilistic samples, demographics, economics and surveys of the U.S. population. The scope and proposed design of the NCS require functional knowledge of each of these areas. The expertise that can be accessed through this single source saves the government time and money when compared to acquisitions by other mechanisms such as assembling teams of scientists individually from other organizations. It is likely that an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This solicitation is not a Small Business Set-Aside. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however; all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. It is anticipated that the RFQ NIH-NICHD-13-036 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis. Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ. All interested parties to this solicitation may request a copy of the RFQ package in writing to the attention of Ms. Patricia Haun at National Institute Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 5Z00, Rockville, MD 20815 or via email Haunp@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) <br>  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation;  <br> (b) Although  quote mark proposal quote mark  and  quote mark offeror quote mark  are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal;  <br> (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of conducting a market survey for an affordable Proximity Sensor capable of initiating a Height of Burst (HOB) warhead detonation in accordance with the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munition (FOM) engagements. <br>  <br> Pursuant to FAR 15.2, this notice is being issued as a Research and Development Information Sought.  Contract POC: Ms. Tammy Benson, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, CCAM-RDB, Redstone Arsenal, AL. <br>  <br> This is a pre-solicitation REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), AMRDEC, Redstone Arsenal, AL, desires to obtain information on an affordable Proximity Sensor capable of initiating a Height of Burst (HOB) warhead detonation in accordance with Precision Fires, Rockets, and Missile System (PFRMS) type engagements.  The proximity sensor should be capable of integrating with the current Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) with little or no modification to current assets.  Leeway is allowed for antenna integration into the airframe as well as an interface board to manage communications from the proximity electronics to the system guidance section and Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF).   <br> Innovative concepts for integrating the proximity sensor at any location on the body except for the nose tip or motor are welcome.  AMRDEC is interested in receiving information on affordable concepts that can be quickly integrated, tested, and fielded.  The developmental path should support hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testing prior to 2QFY14 and flight testing in a surrogate GMLRS (using current GMLRS ESAF) no later than 3QFY14. The goal of the program is to produce a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 reduced cost proximity sensor that adds capability to the current system (TRL definition is provided in Annex 1).  Our interest lies in a proximity sensor (to include all hardware and software) with an Average Unit Production Cost (AUPC) of less than $3,000 (FY14 dollars) based on a quantity of 1,600 per year.  The sensor must measure height above ground (shortest path from the rocket to a defined reflective surface) from 1 to 40m.  At minimum, discrete heights of 1, 3, 7, 10, 15 and 30 meters shall be selectable. Information and cost element definition is provided in Annex 2.   <br>  <br> The focus of this RFI is on receipt of information for affordable proximity sensor concepts which are capable of being quickly integrated into a GMLRS/ATACMS munition.  As a baseline, the sensor must be able to meet or exceed the following requirements: <br> 1. The Proximity Sensor shall be capable of HOB detection from 1 to 40m - at minimum, discrete detection of 1, 3, 7, 10, 15 and 30m must be selectable. <br> 2. The Proximity Sensor shall be capable of HOB indication with an accuracy of +/- 10%  <br> 3. The Proximity Sensor will not broadcast a HOB detection indication and should fully recover immediately upon removal of an interfering signal <br> 4. The Proximity Sensor shall be capable of operating at velocities from 250 m/s to 850 m/s at angles from -30 to -110 degrees (where -90 degrees is rocket vertical nose down) <br> 5.  The Proximity Sensor shall be capable of operation after GMLRS transportation conditions and during GMLRS flight conditions.  Loading, thermal, and vibration requirements for transportation and flight are provided in Annexes 3 and 4, respectively. <br> 6. The Proximity Sensor shall be capable of detecting heights based on an extended surface having a RADAR reflectivity coefficient between 0.2 and 0.8 <br> 7. The Proximity Sensor shall be capable of being powered off and on during flight and shall start sensing/ranging no later than 250 milliseconds after the sensor has been enabled  <br> 8. The Proximity Sensor (to include all hardware) shall be less than 0.5kg in weight and be fully contained within the physical limits of the GMLRS airframe - actual volume restrictions are dependent on placement location and will be provided upon request <br> 9. The Proximity Sensor shall not be placed on the nose tip or motor section of either munition <br> 10. The Proximity Sensor that is functional in the GMLRS airframe must also be functional in sizes up to the ATACMS airframe with minimal modification (ie antenna resizing) <br>  <br> Submissions will only be reviewed if they meet the HOB detection, accuracy, and operational requirements.  Submissions shall address each of the listed requirements and provide information on how each requirement is met or exceeded.  Each submission must also define a path for scaling the sensor package for integration from the requested GMLRS size up to an ATACMS size munition. <br>  <br> A key focus of this effort is to deliver an affordable proximity sensor as a means of a cost reduction initiative within PFRMS.  Our interest lies in a proximity sensor (to include all hardware and software) with a unit production cost not to exceed $3,000 (FY14 dollars) with a desired production cost of $2,000.  A missile procurement rate of 1,600 per year may be assumed.   <br>  <br> The proximity sensor shall be able to integrate on the current GMLRS and ATACMS missile systems.  At minimum, the sensor shall be capable of interfacing with the current GMLRS ESAF - it must accept regulated power from the ESAF and provide an open collector fire command output.  The range response output signal shall be via a two-wire interface to the ESAF.  An additional 422 asynchronous connection to the GMLRS Guidance Section for HOB selection and sensor status is desired along with a SDLC 422 line for future capability. <br>  <br> Respondents may present multiple candidate solutions to this requirement.  In the response, candidates should address how the system will detect and function within the specified altitude to target heights, meet the cost target, and discuss any tradeoffs in performance required to meet these cost targets.  The assessment criteria used to evaluate the information received in response to this RFI will be (1) expected performance capabilities and limitations; (2) technology maturity and schedule risk of the integrated concept and system elements; (3) system capability to integrate onto both GMLRS and ATACMS systems; (4) schedule; (5) cost (development, integration and procurement); and (6) system complexity. <br>  <br> The objective of this process is to provide the Government sufficiently detailed information to better understand current and viable future prototype products and technologies within the United States Government and industrial base which are capable of achieving the requirements defined above.  White papers that fail to comply with the above instructions, or present ideas not pertinent to subject, may not be reviewed.  The Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request presentations to enhance our understanding of the respondent's submittal.  After completion of government independent assessment, respondents will be provided a concise summary of assessment results.  Material from respondent submittals, with the exception of identified proprietary information, may be incorporated into future solicitations.  Multiple concepts may be submitted.  NO FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IS ALLOWED.  U.S. CITIZENS ONLY.  A complete response to this RFI shall consist of a whitepaper and briefing described below. Respondents shall provide a separate, complete, stand-alone package consisting of these items for each concept submitted. In describing the proximity sensor, respondents shall address each of the requirements listed, describe both the electronic/processing package as well as the antenna package, and discuss how the concept could be scaled from a GMLRS munition to an ATACMS munition.   Cost information may be submitted in contractor format. The proposed concept shall identify key components and the associated cost.  Concepts shall identify their pedigree and describe any company expertise, previous fielding or other uses.  Candidate systems that have successfully demonstrated in a similar application or those that will be able to demonstrate, to a minimum, TRL7 by 3QFY14 are desired. For any candidate system not yet demonstrated in a similar application, the response shall identify ongoing efforts that will further mature the system.  <br>  <br> ** ATTENTION:  AMRDEC plans to use a non-Government support contractor in assessing industry responses resulting from this RFI.  Thus, if responses include proprietary information, it must be marked accordingly.  Each respondent must be willing to sign non-disclosure agreements with the non-Government support contractor so AMRDEC can properly protect the proprietary information submitted. The following non-Government support contractor will be used during this assessment: <br>  <br> 	NTA Inc. <br> 	2001 Nichols Dr. Suite 101 <br> 	Huntsville, AL 35802 <br> 	Attention: Charles Osborn <br> 	Phone: 256.313.1732 <br> 	Email: Charles.t.osborn@us.army.mil <br>  <br>  In accomplishing their duties relating to the review process, the above mentioned firm may require access to proprietary information contained in the offerors' responses.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 112990 - All Other Animal Production; Small Business Size Standard is $0.75M.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Jefferson, AR requirement for Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Toxicants in Non-Human Primates, NHP (Rhesus Macaques of Indian Origin).</p>
<p>As part of these analyses, the NCTR has the need to conduct the following experiments described in the below "DRAFT" Statement of Objectives (SOO):</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>Animal requirements:<br />The contractor shall supply sixteen (16) nulliparous or sixteen (16) primiparous female Rhesus macaques monkeys of Indian origin. The animals shall be drug na&iuml;ve (with the exception of anesthesia), between the ages of 3 and 5 years old, weigh between 6.0 and 7.5 kg, and demonstrate fertility by evidence of continued estrous cycles for at least six (6) months. The animals shall be conditioned prior to the initiation of the study such that dosing and blood collection may be accomplished without the use of anesthesia.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements above, the following health requirements for the test subjects shall be met:<br />(1) All monkeys shall test negative for the following pathogens within one-to-two months prior to the initiation of the study: (1) Tuberculosis; (2) Cercopithecine herpes virus 1 (B virus); (3) SRV/D (Simian Retrovirus type D); (4) SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus); (5) STLV-1 (Simian T-Lymphotropic Virus-1). <br />(2) All monkeys shall either (1) have been vaccinated against measles as a juvenile or (2) be vaccinated against measles within one-to-two months prior to the initiation of the study.<br />(3) All monkeys shall be examined by a licensed Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM), experienced in NHP medicine and surgery, and found to be in good health within one month prior to the initiation of the study.<br />(4) Health records and documentation of testing/treatment for all monkeys shall be provided to the NCTR Attending DVM before the initiation of the study.<br />(5) Monkeys shall be tested for Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and helminth &amp; pathogenic protozoal parasites within one month prior to the initiation of the study. Treatment regimens for any monkeys testing positive for these organisms shall be discussed with the Principal Investigator (PI) before initiation of treatment.</p>
<p>Animal facilities:<br />The animals shall be maintained in a US-based facility that is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). Further, the contractor shall supply the NCTR Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) with a copy of the contractor's internal IACUC approved protocol with signatures.</p>
<p>Test Article: <br />The test article will be purchased by NCTR as will the vehicle for both the oral and Intravenous (IV) dosing. The test article and the vehicles will be provided to the test facility for use in the study. Using an NCTR-provided procedure, the test article shall be dispersed in the appropriate vehicles at the specified concentrations at the test facility. An aliquot of each dosing solution shall then be shipped to NCTR for dose certification prior to its use. The test facility shall be located in the continental US such that the dose solution samples can be shipped overnight to NCTR by courier within 72 hours of preparation at the test facility. The dose solution samples shall be shipped only after arrangements have been made with the NCTR PI.</p>

<CONTACT>Adam D. Hiland, Email HilandAD@state.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: ON-SITE SPECIMEN COLLECTION OF DOS DIPLOMATIC SECURITY (DS) EMPLOYEES
<p>1.0 PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Department of State (DoS) Office of Diplomatic Security (DS) is concerned with the well-being of its employees, the successful accomplishment of agency missions, and the need to maintain employee productivity. Many of the DS-hired U.S. Citizen (USC) and Third Country National (TCN) direct hire and/or contract positions in Afghanistan and Jerusalem involve the use of weapons and access to highly sensitive information that must not be compromised. It is critically important that such armed employees, or those employees exposed to extreme conditions, be reliable, stable, and show good use of judgment. Illegal drug and steroid use creates the possibility of coercion, influence, and irresponsible action under pressure, all of which may pose a serious risk to national defense, public safety, and security. Prior to deployment, all employees certify that drug testing and steroid screening is a nonnegotiable condition of employment.</p>
<p>This performance work statement defines the drug and steroid testing requirements (hereinafter referred to as "Substance Screening") applicable to DS-hired USC and TCN direct hires and/or contract positions in Afghanistan and Jerusalem. In this document, DS will be referred to as the DS who will receive support from the Contractor. Employee will be the all-encompassing term for DS direct hires, personal services contractors, or third party contractors. A list of additional definitions is provided at the end of this RFI.</p>
<p>2.0 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be licensed to operate through the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and Government of Israel, and shall be in full compliance with host country business requirements. The Contractor will be self-sufficient and required to provide all life support, travel and security needs for staff. In addition, the Contractor shall support all shipping, maintenance, and housing of equipment necessary to perform services. The Contractor will provide all resources to perform random and non-random Substance Screening, preferably at the following locations, with the corresponding number of estimated employees:</p>
<p>&bull; Kabul: 1300<br />&bull; Mazar e-Sharif: 150<br />&bull; Herat: 175<br />&bull; Jerusalem: 55</p>
<p>Random screening will be on a semiannual basis (every six months) as well as non-random substance testing. All random and non-random substance testing performed shall comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules (http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/index.html). See Sections 4.1- Random Drug Testing and Steroid Screening and 4.2- Non-Random (Post Incident, Reasonable Suspicion, Follow-up, etc.). As coordinated with DS, the Contractor will preferably utilize its in-country clinics for Substance Screening. The clinic shall meet the standards outlined in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Laboratory Certification Program. Please refer to the following SAMHSA link for further information: http://www.workplace.samhsa.gov/DrugTesting/pdf/Natl_Lab_Cert_Prog_Background1007.pdf</p>
<p>3.0 PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Contractor's in-country medical staff shall be capable of attaining a Moderate Risk Public Trust (MRPT) security certification processed by DOS within 60 days prior to contract award. Not more than three certified test personnel, with one also serving as a site lead, are anticipated to be necessary and available 24 hours per day, seven days per week at each of the four locations (Jerusalem, Kabul, Mazar e-Sharif and Herat).</p>
<p>Refer to the following information for an MRPT to be processed: http://www.opm.gov/investigations/background-investigations/federal-investigations-notices/2010/aligning_opm_investigative_levels.pdf</p>
<p>All staff shall be fully certified and trained to US standards, in accordance to HHS Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, on the procedures for obtaining a urine specimen, conducting and reading a rapid test for substances and, when necessary, establishing proper chain of custody procedures when transporting urine specimens to a lab for analysis. All staff must pass an examination administered by a Health and Human Services-approved organization. Please refer to the following link for medical review officer resources that will be relied upon for guidelines: http://www.workplace.samhsa.gov/Dtesting.html</p>
<p>Employees must maintain an unbiased and fair approach while conducting business, and should not be affiliated with and/or hold financial interest(s) in any private security contractors currently contracting with (or seeking to contract with) DS.</p>
<p>4.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be prepared to test for the following drugs utilizing a rapid urine test in Afghanistan and/or Israel, except for Steroid:</p>
<p>&bull; Amphetamine<br />&bull; Opiate<br />&bull; Benzodiazepine <br />&bull; Barbituates <br />&bull; Cocaine <br />&bull; Marijuana<br />&bull; Steroid: Refer to the following commonly abused steroids on the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NISA) website or at Steroidabuse.gov.</p>
<p>4.1 COLLECTION OF SPECIMENS<br />Requirements for specimen collection vary according to the purpose for which the results will be used. However, to meet evidentiary requirements the service provider must ensure the specimen collection site be secure in order to eliminate the possibility of specimen tampering or adulteration and to ensure the security of the collected specimens.</p>
<p>The validity of urine drug screen results is dependent on specimen integrity. The service provider shall provide direct-observation collections to provide specimens of the greatest credibility and to ensure the donor does not have access to substances which may affect test results (water, chemicals, substitute urine, etc.).<br />Service provider shall address the following specimen requisitions:</p>
<p>&bull; Security Seal<br />&bull; Specimen Label<br />&bull; Donor Information &amp; Collector Verification<br />&bull; Chain-Of-custody procedures <br />4.2 RANDOM DRUG TESTING AND STEROID SCREENING</p>
<p>At the beginning of each workweek, DS will forward to the Contractor's Project Management Office (PMO) based in Afghanistan (a site lead may be provided in Jerusalem) a list of at least 15 employees per site, per week identified to undergo Substance Screening. To assist with the Contractor's data entry process, the employee rosters will be in a format as directed by Contractor. The in-country Contractor PMO will contact DS to address any questions or concerns. The Contractor's designated site lead will coordinate with the DS's designated site representative (a minimum of one for each of the aforementioned sites) to schedule random drug screening.</p>
<p>DS will provide the drug test appointment information to the employee in accordance with the DS's random drug test guidelines, not more than two hours in advance (i.e. as unannounced as possible). The DS-designated site representative and the Contractor's designated site lead shall jointly resolve any potential scheduling conflicts concerning the employee and the DS-designated appointment time. The DS's employee will complete the substance screening (if necessary) at their reserved time period. The DS employee must be accompanied by his or her supervisor or DS-designated point of contact.</p>
<p>For drug testing, the Contractor will verify the identity of the employee, use a rapid urine test for the initial screen and obtain, when required, a urine specimen for a secondary screening. Immediate or close to immediate results are expected. After a secondary non-negative screening, the urine specimen will then be prepared and shipped to a CONUS SAMHSA-certified laboratory for analysis using strict chain of custody procedures (See Section 2).</p>
<p>If any of the drug screen results are negative, they will be documented using a Contractor-provided digital documentation system which will have all relevant schedules, results, and identification information. This digital documentation system will be updated on a weekly basis. Access to the system will be provided to DS's designated representatives in Afghanistan and Jerusalem and the DS program management U.S. office. If the Substance Screening results are negative, the Contractor will document and submit a negative report to DSs' designated representative as a separate monthly report.</p>
<p>If the Substance Screening results are non-negative, the urine specimen will be screened in a second rapid kit. If the second screen presents as a non-negative, the Contractor will immediately notify DS. The same urine specimen will then be prepared and shipped to a laboratory for analysis and confirmatory testing. Once the results are back, the Contractor will update its documentation as required and forward the results to DS's designated representative within one week for disposition.</p>
<p>The Contractor must also test for the evidence of an adulterant, dilution, and/or substitution of the sample. If there are indications of adulterant use, the Contractor must cease the test and immediately notify DS. Direct observation of a collection may be necessary per DS discretion. Documentation of the incident must be submitted to DS within 24 hours. All employees must undergo random Substance Screening at least once every six months. At the end of every six-month period, the Contractor will provide a full report documenting the number of tests conducted, all results, and any related information.</p>
<p>4.3 NON-RANDOM (POST INCIDENT, REASONABLE SUSPICION, FOLLOW-UP, ETC.) DRUG TESTING</p>
<p>DS will initiate all non-random Substance Screenings. The Contractor's designated site lead will reserve a slot at its clinic to perform the non-random Substance Screening on one hour's notice. Accordingly, the Contractor's designated site lead must be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to answer these requests. DS's designated representative or supervisor will accompany the employee for any post-incident or reasonable suspicion testing. The DS employee will complete the non-random drug screen at the Contractor's clinic.</p>
<p>If the Substance Screening results are negative, the information will be documented and provided to DS. If the Substance Screening results are non-negative, the urine specimen will be screened in a second rapid kit and DS shall be notified immediately (See Section 4.1 screening procedures). If the second screen presents as a non-negative, the same urine specimen will be prepared and shipped to a laboratory for analysis and confirmatory testing. Once the results are back, the Contractor will update its documentation as required and forward the results to DS's designated representative within five days for disposition. Upon a DS-initiated non-random test, the Contractor shall conduct such non-random testing prior to any random drug testing the Contractor has scheduled.<br /><br />Definitions</p>
<p>DS Direct Hires: Diplomatic Security career employees.<br />Employee: All-encompassing term for DS direct hires, personal services contractors, or third party contractors.<br />Non-Random: Non-Random screening will be at the request of DS and may occur anytime during a 24 hour period as a result of a post incident such as a vehicle accident, or if there is reasonable suspicion of illicit drug or steroid use, or as a follow-up to a previous incident.<br />Personal Services Contractors: Employees who have a limited direct contract with the U.S. Government<br />Random: Random screening will be on a semiannual basis (every six months). Therefore the completion of the semiannual screening shall occur six months after contract start date and continue every six months thereafter. <br />Third Party Contractors: Employees of a contract company providing services to the U.S. Government. All personnel have an employee to employer relationship and separate agreements which shall not deviate from the terms of the U.S. Government contract.<br />________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />It is requested that all interested parties submit their capabilities by email to Adam D. Hiland at <a href="mailto:HilandAD@state.gov">HilandAD@state.gov</a> addressing the above requirements by 3:00 pm EST, May 31, 2013.&nbsp; Interested parties shall also complete the Contractor Information Sheet attached hereto.<br /><br />If you have any questions or comments, please reference this Sources Sought (RFI) Notice when calling or emailing.<br /><br />At this time, the Department of State does not guarantee that any future contracts may be awarded covering the aforementioned duties and responses to this Sources Sought Notice do not bind the U.S. Department of State to any agreement with responding parties, be it explicit or implied.</p>

The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990.  Work will begin in September 2013 and will extend over a 6 month period.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. <br>  <br> The work consists of stabilizing approximately 1,300 feet of riverbank along the Connecticut River in Middletown, Connecticut on the eastern side of the Municipal John S. Roth Well Field on River Road.   The work is required to stabilize the shoreline and prevent further erosion of the riverbank.  The completed project will be turned over to the city of Middletown.  The construction will be conducted in the wet.  To reduce construction sedimentation, the contractor will employ a floating silt curtain in the river.   <br>  <br> The construction will consist of a stone toe along the bank below the water surface which will be buried, and then a layer stone revetment leading up the slope at which point the revetment will become recessed and covered with a layer of topsoil that will continue up the remainder of the bank to the crest.  The construction will follow the existing topography of the land adjacent to the river.  The topsoil will then be planted with native herbaceous and small shrub vegetation which will extend to the crest of the slope.  The upper crest of the slope will then be re-planted with native trees.   The upper portion of the bank above the stone revetment will be covered with biodegradable erosion fabric and vegetated with woody shrubs and vines with the stone revetment placed along the lower section and along the toe of the bank.  Land equipment will be required for excavation and movement of materials.  It should also be noted that space for staging of equipment and materials will be on site, with access from River Road.   <br>    <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications of the team and experience in performing the work requirements stated above.   Please include at least two specific examples of the firm's experience.   Proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are due May 20, 2013.

The two passenger elevators operate in the North Tower of the dam and serve eleven floors and 634 feet of vertical distance. The new elevator hoist equipment consists of Hollister-Whitney Elevator Corporation Overhead Traction #74 Machines (with Drum Brake). <br>  <br> The Downstream/P2 counterweight ropes rub on the rope gripper base during travel, and the maintenance contractor requires this problem be remedied as the last requirement before acceptance. In addition, the brake assembly on P2 was not properly set up, calibrated, or lubricated, nor were its sensor wires connected, by the refurbish contractor, and this condition remains. In December 2012, an event occurred that caused overheating on the gearbox at the thrust bearing end; the contractor maintenance mechanic who was there during the event believed there might be a problem with the thrust bearing; subsequently, another contractor maintenance mechanic operated and inspected P1 and, only witnessing normal operation, believed the overheating event was most likely result of the brake shoes not disengaging during the previous operation. P2 has been out of service since 20 December 2012.  <br>  <br> Upon inspection it was determined that the thrust bearings and sleeve bearings need replacement on the Downstream/P2 North Tower Elevator.  Access to these bearings is limited as the system is approximately one foot away from a concrete wall.  Services would require, but are not limited to, accessing the bearing housing, diagnostic services to address the bearing and shaft faults, replacing the needed bearings, supplying all applicable parts and supplies, and conducting a safety load test to ensure normal operation. <br>  <br> Full and complete requirements will be provided in a future solicitation if issued.

<DESC>The Air Force Distributed Common Ground System is a worldwide, network centric system of fixed and deployable, scalable and modular ground station components that provide multi-source intelligence data to the warfighter. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing, and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS is part of the overall DoD DCGS architecture and consists of core locations, remote sites, and a robust dissemination system. The Communications Modernization solution will be used to replace the current legacy ATM network throughout the AF DCGS enterprise. The current legacy ATM network successfully transports serial sensor bitstreams, non-serial imaging sensors bitstreams (both stills and full motion video), and imagery (full and motion), voice, avionics bitstreams, and data as received from reconnaissance aircraft aloft overseas to various AF DCGS sites, where processing takes place. Following successful processing, products are commonly sent over IP networks to consumers. The IP networks used to transport products to consumers is not being replaced.
<p>The goal is to allow the AF DCGS enterprise to take advantage of emerging high-speed deterministic technologies to meet the requirements of moving very large amounts non-processed bitstreams in real-time, with extremely low bit error rates, and with deterministic (fixed latency, precision-timed -latency) capabilities using a converged network topology.</p>

<DESC>This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP) for competitive proposals; however, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a sole source contract based on the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) states this authority shall be used, "When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by -- (i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities...". FEMA intends to award this contract to Advanced Power Control, Inc. for building maintenance system upgrades which are considered commercial services in accordance with FAR Part 2. This action is being performed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) which states, "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, ..., and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." A classified Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition submitted by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and approved by the Contracting Officer and FEMA's legal counsel is on file in FEMA's National Continuity Acquisition Branch office.
<p>DHS/FEMA/MWEOC, Operations &amp; Maintenance Division has a requirement to replace/upgrade central components of the existing Building Maintenance System (BMS) located at the Mt. Weather Emergency Operation Center (MWEOC). This requirement includes replacement of the servers and operator workstations which have reached the end of their service life. The replacement/upgrade of this equipment will allow for future expansion and improved redundancy/reliability of the existing BMS. In addition, modifications to the field equipment will be required to interface with the new servers/workstations. The upgraded BMS shall use the existing BMS wide area network. The estimated period of performance to complete these services is 7 calendar months from date of contract award. A portion of the BMS equipment to be upgraded under this requirement is located in a classified area which requires a TOP SECRET security clearance to access. Contractor personnel with active TOP SECRET clearances and a TOP SECRET level contractor facility clearance will be required.</p>
<p>Advanced Power Control, Inc. (APC) is currently performing preventive and remedial maintenance on BMS equipment located at the DHS, FEMA, MWEOC. Their service technicians are factory trained to replace/upgrade MWEOC's existing BMS equipment, as well as modify the existing field equipment in order to interface with the new servers/workstations. In addition, APC's technicians have the required TOP SECRET clearances and APC has a facility clearance at the TOP SECRET level. Thus, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Advanced Power Control, Inc. is considered the only responsible source capable of satisfying DHS/FEMA's requirements to replace/upgrade central components of the existing BMS located at the MWEOC. DHS/FEMA is unaware of any other sources capable of providing services to replace/upgrade MWEOC's existing BMS and capable of providing TOP SECRET cleared technicians, as well as a TOP SECRET level contractor facility clearance. However, any company capable of providing an equivalent level of service may submit a detailed capabilities statement in order to allow the Government to perform an evaluation of your proposed capabilities/qualifications. This information should be emailed to Phyllis.Woodward@fema.dhs.gov , or faxed to 540-542-2631, no later than 12:00 PM on May 15, 2013. Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<RESPDATE>053013
<CONTACT>Susan Nsangou, Phone 3014969351, Email susan.nsangou@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI.) This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, marketing materials or quotations, but rather an exploration into the technical issues that might underpin a future solicitation to accomplish its intended goals. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes.<br />1. BACKGROUND<br />The Clinical Center (CC) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest hospital in the world dedicated solely to clinical research. The CC complex is comprised of a 240-bed inpatient facility, outpatient clinics, and day hospitals and provides care to patients enrolled in clinical research protocols conducted by the Institutes and Centers that compose the NIH. Its patients come from around the country and the world to participate in research studies, often as a last hope for uncovering a diagnosis or providing a treatment. The portfolio of research studies conducted at the NIH CC is comprised mostly of natural history studies and clinical trials, more than 90% of which are phase I and II studies testing new drugs and treatments. Thus, the primary mission of the hospital is clinical research and the hospital's primary &lsquo;product' is the translation of basic science findings into clinical medicine.<br />The NIH, like the rest of the federal government, is facing continued tight budget times and, therefore, is compelled to develop and test new strategies to contain costs. The budget of the NIH CC, situated organizationally within the Department of Health and Human Services, is provided by the NIH Institutes and Centers who use this research hospital to conduct their clinical research protocols. In its 60-year history, the CC has never billed for its services- Approximately 10% of the CC's $400 million annual budget is spent on drugs. Containing costs within this component of the budget is the subject of this RFI.<br />Studies conducted at the CC often use investigational medications; commercially available medications as part of a research question (e.g., as part of a combination regimen, or repurposing of agents for non-approved indications); commercially available medications as supportive care for the research medications; and, commercially available medications for patient conditions not related to their participation in the research study but considered essential for adherence to the clinical research protocol. In support of these protocols, the CC Pharmacy Department provides take home/mail-out orders of approximately 100,000 prescriptions annually, including investigational drugs. Protocol-related, commercially-available drugs (such as pain medications, anti-emetics, HIV antiretrovirals) as well as investigational drugs are provided to all patients, regardless of their insurance status (which is currently not known). NIH has never billed third party payers. Because the CC has never entered into electronic financial transactions with payers or providers, we were viewed as not subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The hospital is currently subject to the Public Health Service Privacy Act of 1973 but is working towards HIPAA compliance. <br />The CC is considering asking its patients to request payment from their insurers for outpatient pharmaceuticals that are not the focus of the investigational protocol in which they are participating. The CC is pursuing whether we can find a partner who can provide the expertise and infrastructure necessary to accomplish these tasks. We are specifically seeking a mechanism that assures that our patients (i.e., actually our partners in these clinical research studies and &lsquo;co-producers' of our &lsquo;product') bear no expense, as they are volunteers in these studies. The CC estimates that the partnership organization could dispense approximately 50-75% of prescribed, commercially available drugs.<br />Attached are two workflows to demonstrate the process of filling prescriptions at the CC outpatient pharmacy.<br />2. PURPOSE of this RFI<br />The purpose of the RFI is to explore the feasibility of a partnership with an entity capable of filling take-home prescriptions, including those drugs available from only specialty pharmacies. The entity will be responsible for third party insurance identification, adjudication, and billing. A guiding principle of this program is that CC patients will not incur any expense (i.e. copays or deductibles) as a result of their participation in studies conducted at NIH. <br />SCOPE of POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP<br />&bull; The NIH CC Pharmacy is seeking a partner to provide dispensing of commercially available medications, including those dispensed through specialty pharmacies for any "take home" prescriptions written for patients with prescription insurance coverage. CC patients who do not have any insurance coverage (approximately 15%, based on prior surveys) are outside of the scope of this project; their outpatient pharmaceuticals will continue to be supplied by the CC pharmacy.<br />&bull; The partner would determine the most efficient delivery method for the pharmaceuticals.<br />&bull; The partner would need to have the ability to deliver products to patients across the U.S. and seek reimbursement from a variety of payers.<br />&bull; The CC Pharmacy could provide the initial "starter supply" to bridge patients until the filled prescription order is received by the patient, assuming reasonable turnaround time.<br />&bull; The CC Pharmacy would need the partner to make real-time determinations of coverage for each pharmaceutical prescription at the time the prescription is generated, so that the CC pharmacy can fill those that will not be covered.<br />&bull; Because of the strict requirement of these research protocols, drug substitutions would not be permissable.<br />&bull; All transactions must be cost neutral to the patient.<br />&bull; The partner would be responsible for fulfilling all authorized refills.<br />&bull; A mechanism is needed to transmit clinically-relevant information about prescription filling and refilling by the partner to the CC Pharmacy.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />3. INFORMATION REQUESTED</p>
<p>&bull; Can the potential partner provide all commercially available pharmaceutical products, including those distributed by specialty pharmacies? <br />o For pharmaceutical products requiring pre-authorization by the payer, what process/processes might be followed for these prescriptions?<br />o If the partner is unable to access all specialty pharmacies, how can the number of sources/shipments be minimized?<br />o What would be required from a regulatory perspective for the partner to dispense controlled substances?<br />o Is it feasible for the partner to fill inexpensive prescriptions not covered by the patient's insurance or for uninsured patients? <br />&bull; How can the payer's requirement for co-payment be managed such that filling the prescription is cost-neutral to the patient?<br />&bull; What mechanisms are available for the partner to receive prescription orders and patient insurance information since the CC is currently not a covered entity under HIPAA? <br />o What physical space onsite and equipment would be needed for each of the proposed mechanisms?<br />&bull; What mechanism is available for weekend prescription coverage by the partner?<br />&bull; What would be the expected overall turn-around time (i.e., time from prescription acceptance to patient receipt of pharmaceuticals), and what are the anticipated turnaround times for the component processes involved?<br />o Would there be any special information needed to make this determination given that our patients will be on research studies?<br />o What kind of information is typically needed for drugs that require "prior approval"? How can this information be provided to minimize the involvement of the prescriber and the time required to obtain approval?<br />o To what degree would a prescriber need to be involved if there are questions around a particular prescription from a payer? <br />&bull; What mechanisms are available for the CC Pharmacy to receive relevant clinical information about prescription fills and refills from the partnership organization and how could these data be recorded in the Clinical Center's Clinical Research Information System? <br />&bull; What customer support would be provided to patients?</p>
<p>Responses to the RFI are to be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer. Respondents are requested to provide an index which addresses the information requested. Page limit is up to 30 pages (references, workflows or charts excluded.) The CC is requesting the respondent's technical and administrative points of contact, including name, address, phone number and email address. <br />Disclaimer and Important Notes<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>Confidentiality: No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits."

Failure to be properly registered at the time and date of award may render the quote non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Douglas Lowrey, at douglas.lowrey@us.army.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC><p>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to exercise FAR clause 52.217-8, option to extend services; a modification on a sole source basis to Booz Allen Hamilton, Incorporated, 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, Virginia, 22102-4904 for 13,137 hours of Engineering and Technical Services along with associated Travel, Material, and NMCI under contract N00421-12-C-0001 for the continuance of technical and engineering services to support continued design, engineering, acquisition, integration, installation, training, operational support, and in-service engineering for Combat Identification, Air Traffic Control, and Electronic Countermeasures systems while the follow-on is being completed. This modification covers an extended period of performance of one (1) month with a one (1) month option for transition if required. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under contract N00421-12-C-0001 and the need to continue these services; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of services until award of the competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 13 May 2013, 1630 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. Any questions shall be submitted to Maria Mattei-Chaney, Code 2.5.4.3 via email (maria.mattei-chaney@navy.mil). <br />Per FAR 6.302-1 "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agony requirements.' These services include requirements to support the Fleet with the ability to positively identify and track cooperative and non-cooperative targets in both combat and air traffic control environments for the Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and other customers. Services are currently being performed by Booz Allen Hamilton under contract N00421-12-C-0001. As a result of sponsor requirements, all options and all available ceiling are projected to be expended by 31 May 2013. Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating an impact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation number is RFQ-RT-13-000049 and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-55.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541712 ? Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences which it has a size standard of 500 employees to qualify as a small business, is applicable. This procurement is to acquire Natural Organic Matter (NOM). The Government intends to award a firm fixed-price contract for an 8 month period of performance. 
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT: The contractor shall conduct laboratory field work (on location at a surface water location or surface water locations proposed and accepted by the U.S, EPA) to prepare concentrated natural organic matter (NOM).  Chemical disinfection of drinking water is a major public health triumph of the 20th century, resulting in significant decreases in morbidity and mortality from waterborne diseases.  Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are chemicals formed by the reaction of oxidizing disinfectants with NOM and inorganic chemicals in the source water. To date more than 600 unique DBPs have been identified. Despite this massive identification effort, much of the mass of total organic halide (TOX) formed as a result of disinfection remains unidentified.  The quantified DBPs account for typically less than 50% of TOX when considering disinfection with chlorine and much less of the TOX when considering disinfection with chloramine. Quantitative concentration data are t ypically available for between 20 and 30 compounds, including the four regulated THMs, the five regulated and four other chlorinated and brominated haloacetic acids (HAAs), four haloacetonitriles, aldehydes, chloral hydrate, chloropicrin, and bromate.  Historically, most other DBPs have been identified by qualitative analyses only; thus, the size of the unknown fraction is large. In contrast to the large number of DBPs that have been identified, few of the known DBPs have undergone toxicological investigations usable for risk assessment.  It is not possible to conduct toxicological evaluation of all known DBPs or even a sizable fraction of them.  Even if this could be accomplished, a chemical-by-chemical approach would not provide information on either interactions among and between the DBPs or the toxicity of the unidentified fraction.  Additional motivation for research with complex mixtures comes from the fact that while most experimental animal toxicity data are from sin gle-chemical studies, human epidemiological studies provide data on exposure to DBP mixtures.  Some human epidemiological studies show positive, but weak, associations between human exposure to chlorinated water and such adverse health effects as increased spontaneous abortions, increased duration of menstrual cycles, stillbirth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age infancy, birth defects, bladder cancer and colon/rectal cancer.  Thus, to address potential health concerns that cannot be answered directly by toxicological research on individual DBPs or defined DBP mixtures, toxicological research with environmentally realistic complex mixtures of DBPs is needed.  Such research can only be conducted with disinfected natural organic matter (NOM).

PURPOSE: The contractor shall identify surface water sources and prepare concentrated NOM from those identified sources. While the need for toxicological research with concentrates of NOM is recognized, the availability of concentrates has severely limited  progress in developing an improved understanding of  the potential human health risks associated with consumption and use of water disinfected with oxidizing agents.  Data are needed that provide insights into the relative toxicity of disinfection of the same source water with different disinfection scenarios. Such information may help guide water treatment plants as they change disinfectant strategies to ensure compliance with regulatory limits on the concentrations of DBPs in finished water.  The goal of this requirement is to provide NOM that will enable the necessary toxicological research. 	 SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK: Task 1. QA plan.  Within 3 weeks of award of the contract, the contractor shall provide a QA plan as described under Interim Deliverable 1. Task 2. Preparation of Powdered, Concentrated NOM. The contractor shall use reverse osmosis techniques, electrolyte dialysis and drying techniques to prepare concentrates of NOM suitable for use in both in vivo and in vitro toxicology studies.  The contractor shall conduct field studies and produce water concentrates using reverse osmosis techniques from the water sources identified by the Contractor. These concentrates shall, either in the field or in the laboratory, undergo electrodialysis for removal of electrolytes; then, the NOM contained in the concentrates shall be dried into powder.  Note that the NOM must be concentrated during the higher NOM months of the year (May, June, July, August, September, October) and must be collected, concentrated and prepared in 2013.  The contractor shall c ollect information on the actual water source(s) from which the NOM is being concentrated, along with information on the volumes filtered per unit time and total water filtered as well as information on the starting total organic carbon concentration, the final total organic carbon concentration, the volumetric concentration factor, the concentration factor based on the increase in total organic carbon, and the inorganic characterization of the NOM (the concentrations of bromide, iodide, aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, calcium, cadmium,  chromium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, hardness) shall be included.  NOM must be isolated from a minimum of 150,000 liters of water, with a minimum yield of 1.6 kilograms of NOM produced.
DELIVERABLES: The contractor shall submit the following deliverables to the EPA in the form of a written report: Interim Deliverable 1.  (associated with Task 1: QA plan) The first interim deliverable shall consist of a quality assurance plan, specific to the performance of the Statement of Work, for preparation of NOM.  The QA plan shall cite appropriate references and shall include the number of reverse osmosis units to be used in the effort, their capacity in terms of volume of water filtered per hour and the manufacturer of the unit. The same information (number of units, capacity, manufacturer) shall be provided for any electrodialysis units to be used in the project.  The procedure for removal of water shall be specified in detail.   The level of detail shall be consistent with that contained in a standard operating procedure.  Interim deliverable1 is due 3 work weeks (15 working days) after award of the contract.  Interim Deliverable 2 (associated with Task 2: NOM prep aration) The second interim deliverable shall consist of specific information on the water source(s) and their locations, with data on total organic carbon, natural constituents such as bromide  and iodide and potential or actual background contaminants that may be concentrated along with the NOM.  Information shall be included on known public and/or private water utilities that draw their source water from the proposed source at the proposed location. If the utility/utilities request confidentiality the Contractor must withhold the utility/utilities name. The second interim deliverable shall be due 6 work weeks (30 working days) after award of the contract.  Interim Deliverable 3: (associated with Task 2: NOM preparation) The third interim deliverable shall consist of a progress report on NOM concentrate preparation.  The report shall include information on the actual water source(s) from which the NOM is being concentrated, along with information on the volumes filtered pe r unit time to date, total water filtered to date, and the projected amount of water to be filtered over the course of the sampling cycle.  Preliminary information on the starting total organic carbon concentration, the final total organic carbon concentration, the volumetric concentration factor, the concentration factor based on the increase in total organic carbon,  and the inorganic characterization of the NOM (the concentrations of bromide, iodide, aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, calcium, cadmium,  chromium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, hardness) shall be included.    The third interim deliverable shall be due no earlier than 15 working days and no later than 45 working days after beginning of NOM concentration at the field location.Final Deliverable: The final deliverable shall be the concentrated NOM, with data detailing the specifics of its preparation, such as the starting total organic carbon concentration, the final total organic carbon con centration, the volumetric concentration factor, the concentration factor based on the increase in total organic carbon,  and the inorganic characterization of the NOM (the concentrations of bromide, iodide, aluminum, arsenic, barium, beryllium, calcium, cadmium,  chromium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, hardness).

The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations including the United Nations agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan, Jakarta, Indonesia and Cairo, Egypt. <br />The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs), with the exception of Costa Rica, where the office is headed by a Senior Regional Advisor (SRA). The PRAs and SRA report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. The PRA and SRA serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, <br />supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington based Regional Coordinators, the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. Staff assigned to regional and country offices coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the respective region of responsibility. <br />OFDA operates an office headquartered at the USAID Mission in Port au Prince, Haiti to effectively respond to humanitarian emergencies as well as increase capacity for disaster risk reduction in Haiti. This office is responsible for overseeing the portfolio of OFDA-funded activities in Haiti. Conditions in Haiti set it apart from other countries in the Caribbean region. While hydro-meteorological disasters have been the most persistent in this highly impoverished nation, two events in 2010 (the 7.0 magnitude earthquake in January 2010 and cholera outbreak later that same year) nearly eclipsed all prior natural disasters in terms of the highest numbers of deaths and the greatest number of affected people. <br />While the ongoing effects of these two 2010 events continue to magnify the already high level of vulnerability of Haiti's population, hydro-meteorological events remain significant hazards, as seen by the impacts of Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy in 2012. Meanwhile, the Government of Haiti (GOH) lacks capacity at all levels to respond to these disasters. Thus OFDA foresees the need over the near term for continued significant response to natural disasters along with substantial support for disaster risk reduction interventions at the national, community and household levels that aim to increase capacity and strengthen resiliency in Haiti.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Senior Program Officer (SPO) to be based in Port au Prince, Haiti to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, resilience programming, strategic reporting, and interagency coordination for the Haiti portfolio are met.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA SPO will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency and disaster risk reduction efforts throughout Haiti. The SPO may be called upon to assist in humanitarian assistance activities elsewhere in the Latin American and Caribbean region as needed. <br />This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, Embassy staff, and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style. The SPO must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines. The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. government disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office. <br />The SPO's responsibilities will include the following: <br />&bull;	Serve as one of the principal points-of-contact for OFDA humanitarian issues in Haiti. <br />&bull;	Coordinate closely with USAID and Embassy staff and exchange information regularly with colleagues covering Haiti portfolios, as well as with the field and headquarters-based OFDA regional team. This includes sharing project ideas, strategies and soliciting advice and guidance. <br />&bull;	Provide program strategy development and implementation oversight for OFDA's response and disaster risk reduction in Haiti and ensure complementarity between the two strategies, and oversee implementation of each. <br />&bull;	Oversee field monitoring of OFDA programs and ensures reporting on humanitarian needs and programming in Haiti. <br />&bull;	Ensure assessment and monitoring of existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationships, and facilitation of award management activities. The SPO will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR) for all assigned areas. <br />&bull;	Assess a broad spectrum of emergency conditions to provide recommendations, management oversight and evaluation of OFDA response programs. <br />&bull;	Maintain regular contact with senior leadership within the humanitarian community and represent USAID and OFDA on humanitarian issues in Haiti. This will include but is not limited to UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs, U.S. Government personnel, donors, host government authorities, and others. <br />&bull;	Travel frequently within Haiti to assess, evaluate and monitor humanitarian conditions and make strategic recommendations for appropriate interventions. <br />&bull;	Engage in annual hurricane season preparations, working extensively with other stakeholders in the months leading up to the start of the season to ensure that OFDA, the USG and the international community are prepared to respond. <br />&bull;	Participate in and report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN-led assessments, and participate actively in the international community response structures.</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in Haiti. Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the Senior Regional Advisor (SRA) for Latin America, and the RA for Haiti, and the Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) in Washington current on response issues. Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts. <br />&bull;	With guidance from the RA for Haiti, coordinate with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs. <br />&bull;	Oversee all administrative functions at the field office level and coordinate travel for all humanitarian-related visitors, including VIPs. <br />&bull;	Prepare agendas and briefings for official U.S. Government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The SPO will take direction from and will report to the SRA (or his/her designee) who is responsible for the overall management of the LAC Regional Office but will communicate on a daily basis and closely coordinate with OFDA's RA for Haiti and his/her designee, as well as, maintain close coordination with the Disaster Operations Specialist in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>This may change for Response (the lead RA for response will most likely be the RA for Haiti but could be the SRA or another LAC RA depending on a variety of circumstances) but if so, will be clearly articulated by the LAC SRA or the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington (if a DART is stood up).</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined goals and objectives. The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with minimal direction and will exercise independent judgment in responding to humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.) (i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled ?Trade Agreements.? (ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly?

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>Please submit ONE (1) original plus three (3) copies of entire quotation.  Please mark original as "ORIGINAL" and copy as "COPY."</p>

<p>The Evaluation Criteria shall be applied in assessing quotations.  The criteria are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p><br />VOLUME 2:  TECHNICAL FACTORS:</p>
<p>1.	Technical Approach: (40 Points):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's response based upon how clearly the offeror's response addresses and describes the offeror's ability to complete/perform the work described in the Statement of Work (SOW) in enough detail that someone with a rudimentary knowledge of the subject would be able to understand the offeror's ability to perform the work.  The response must include emergency procedures that would be followed in the event of an unplanned incident.</p>
<p>2. 	Personnel Requirements or Staffing (30 Points):</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide resumes of key personnel that document work that is similar to the requirements stated in the Statement of Work and demonstrates the ability to meet the requirements as stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><br />3.		Past Performance: (30 Points):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance.  The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.  The past performance subfactors are listed below in order of relative importance.  These subfactors will be used to evaluate the quality of past performance.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Subfactors:<br />&bull;	Record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship<br />&bull;	Adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance<br />&bull;	Reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction<br />&bull;	Business-like concern for the interest of the customer</p>
<p><br />4.		Price    (Price will be evaluated separately but not scored).</p>

Or we must have a license?<br /><br />RESPONSE: <br /><br />The primary contractor must have the proper business licenses to perform in Okinawa. They can submit their subcontractor's qualifications; however, our contract will not be with the sub but the prime.

<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/><br/>****NOTICE:  THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN REVISED AS FOLLOWS****<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing M153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) systems and spare parts, recapitalization/reset/overhaul of previously delivered M153 CROWS systems, and CROWS engineering and logistics support.  The total contract value is estimated at $970M. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The U.S. Government intends to satisfy the above CROWS requirements through a Firm Fixed Price, Full and Open Competition, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), single award contract.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).  The SOW will include:<br/><br/>I. Production of CROWS (total quantity estimated at 3,000 systems) and spare parts.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 50 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 150 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Product improvements, integrations, and testing.   <br/><br/>III.    Training, overhaul, depot-level, field maintenance support, recapitalization/reset of CROWS, and general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification includes the performance requirements and technical drawings.  The detail specification states the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and how the components are to be fabricated or constructed.  The detail specification does not include technical drawings and assembly procedures for some sub-assemblies, which are to be made by qualified directed sources at least until the First Article Testing phase.  This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between the new CROWS producer and commonality/interchangeability with existing CROWS systems.  The U.S. Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation: <br/> <br/> - Detail Specification<br/> - Performance requirements<br/> - Technical Drawings<br/> - Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/> - Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/> - Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/> - Assembly procedures<br/> - List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/> - Quality requirements <br/> - Test requirements<br/> - Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be released nor will prospective contractors have access to it at any time. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the U.S. Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be addressed through a software change process between the U.S. Government and the prospective Contractor. <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be provided upon request after the Request for Proposals release provided that all prerequisite paper work (described below) is properly completed, submitted, and approved.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement<br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  All other foreign companies shall be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) requirements.  The countries of Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway are exempt from ITAR restrictions in accordance with 22 CFR 125.4(c) for the Pre-Solicitation Conference and solicitation; however these countries shall be ITAR compliant before a contract award.  This exemption will terminate on 25 August 2012.  All other countries shall obtain the appropriate licenses from the Department of State directly.  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (Other Foreign) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced.  <br/><br/>This announcement serves as notification that export control procedures regulated by the ITAR are in effect on the above stated data. Contractors interested in receiving this data must be in compliance with the ITAR and obtain the proper authorizations, which we encourage to do so as soon as possible.  The data will be marked Distribution Statement B  Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies only.   All other requests for this data shall be referred to Project Manager Soldier Weapons.  Foreign vendors and contractors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for Contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR.  Contractors may consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and may consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions they may have relating to compliance with the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).  Please reference the following link consulting these regulations http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers. The GFM may include full up M153 CROWS systems, select parts and weapons. Contractors must make the appropriate accommodations to be approved for handling and storage of weapons. The U.S. Government support may be provided to assist in understanding the setup and use of the M153 CROWS and its operation following contract award. <br/><br/>The current schedule projects a Pre-Solicitation Conference at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on 6 October 2011 and a solicitation release in November/December 2011.  Only contractors who have pre-registered for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will be admitted.  Please reference the Pre Solicitation Conference Requirements notice posted on 1 July 2011.<br/><br/>All responses to this notice shall be in writing in the English language and at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>In the best interest of the U.S. Government, the U.S. Government intends to
change the previously stated contract type in DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015 from
Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) to base with options.  The base 
with options contract type has been determined to be more favorable to the 
U.S. Government. The expected contract duration remains unchanged at five (5)
years and is intended to be a single award.

The Royalty Fee, if applicable, as referenced in DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015 shall 
be added to an Offerors proposal in the total price evaluation as per FAR 
27.202-2 and stated in both Sections L & M of DRAFT-W15QKN-11-R-F015. The 
royalty fee payments shall be paid by the U.S. Government in accordance with 
the Special License Agreement. The contract awardee is not required to pay the
royalty fee.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the U.S. Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI and all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any RFP, if one is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  <br>    <br>  Program Manager Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (PM-WIN-T) Increment 1 (Inc 1) seeks industry feedback regarding the Signal Modernization Program initiatives.  The Signal Modernization Program will transform and augment the Army's communication capabilities and extend the network to lower echelons via modular, scalable and interoperable nodes.  Operational requirements have pushed the need for nodes lower in the formation. These nodes will operate in commercial and military satellite bands and will support up to four enclaves with voice, data and video teleconferencing. These requirements will be executed via the Transmission Capability Production Document (CPD) and the Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) (CPD). Both CPD documents are still in the approval process with expected approval in 4QFY13 for T2C2 and late 1QFY14 for Transmission.  Formal guidance required to proceed with the acquisition program is being addressed with a Directed Requirement currently being staffed.    <br>    <br>  To demonstrate Signal Modernization initiatives, the Expeditionary Signal Battalion (ESB)  quote mark Proof of Concept quote mark  will demonstrate materiel and organizational changes in the ESB structure in order to provide increased network capacity / capabilities to support Command Posts (Company through Brigade) and to Install, Operate and Maintain (IOM) these capabilities without increasing organizational manning.   The intent is to reconfigure the 86th ESB at FT Bliss, TX and select Regional Hub Nodes (RHNs) to conduct a series of operational and system evaluations in FY 14-15.  These evaluations will include support to Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and Functional Brigades and will be conducted in conjunction with the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) sponsored Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs).  The US Army Signal Center of Excellence (SigCoE) will use the  quote mark Proof of Concept quote mark  to confirm that the ESB can provide increased capacity / capabilities within full spectrum operations; support additional Command Posts; meet IOM requirements within the ESB force structure and reduce signal footprint / strategic lift requirements.  <br>    <br>  Extension of the Army's network footprint will be addressed via the T2C2 program.  T2C2 provides small teams and company-sized early entry units robust voice and data communications capabilities in the early phases of joint operations. T2C2 supports Mission Command Applications and services. Variant 1 provides Global Information Grid (GIG) access to the small, highly dispersed team-size elements while At-the-Halt (ATH) on military satellites or commercial satellites. Variant 2 provides high capacity GIG connectivity to company size units command posts while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites.  <br>    <br>  Executive Summary  <br>    <br>  PM-WIN-T Inc 1is seeking industry feedback on five technology areas:  Terrestrial Line-of-Sight radios, Tropospheric Scatter technology, Deployable Cellular systems, Radio cross-banding, and Man-portable SATCOM systems.  <br>    <br>  Satellite communications is the primary connectivity between WIN-T Increment 1 and Increment 2 equipment. Incompatibilities between the terrestrial radios in the WIN-T increments cause inefficiencies in the network which are detrimental to military operations. PM WIN-T Inc 1 is looking for a solution that directly links WIN-T Increments 1 and 2 using high bandwidth terrestrial communications.    <br>    <br>  Additionally, PM WIN-T INC 1 is looking to replace the existing Tropospheric scatter (TROPO) communications equipment in the   ESBs   to provide greater throughput, require less manning and have significant deployment and employment advantages in size, weight, and power.  <br>    <br>  An interface to the WIN-T system is required to support soldier cellular data devices. These devices utilize a transport base station that will reside in WIN-T equipment. This capability is required at all command posts, echelons division through company, that are supported with WIN-T equipment. Cellular capability is also required at ESBs to support command posts that do not have organic WIN-T assets.  <br>    <br>  Provide small teams and company-sized early entry units robust voice and data communications capabilities in the early phases of joint operations. T2C2 supports Mission Command Applications and services. Variant 1 provides GIG access to the small, highly dispersed team-size elements while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites. Variant 2 provides high capacity GIG connectivity to company size units command posts while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites.  <br>    <br>  Finally, provide a solution allowing connections between telephones, combat net radios, first responder radios and voice applications into a single, on-call voice network. The capability to bridge disparate voice devices into a net will be available from Corps through company echelons. Network management for this capability resides at Corps through battalion echelons.  <br>    <br>  Requirements  <br>    <br>  Terrestrial Transmission System  <br>    <br>  PM WIN-T Inc 1seeks industry feedback regarding availability of a production representative  high capacity line of sight radio that will meet the terrestrial transmission requirement of the Tactical Network Modernization for the ESBs which will allow Soldiers to seamlessly communicate between WIN-T Increments. Currently, each WIN-T increment leverages different waveforms which are not compatible.  Inc 1 employs the HCLOS UHF radio in the AN/TRC-190 and Inc 2 is fielding the On-the-Move capable Highband Networking Waveform.  These incompatibilities between the terrestrial radios in the WIN-T increments cause inefficiencies in the network which are detrimental to military operations.   Therefore, PM WIN-T INC 1 is seeking terrestrial transmission hardware platform that shall be capable of porting waveforms used by WIN-T to allow interoperability between Increments.  <br>    <br>  The terrestrial transport shall provide 32 Mbps measured point to point) (threshold), and 48 Mbps (objective) data throughput at 30 km per link.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

<DESC><p>Amendment 0001 was created for this solicitation # SPRAL1-13-R-0002 in order to add CLIN 0001 &amp; CLIN 0002 and combine solicitations# SPRAL1-13-R-0002 (PR: 10000002867) and SPRAL1-13-R-0010 (PR: 1000005781). Both solicitations are for the same NSN. Total new quantity after Amendment 0001 is 87 pieces to be delivered to SW3121 or Albany, GA. In addition, due to system limitations, the previous solicitation number, SPRAL1-13-R-0002 and SPRAL1-13-R-0010 had to be cancelled and a new solicitation number given because of the additional CLINs. The new solicitation number will be, SPRAL1-13-R-0069.

Both solicitations are for the same NSN. Total new quantity after Amendment 0001 is 87 pieces to be delivered to SW3121 or Albany, GA. In addition, due to system limitations, the previous solicitation number, SPRAL1-13-R-0002 and SPRAL1-13-R-0010 had to be cancelled and a new solicitation number given because of the additional CLINs. The new solicitation number will be, SPRAL1-13-R-0069. The reason for the new solicitation number is because the procurement writing system does not allow for increasing of quantities but instead adding additional lines.</p>

<DESC>Attention: Funding for this requirement is currently not available but is anticipated for this fiscal year. In the event funding is not received the solicitation will be cancelled and no award will be made.
<p><br />Forest Service Road (FSR) 29, M.P. 9.2, Culvert Replacement. The Olympic National Forest intends to acquire by contract installation of an 84-inch diameter, structural plate, pipe arch on FSR 29, at M.P. 9.2. Project work consists of the following major items of work: removal and disposal of the existing culvert; excavation of new stream channels; clearing and grubbing; haul of excavated material and borrow; seeding and mulching.</p>
<p>This project is located on the Pacific Ranger District of the Olympic National Forest: Sections 2, Township 28 N, Range 12 W, W.M., near Forks, Washington. It may be reached by traveling north from Forks, Washington, on HWY 101 for approximately 2 miles to Forest Service Road (FSR) No. 29. Proceed on FSR 29 for 9.22 miles.</p>
<p>Period for performance is from date of award to August 15, 2013.</p>
<p>Project Manager is Mr. Kevin Gu, 360-956-2415.</p>
<p>The Forest Service will proceed to issue a solicitation as a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about MAY 13, 2013. This acquisition is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns. The Forest Service will award a firm fixed-price contract to that responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and has been determined to be the best value to the Forest Service. Offers will be evaluated based upon: price; experience, past performance, managers &amp; subcontractors, price realism, and a Level of Confidence Assessment Rating (LOCAR). The government estimated value is between $150,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p>A bid bond is required. Performance and payment bonds are required for this project. Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to any resulting contract. The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government. Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the SAM on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by contacting askSAM@gsa.gov, or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>For additional information contact Miley Sutherland, Contracting Officer at 360-956-2471, and Guadalupe Cisneros, Project Engineer, at (360) 956-2353, or Kevin Gu, Project Engineer, at (360) 956-2415.</p>

<DESC>SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD<br />This amendment modifies the 1st (first) paragraph on page 78 in the solicitation. Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) participation has been removed as an evaluation factor. The paragraph is deleted and replaced in its entirety as follows:
<p>1. GENERAL<br />Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on evaluation of proposals against three factors. The factors in order of importance are: technical, cost, and past performance. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, past performance, and cost/price are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to modify the existing contract (N66604-13-P-0941) with Sarnoff International (SRI) by incorporating a new requirement to provide engineering services in support of NUWC Imaging Special Project Programs. Specifically, under this program SRI will work  toward implementing the AGLG+MDCP (De-haze) algorithm onto the Acadia II Video Card. The level of effort for this new tasking is approximately 122 labor hours and will not impact the original period of performance. For the reasons stated below, the Governemnt intends to issue the modification to SRI.

NUWC Division Newport intends to place a purchase order with Sarnoff International (SRI) to support analysis and modifications of the Acadia II Video Card.
 This piece of hardware and software is based off of a design that SRI has developed over the past 15 years. SRI therefore gained significant expertise in the design and performance of this component, and is the only vendor capable of modifying or testing this component. Going to another contractor would incur unacceptable cost and schedule impacts to the project. This requirement will be solicited in accordance with the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is a synopsis and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the U.S. Navy to procure subject items. Additional information will be provided upon the release of solicitation number N6660413T0941, which is expected to be on or about 30 Jan 2012. NAICS code is 541330, Solicitation is unrestricted.
 For information on this acquisition contact Michael H. Broomfield at 401-832-8469 or e-mail at michael.h.broomfield@navy.mil. All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps and NECO. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation. For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.

<a href="mailto:stephen.ciliberto@navy.mil">Email Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire, through full and open competition, modeling and simulation services in support of the office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) Assessment Division's (N81) warfare and warfare support analyses efforts. This requirement is for the procurement of professional services in the areas of model development, engineering, training and demonstration of modeling, simulation, modifications, and analysis techniques in support of N81's mission. Their mission is to provide a comprehensive methodology and supporting review process that defines Navy warfighting capability and capacity requirements and warfighting wholeness; identify both near and far-term capacity and capability shortfalls and gaps; and provide quantitative and qualitative measures suitable for supporting value-based trades between disparate components of overall Navy capacity and capability.

N81's role as the single OPNAV analytic organization includes:

-Coordinate and prioritize all OPNAV analysis efforts

-Conduct all campaign, capability and force structure requirements analysis

-Conduct analysis of key support area issues

-Develop analytic tool improvements ("World Class Models")

-Lead development of Center for Naval Analysis (CNA) Annual Plan and Integrated Analytic Agenda

-Lead Navy's analytic engagement with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint Staff, including OPNAV participation in OSD's Support to Strategic Analysis

-Approve study plans for all Navy-led Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs) and Capabilities-Based Assessments (CBAs)

-Assess magnitude and priority of capability gaps and programmatic solutions

-Manage accreditation of price-performance models



The work objectives to be performed under this requirement include design, development, evaluation, and modification of a wide range of OPNAV models that support the Program Objectives Memorandum (POM) decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the-art set of models, methods, tools, and data for use in warfighting and warfighting support analyses.

The models will encompass all aspects of joint campaign, mission and engagement level modeling, as well as manpower and personnel, training and education, infrastructure, long-term planning, policy, medical logistics planning, and both afloat and ashore readiness.
 Model development efforts will include: physics-based kinetic warfare models; information and decision making models; and econometric personnel management, readiness (maintenance, supply, training and support equipment) and logistics management models.


For planning purposes only, it is estimated that the requirement will call for 362,400 hours of effort over the life of the contracts. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.

However, interested parties may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a Commercial item. Under this requirement, the Government intends to make multiple awards for the entire contract.
 The awarded contracts will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) - Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with a ordering period beginning around 1 January 2014 and continuing through 31 December 2016. 

The specific actions and/or tasks required under these contracts will be identified on individual task orders issued under these contracts. Travel will be required in support of this requirement.

The Request for Proposals (RFP) will require the submission of a non-price/cost volume as well as a price/cost volume.

The Navy's evaluation of proposals will consider the offeror's non-price/cost proposal significantly more important than the offeror's price/cost proposal.
 The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511; size standard $25.5M. The FSC is D399. 

All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by NAVSUP FLC Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office. The RFP will be made available electronically upon its release at www.neco.navy.mil. Paper copies, faxed copies, or e-mail copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the RFP and any amendments thereto.

The Government will not pay for information received. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or around 14 May 2013. The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP.
 Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be considered for award. See www.sam.gov for further information and instructions. Further, offerors are required to go on-line to the SAM website to complete their Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to submittal of a proposal. Any questions regarding this announcement should be submitted via email to stephen.ciliberto@navy.mil.

<p><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 6.303-2</p>
<p>1. IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>Approval is requested to enter into a sole source contract with the contractor indicated below to obtain construction services for the "Emergency ACM Abatement and Dehumidification of First and Second Floor", Chet Holifield Federal Building, 24000 Avila Rd., Laguna Niguel, CA 92677.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>&bull;The construction services required under this justification include emergency ACM abatement, water damage treatment, dehumidification and drywall repair and painting. The estimated construction cost is $500,120.00<br />&bull;Some of these specialized requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: <br />&bull;Set up localized containment and install negative air machines and dehumidifiers within the work areas, throughout 1st and 2nd Floors.<br />&bull;Remove all water damaged asbestos containing drywall / joint compound, throughout 1st and 2nd floors.<br />&bull;If pre-existing mold growth and/or suspect staining is observed during the removal process, the mold contaminated asbestos containing drywall / joint compound shall be removed 2 ft. beyond any visible extent, throughout 1st and 2nd floors.<br />&bull;Apply anti-microbial cleaning agent and scrub framing members with wire brush, 2ft. beyond the extent of visible suspect mold and/or staining.<br />&bull;The visual presence of continued staining and/or mold growth into adjacent areas warrants the cleaning and/or removal of the affected materials.<br />&bull;All exposed surfaces shall be sanded and/or wire brushed and HEPA Vacuumed until a visually clean surface is achieved.</p>
<p>&bull;Upon completion wet wipe remediated areas with an anti microbial cleaning detergent and HEPA vacuum a second time.<br />&bull;All exposed HVAC vents and/or registers shall be cleaned accordingly within the 1st &amp; 2nd floor work areas.<br />&bull;Daily &amp; final visual inspections and onsite air monitoring for asbestos &amp; mold will be conducted by an H2 Environmental representative.<br />&bull;Patch, repair, paint drywall for First and Second Floor in contained area.<br />&bull;Patch, repair, paint drywall for Third Floor.</p>
<p><br />3.IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORTIY</p>
<p>Authority for this action is provided at 41 U.S.C.253(c)(2), which states, "the executive agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals." Also see FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency.</p>
<p><br />4.DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF AUTHORITY CITED</p>
<p>On Saturday, March 23, 2013, flooding was discovered due to a 6 inch domestic supply water pipe burst on the third floor at the Chet Holifield Federal Building by the O&amp;M contractor, ABM Janitorial Services - Southwest, Inc. The flood affected the first, second, and third floors. The affected area is estimated to be 110,000 square feet of space. Many different agencies and public areas were impacted. A company was brought in immediately to remove the water from the three (3) floors; however, they did not have the capability to provide the dehumidification services and water damage treatment at the scale and speed with which this project required. Many of the agency spaces are damaged affecting operations of many of the tenants. The building envelope is at risk due to mold concerns and continues to escalate the longer the areas are not treated.</p>
<p><br />5.DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS TO SOLICIT AS MANY OFFERS AS PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>Competition was contemplated however not utilized for emergency procurement due to urgency of this procurement. This requirement required a specific set of specialized skill-sets due to the services. Many specialized firms were considered during market research, however these firms did not demonstrate the man-power to mobilize at the speed and scale of which was required. Firms considered included Castlerock Environmental Inc., Argus Contracting LLC, LVI Environmental Services Group Inc., and Specialized Environmental, Inc. Conversations with LVI Environmental Services Group Inc. and Specialized Environmental, Inc. were conducted after preliminary market research. LVI Environmental Services Group Inc. stated that they could not meet our requirements. Specialized Environmental, Inc. stated that they felt they would be able to, and were provided an opportunity to take part in a job walk. Following the job walk, Specialized Environmental, Inc. indicated that they would be able to perform the work along with a subcontractor. American Technologies, Inc. was contacted and took part in a job walk. Following the job walk, a solicitation was issued to Specialized Environmental, Inc. Subsequently Specialized Environmental, Inc. indicated that they would not be able to perform the work. Due to the scale, complexity and urgency of the requirement, many of the firms contacted indicated that they would not be willing to take on such risk. Having completed the job walk, American Technologies, Inc. stated that they would be able to peform the work. American Technologies, Inc. was the one firm that was willing and capable of performing the work. A solicitation was issue to American Technologies, Inc.</p>
<p>Due to the urgency of this procurement, FAR 5.202 (2) does not require synopsizing the contract action on the FedBizOpps website.</p>
<p>6.DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>GSA has prepared an Independent Government Cost Estimate to assist in the establishment of a fair and reasonable price. Award will be made by determining, on the basis of the Government Cost Estimate, that the price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>7.DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET SURVEY CONDUCTED</p>
<p>The Construction Services Branch and Laguna Field Office provided names of contractors who had the skills necessary to perform the required work in the required timeframe. American Technologies, Inc. was the only firm they believed could meet these criteria.</p>
<p>8.OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Based upon the information provided in the above paragraph 5. Description Of Efforts To Solicit As Many Offers As Practicable, and given the fact that harm to the Government's property would have occurred from potential mold growth which would have led to possible shutdown and additional repair costs to the Government building. The Government's ability to perform its mission, and to provide a safe environment would have been hampered if the procurement was delayed. Due to this consideration, the only firm we believe could provide the construction services as required was American Technologies, Inc. (see also Attachment A - Technical Representative Certification)</p>
<p><br />9.LIST OF SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION<br /><br />Specialized Environmental (declined to <br />submit an offer; job too large)<br />7431 Walnut Avenue.<br />Buena Park, CA 90620-1761<br />American Technologies, Inc.<br />210 W Baywood Ave.<br />Orange, CA 92865-2603<br /><br />10.STATEMENT OF ACTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION</p>
<p>Given the unique and unusual circumstances of this situation, there are no actions that could be taken to remove or overcome the existing barriers to competition. The need to acquire the stated service in the manner proposed is due to the need for accomplishing the service in as short a period of time that is practical.</p>

<p>The "Emergency ACM Abatement and Dehumidification of First and Second Floor" should be accomplished as soon as possible because of the scale of tenants that have their operations affected, and escalating risks to the building envelope due to mold concerns. One contractor has been determined to be qualified to perform the scope of work under the project. Due to the urgency of the work to be accomplished, traditional procurement procedures must be bypassed in favor of emergency procurement methods. It is therefore recommended the project be solicited on an emergency basis and the request for proposals be limited to the one contractor listed above.</p>
<p>I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>For signatures, see attached PDF file.&nbsp;</p>
