<DESC>**** This&nbsp;notice was inadvertely posted under the heading "Special Notice" on 6 March 2014.&nbsp; That posting has since been archieved.&nbsp; Please refer to this Pre-Solicitation for FA8751-14-R-0016 Enterprise Software License Agreement TRAX 1.0****<br /><br />This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1). This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a size standard of $35.5 million average annual receipts.
<p>AFRL requires the purchase of a software toolset to bridge their communications with current data-link software technology. The proposed contract type is Firm Fixed Price for a perpetual enterprise software license agreement allowing an unlimited number of copies/installations to AFRL. The software package needs to bridge incompatible operational waveforms LINK-16 and Situational Awareness Data Link [SADL] and provide interoperability between different data formats to include LINK-16 J-Messages, Cursor on Target [COT], Keyhole Markup Language [KML], Key Length Value [KLV] while providing user friendly operation to tactical users.</p>
<p>Required Capabilities:</p>
<p>&bull; Host Platform J Link-16 radios <br />&bull; Host SADL radios <br />&bull; Enable J-Message text chat<br />&bull; Provide interoperability and forwarding between datalinks<br />&bull; Contain an easily transferrable SA Mode database <br />&bull; Utilize an intuitive user interface<br />&bull; Perform JREAPC client functions<br />&bull; Provide the ability to connect directly to SA Mode radios<br />&bull; Provide the ability to organize received data</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract to for a perpetual enterprise license agreement for TRAX 1.0 software. The software producer is:</p>
<p>Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC)<br />18635 Jarkey Drive<br />Hagerstown, ND 21742</p>
<p><br />The government has determined no other company's software offers an all-in-one communications bridging solution, operable by the tactical user. Alternatives do not offer the intuitiveness of TRAX, and are not easily configured in the field; alternatives require in-depth knowledge of actual waveforms for configuration, which may be beyond the training of the end user, who simply requires communications interoperability.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Bryant.Soule@us.af.mil Responses to this notice must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 1 April 2014.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>Note: Solicitation number W52P1J-10-R-0182 is being replaced by Solicitation number W52P1J-14-R-0005  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI), Rock Island Arsenal, IL, on behalf of the Office of Project Manager - Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS), intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement of the 105mm Projectile Gun Unit (PGU)-43/B Training Cartridge, PGU-44/B High Explosive (HE) Cartridge, and the PGU-45/B High Fragmentation (HF) Cartridge. This effort is for the Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) of these three cartridges for the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) for the AC-130 Gunship training and tactical missions.  <br>  <br> The CTG Artillery (ARTY) 105mm Training and Practice PGU-43/B Cartridge, DODIC CA22, NIIN 01-472-1854 is the AFSOC designation for the 105mm Inert Cartridge with Supplementary charge. It is made by taking an old stock Army M1 projectile, removing the Comp-B fill from the projectile body, refilling the projectile with inert filler, cavity drill and installation of a fuze well cup and reinstalling the TNT supplementary charge.  The projectile is mated with a CYU-1B brass cartridge case (same cartridge case as the Army M14) containing the M28A2 percussion primer and the M67 propelling charge. The round is fitted with a M739A1 or the M557 fuze depending on fuze availability.  LAP of the round requires crimping the cartridge case to the projectile and packaging into PA71/A containers which are then placed in a wire-bound box that holds 39 PGU-43/B cartridges. <br>  <br> The CTG ARTY 105mm HE PGU-44/B Cartridge, DODIC CA34, NIIN 01-515-9269 is the AFSOC designation for the 105mm Cartridge (similar to the Army 105mm HE M1 (MOD) Cartridge).  It consists of a refurbished Army M1 projectile body that is filled with approximately 5 lbs of Comp-B explosive, TNT Supplementary Charge, CYU-1/B brass cartridge case containing the M28A2 percussion primer and the M67 Propellant charge.  The round is fitted with an FMU-153/B fuze.  LAP of the round requires 200 percent x-ray inspection of the fill, crimping the cartridge case to the projectile and packaging into PA71/A containers which are then placed in the wire-bound box that holds 39 PGU-44/B cartridges. <br>  <br> The CTG ARTY 105mm, HF, HE PGU-45/B Cartridge without Fuze, DODIC CA33, NIIN 01-514-8595 is the AFSOC designation for the 105mm HF, HE Cartridge. It consists of a HF projectile body that is filled with approximately 5 lbs of Comp-B explosive, TNT Supplementary Charge, CYU-1/B brass cartridge case containing the M28A2 percussion primer, and the M67 Propellant Charge.  LAP of the round requires crimping the cartridge case to the projectile and packaging into PA71/A containers which are then placed in the wire bound box that holds 39 PGU-45/B cartridges.  <br>  <br> Competition for this effort will be limited to the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB), within the United States and Canada, under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i), Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Developmental, or Research Capability; or Expert Services. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Priced (FFP) contract.  The solicitation is intended to result in the single award of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with four ordering periods covering FY12-FY17 requirements.  Award will be made to the best overall proposal, which is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.  Each offeror will be evaluated against the solicitation criteria to determine if the offeror has the technical expertise, equipment, and personnel required to manufacture and manage the product in accordance with the solicitation requirements and delivery schedule as delineated in Section F of the solicitation.  The Technical Data Package (TDP) is available for this acquisition.  The Point of Contract for this notification and any requests/questions may be directed to Chet A. Jacks at chet.a.jacks.civ@mail.mil.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. <br>

<ARCHDATE>04212014
<CONTACT>Rebecca S Mullenax, Phone 304-285-5880, Fax 304-285-6083, Email rmullenax@cdc.gov - James Ambrozic, Purchasing Agent, Phone 412-386-6690, Email jambrozic@cdc.gov
<DESC>Title: Sleep Deprivation System <br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Pinnacle Technology, Inc. 2721 Oregon Street, Lawrence, KS 66046 to provide twelve (12) Part # 9000-K6-S automatic sleep deprivation systems for rats.<br /><br />Background<br />We are currently conducting a study of the effects of sleep deprivation and disruption on stroke in rats. This is to elucidate the mechanisms of stroke likelihood and outcome for shift workers. It has been reported that shift workers have a greater incidence of stroke and a poorer recovery from their strokes than day time workers. Briefly, rats are subjected to either sleep disruption by being shook periodically through their sleep cycle or sleep deprivation by gently handling when signs of sleep are observed. Next they are subjected to a surgically placed blood clot to mimic an embolic stroke. Lastly they are sacrificed and their brains are examined to see the effects of sleep disruption and deprivation on the resultant brain damage.<br /><br />Project Objective<br />The objective is to generate sleep deprived or sleep disrupted rats for surgical stroke placement and manipulation. The project total is for 500 rats so we will need several sleep deprivation systems to run simultaneously. Animals will have their sleep disrupted or deprived for 8 hours after the initiation of their normal sleep cycle for 11 consecutive days before they are subjected to surgical stroke. After surveying the post stroke rat brains hopefully the effect of sleep deprivation versus sleep fragmentation on stroke can be determined and eventually used to design effective interventions for the cerebral vascular health of shift workers.<br /><br />Statement of Work<br />We require a system that can be run in stand-alone configuration. This allows each unit to operate under different specifications and also negates the need for a computer if one is not available. This stand-alone operation will be used for the sleep disruption part of the experiment. A chamber arm will sweep the chamber, thus waking the rodent, at investigator determined intervals. We also require units that can perform automated sleep deprivation. The Pinnacle Technology system contains an EEG/EMG rat system for sleep. This system detects the rat's brain waves to determine the stage of sleep or level or wakefulness. The system will be used to detect signs of sleep and then the chamber will automatically sweep and wake the animal up. This system will also provide documentation of the rat's wakefulness throughout the experiment. Since it doesn't require direct handling, like the gentle handing method, more rats will be able to be experimentally manipulated at each time. The system needs a 12" X 12" circular diameter with a water bottle and food hopper to allow free feeding during the experiment. It will require a conditioning and acquisition system for the EEG/EMG data as well as a preamplifier.<br /><br />This contract action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) and 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. <br />The notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be e-mailed to purchasing agent Rebecca Mullenax at rmullenax@cdc.gov by COB on March 21, 2014.<br />FAR Reference: FAR 5.207 - Preparation and transmittal of synopses under (c) (15), (c) (16) (i) <br />

<DESC>I.  Introduction/Purpose

This announcement provides a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Market Survey for the Aerospace Medicine Safety Information System (AMSIS). The purpose of this market survey is to: 

1) Seek market interest and gain knowledge of potential approaches for meeting AMSIS system functionality;
2) Collect market information on functions available for uploading, processing data, maintaining and storing data that contains personal health information and data security; 
3) Collect information on the feasibility to  leverage external government systems; 
4) Collect market information on technology that allows for monitoring of industry drug and alcohol testing programs and management of internal substance abuse programs;
5) Collect information on best practices to achieve the AMSIS Concept of Operations; and
6) Collect information regarding business process management systems and approaches for implementing functionality into AMSIS.

II. Background

The FAA Office of Aerospace Medicine (AAM) is responsible for a broad range of medical programs and services for both the domestic and international aviation communities. AAM is responsible for advancing the field of study of aerospace medicine and for the medical certification programs and medical surveillance of airmen, Air Traffic Control specialists (ATCS), and other safety critical personnel.  The AAM Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) maintains records on over 450,000 medical certifications conducted each year out of approximately 600,000 active airmen and nearly 17,000 ATCS.  CAMI records total 18,000,000 past medical examinations for airmen and ATCS as part of AAMâ€™s oversight role.  The surveillance program for the Drug Abatement Division (AAM-800) oversees 8,097 certificated entities, the Department of Transportation (DOT) administered Internal Substance Abuse Program (ISAP) oversees all FAA employees through random drug testing, and the Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) program surveys approximately 4,250 AMEs both domestically and internationally.  AAM is responsible for the following safety critical medical initiatives:

â€¢	Airmen Medical Certification;
â€¢	Medical Clearance of Air Traffic Control Specialists (ATCS); 
â€¢	Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) Program;
â€¢	Aviation Industry Substance Abuse Program;
â€¢	Employee Substance Abuse Program;


III. Description 

AMSIS will provide an aerospace medical information network that integrates critical and security sensitive medical information generated from geographically distributed locations nationally and internationally.  AMSIS critical data may be used for regulatory enforcement purposes in addition to interfacing with a variety of agency mission related databases.   AMSIS will provide new information systems architecture; design, procure and deploy next generation information systems.  The program objectives include providing tools necessary for AAM to analyze information to make risk-based policy decisions utilizing automated data processing for the collection/storage, review, and analysis of sensitive medical information for Airmen and ATCS.

This system will improve the processes for comprehensive access to data, thereby improving timeliness and accuracy (such as e-authentication) while reducing paper based correspondence.  It will also enable collaboration within the aviation community, both domestic and international, as well as among properly authorized personnel, designees, and applicants. Data access will be through secured methods that are easily accessible without compromising data security, while enabling appropriately authorized government personnel to access the information for decision making.   AMSIS will provide improved data collection and access to pilot and ATCS info for a proactive safety approach resulting in improved productivity. 

IV. Nature of Competition

The acquisition strategy for the anticipated procurement has not been determined at this time. The results of the market survey will assist the FAA in developing an acquisition approach that may include inter-governmental resources and/or competitive processes utilizing full and open, small business or other socio-economic designation set-aside options.

<CONTACT>Marcelle Loveday, Phone 2026463859, Email marcelle.loveday@fema.dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security/ Federal Emergency Management Agency/Office of External Affairs (DHS/ FEMA/OEA) Ready Campaign Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (in accordance with FAR 6.302) with the Ad Council, located at 1707 L Street NW, Ste. 600 Washington, DC 20036.<br />The Ready Campaign has a requirement for public service advertising (PSA) campaign support to educate and encourage Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies whether natural or man-made. The proposed action is for services for which Government intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />The mission of the Ready Campaign is to serve as FEMA's national preparedness campaign to create national public service advertising (PSA) campaigns designed to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. The goal of the Campaign is to get the public involved and ultimately to increase the level of basic preparedness across the nation and more specifically to inform the public about the different types of emergencies that can happen and the appropriate responses. Ultimately the Campaign intends to prompt Americans to do three things: get an emergency supply kit, make a plan, and be informed about the different emergencies and the appropriate responses to them. By engaging Americans on these three simple steps, Ready hopes that this will free up valuable response resources when an emergency occurs and ultimately increase the level of basic preparedness across the nation. Additionally; Ready utilizes public outreach and other efforts to not only encourage individuals and families but to also encourage owners and managers of small and medium sized business in America to take steps to prepare their businesses for emergencies. These include; planning to stay in business, talking to their employees; and protect their investment; encourage parents and teachers in America to educate children about emergencies and the role they can play in helping to get their families prepared; and to encourage state and local governments to create localized efforts to encourage their residents to prepare for emergencies and educate them on local threats and plans.
<p>The Ready Campaign must have the ability to reach all Americans through many different mechanisms with a clear and simple message. Therefore, the campaign requires specialized services from an organization that can create and develop public service messages and advertisements that are strategically sound and relevant to the audience; have an established network in place and history of strong relationships with advertisers, media, and public service directors, and media organizations to get these public service advertisements placed in donated media space (this is customary for public service messages); have ability and capacity to work with state and local governments to allow them to tag these national advertisements with their own local logo and assist them in garnering donated media space in their state or community; have ability to tap into top talent in the advertising, social marketing, and communications fields to help in the creation and development of new messages and advertisements in a voluntary capacity; and have the ability to conduct research on Americans attitudes and behaviors on emergency preparedness.</p>
<p>The services to be provided under this contract include:<br />&bull; Market Research, Media Analysis, and Related Services<br />&bull; Public Service Advertising<br />&bull; Track the Use of the Ready Campaign's PSAs<br />&bull; Materials Development<br />&bull; Partnership Development and Opportunities<br />&bull; Media and Public Relations Services</p>
<p>The requirement is to:<br />&#61607; Distribute the Ready Campaign's messages through existing public service advertisements -The Campaign's existing television, radio, print, outdoor, and internet public service advertisements need to be renewed and continue to be distributed to media outlets across the nation until they expire.</p>
<p>&#61607; Distribute the Ready Campaign's message through new public service advertisements- New television, radio, print, outdoor, and internet public service advertisements need to be researched, developed, produced, and distributed to media outlets across the country. This includes new public service advertisements for general market, Hispanic market, business market, families with children, and other segments of the population as needed. It also includes ads that can be localized by state and local governments.</p>
<p>&#61607; Create and Develop new public service advertisements- The Ready Campaign's public service advertisements are created and developed on a cycle basis of approximately two years. Therefore, the contractor will need to be responsible for the development and creation of new public service advertisements and have the ability to tap the expertise of leading advertising, media, and communications professionals on a volunteer basis.</p>
<p>&#61607; Track the use of the Ready Campaign's public service advertisements- All of the Ready Campaign's television, radio, print, outdoor, and internet PSAs need to be tracked to see when, and how often they are aired and how much donated media space they are receiving.</p>
<p>&#61607; Conduct Annual Tracking Studies to measure the Campaign's progress- Studies need to be conducted each year to see how the general market, Hispanic Market, business market, families with children and other segments of the population are receiving Ready's messages and if they have taken steps to prepare.</p>
<p>&#61607; Distribute the Ready Campaign's messages through media outreach and public relations efforts- Conduct media outreach efforts to promote the Campaign including Satellite and Radio Media Tours and other activities. This includes media outreach efforts around National Preparedness Month, Resolve to be Ready, the "Teachable Moments" leading up to and after an emergency occurs and other news worthy events.</p>
<p>&#61607; Distribute the Ready Campaign's messages through partnerships- Develop relationships with a wide variety of public and private sector as well as media and non-media organizations to distribute the Campaign's message.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement is a base period of twelve months and four (4) twelve month option periods.<br /><br />The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) determined that the Ad Council is uniquely qualified to perform this work. This contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15.<br /><br />This notice of intent is NOT a request for proposals (RFP) for competitive quotes/proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.

	EPA has identified Aerodyne Research, Inc. as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement.  The nature of this acquisition reqires a contractor that possesses the unique capability of delivering a low-flow thermal denuder compatible with the BC (Black Carbon) monitoring system that the EPA has on-site.  The BC monitoring system consists of a nephelometer, photoacoustic spectrometer (PA), and single particle soot photometer(SP2). These instruments are typically field deployed simultaneously in support of carbonaceous aerosol characterization.  Aerodyne is the only company that designs, builds, and markets low-flow thermal denuders that will meet our minimum specifications based on the market survey we conducted. 
	The thermal denuder and its fittings shall be compatible with a single particle photometer and photoacoustic spectroscopy BC monitoring system (Swagelock compression fittings). It shall be delivered with an automatic flow valve system that will allow thermal denuder bypass. The thermal denuder and valve system shall have USB compatibility and basic PC software control of electronics for temperature and sample flow. This shall be accomplished through a signal distribution box or similar. The thermal denuder shall have multiple heating zones capable of reaching at least 250 degrees Celsius continuously. The thermal denuder shall be temperature programmable over the range of (35-250 degrees Celsius). The denuder material shall be a swappable bed of activated carbon or similar material with high adsorbing capacity for volatilized organic gases. The sample flow rate shall be 1 L/min as to be compatible with current EPA monitoring instrumentation. The denuder system shall be field  deployable at less than 20 lbs and shall include a 110V AC module. 
Any firm that is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as set forth above may submit a response; which, if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration.  Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via email only.  A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any responses or comments should be directed via email to Kimberly Loesch at loesch.kimberly@epa.gov.  One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements.  EPA anticipates that award will be made by April 11, 2014.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), intends to issue a sole source award for the completing and finalizing the development and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) validation of the RPS FebriDx Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) in support of the DHS Directorate of Science and Technology, Chemical and Biological Defense Division (CBD) to Rapid Pathogen Screening (RPS) Inc., 7727 Delainey Court, Sarasota, FL 34240-8440.
<p>The work to be performed will involve the continued development, test, evaluation, and final completion of the current prototype assay and will be used in triage for rapidly screening patients infected (symptomatic), as well as provide comfort to those who may believe they potentially have been exposed (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and who may need post-exposure prophylaxis. The RPS FebriDx LFA will mitigate the consequence of biological incidents through early detection and complement the Government's "detect-to-treat" approach by providing a new capability to DHS and its stakeholders that not only rapidly and accurately diagnoses patients at the point of care, but buys precious time for the delivery of requisite medical countermeasures. Therefore, this requested action to continue support to develop, test, evaluate, and complete the current prototype assay will ensure continuity of the Government's ability to mitigate the consequence of biological incidents.<br /><br />The services to be provided for this proposed sole source action will also offer a solution for the widespread over use of antibiotics (and the resulting increase in antibiotic resistance), and will significantly mitigate the current costs associated with making an accurate diagnosis so that effective treatment can be administered.</p>
<p>Note 22: This pre-award synopsis is for informational purposes only. Technical proposals will not be considered, however technical capability statements may be submitted, only if your organization has the technical capabilities necessary to meet the above stated needs. If such documents are submitted, they may be reviewed for consideration to open this requirement up for competition. The determination to open up the requirement to competition is at the sole discretion of the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.<br />&emsp;</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Deloitte Consulting LLP, 1725 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314.  This contract will require Deloitte to complete key developmental updates of the NMCI Enterprise Tool for Transition (NET-T) required for the transition from the Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC) to the Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) contract.  NET-T is the sole system that provides the Task Order creation capability for ordering services under the CoSC and NGEN as well as the single entry point for requesting delivery to Department of the Navy (DON) users. Deloitte is the only agent currently performing design, development and implementation of updates to NET-T.  Failure to complete transition to NGEN contract, consolidate certain systems into NET-T (eMP and SReForm), and integrate with Wide Area Workflow would result in significant financial harm to the DON. This new contract with Deloitte Consulting LLP will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract with a base year and one (1) option year. This effort is inextricably linked to work already being performed by Deloitte Consulting LLP.
An Award Notice will be publicized, when applicable, along with the supporting Justification and Approval (J&A) for the Other than Full and Open Competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 5.201, 5.303, and 6.305 under separate notice.  The Government is not soliciting proposals in response to this synopsis. However, since it is the policy of the Government to foster competition, any prospective offeror may provide information, which the Government will consider in its continued review of the sole-source nature of the requirement. The solicitation will be issued without further notice.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems.
<p>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP website at <em>www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions</em>. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP website no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 8, 2013. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.</p>
<p>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.</p>
<p>There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $8.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.</p>
<p><br />Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit research pre-proposals for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by SERDP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether SERDP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, SERDP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above.</p>
<p>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees and $4.5M respectively. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The HECSA Small Business Office website at <em>www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb</em> provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.</p>

ACC has a continuing need for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and supported equipment. USAGAPG is the host activity for over 80 tenant activities and, as such, is responsible for providing security assistance to include IDS design, installation, and maintenance. IDS is an integral part of the overall security posture for APG and Tenant Activities that have very unique facilities that require specific means of protection. <br> ACC must provide Security Systems to Tenant Activities to include equipment, delivery, installation, and maintenance of new and existing security devices/systems. The Garrison in conjunction with Tenant Activities identifies areas in which systems are needed or need to be upgraded to ensure the appropriate regulations are followed. This system support includes providing technical assistance and training in the operation, and testing of the systems and related equipment. Provide and install interior intrusion detection systems complete with sensors, control units, battery back-up power supplies, and cable and communications line supervision as required. The current control units are the Focus 200 Alarm Panel and keypad. This panel communicates specifically with communication receiving equipment installed on APG.  Aberdeen Proving Ground is approved to use this panel by Department of the Army, Office of the Provost Marshall General versus the Army Standard Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS).   <br> Performance Work Statement (PWS):  see document attached to this notice. The Statement of Work (SOW) has been changed and updated since last posted on AFSI and is now referred to as a PWS. <br>  <br> All capability statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Kathleen O'Mara, Contract Specialist <br> kathleen.e.omara.civ@mail.mil in MS Word by 2PM (EST) on 11 March 2014.

<p>b. The microscope should be capable of using all slide platforms, including membrane and non-membrane slides, frame slides, charged slides, uncharged slides and dishes.</p>
<p>c. The microscope should be capable of selecting multiple objects from the same field-of-view, and catapult objects quickly and those sequentially as assigned to a single cap or multiple caps.</p>
<p>d. The system should be capable of achieving a laser cutting resolution of less than 1 micron with a 100x objective, making single cell and some sub-cellular dissections possible.<br /><br />e. The microscope should be used to conduct all standard LCM applications, including paraffin fixed, cryo-section of live cells, fluorescence, and archived slides.</p>
<p>f. The microscope should have a full range of long working distance objectives from 5x to 150x (5x, 10x, 20x, 40x, 63x, 100x, and 150x).</p>
<p>g. The microscope should have a confocal apparatus to enhance the LCM system value and to increase operational flexibility.</p>
<p>h. The microscope should employ the Laser Pressure Catapulting technology to provide 'True' non-contact operation, thereby yielding high capture efficiency and reducing cross contamination.</p>
<p>i. The PC Workstation should have minimum 2 TB RAID HD, Memory expandable to 128 GB RAM, and one (1) GB Graphics Card.</p>
<p>j. Technical support, service and application support should be readily available upon request.</p>
<p><br />3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SYSTEM ACCESSORIES<br /></span>The LCMM should be easily upgraded for the following capabilities/features:<br /><br />a. Can be configured to be used with bright-field, phase, and plas DIC<br /><br />b. Can be configured for high through-put operation to expedite the capture of large numbers of samples<br /><br />c. A modularly designed system that can be easily upgraded to prevent obsolescence<br /><br />d. Other imaging platforms can be added/upgraded for increased functionality, including research grade imaging cameras and tweezers operation<br /><br />e. The system should be upgradeable to perform laser microinjection of living cells<br /><br />f. The system should be upgradeable to be capable of living cell microsurgery and retrieval of cells from tissue cultures</p>

<p>The SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic - New Orleans Office is seeking information for potential sources for assistance in the migration of the SEMS system (both database and middleware) to newer releases when required for Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), Functional Area Manager (FAM), or Department of the Navy (DoN) Application and Database Management System (DADMS) compliance and sources that will provide the support required to sustain the current SEMS System environment (both application and database) during the transition. Support will consist of monitoring SEMS performance to identify potential problems, reviewing data dumps and recommending corrective action, and providing technical advice to SPAWARSYSCEN personnel relating to Oracle Fusion Middleware and Database software support.</p>
<strong>
<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>
</strong>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY 2</p>
<p>INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<strong>
<p>CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
</strong>
<p>Contract Number: ENCORE II - HC102808D2027/Order # 0007</p>
<p>Contract Type: FFP</p>
<p>Incumbent and their size: Unisys Corporation; LB</p>
<p>Method of previous acquisition: fair opportunity competition</p>
<p>Brief description of the current program/effort:</p>
<p>Support Equipment Management System (SEMS) is the umbrella system name for two related but distinct systems: 1) the Support Equipment Resources Management Information System (SERMIS); 2) the Automated Support Equipment Recommendation Data (AUTOSERD). The SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic, New Orleans Office operates SERMIS and the overall SEMS system. The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst located in Lakehurst, New Jersey manages AUTOSERD.</p>
<p>SERMIS is an Automated Data Processing system designed to assist Aircraft Maintenance Material Readiness List (AMMRL) program management in determining and establishing aviation allowance requirements for support equipment (SE) at activities performing organizational, intermediate or depot level maintenance. It also provides other capabilities: 1) standard inventory control procedures; 2) assistance in the redistribution of in-use SE assets; 3) provision of a base for budgeting requirements; 4) tools for scheduling and tracking SE items through depot rework; 5) identification of SE excesses and deficits by activity; and 6) assistance in measuring material readiness. The database is a complex system currently operating in a production environment at SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic - New Orleans Office in New Orleans, LA. It is comprised of seven subsystems and approximately 637 forms, on-line reports, batch reports, procedures, packages, and scripts.</p>
<p>The SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic - New Orleans Office provides information systems/automated data processing (IS/ADP) and data communications services to Department of Navy (DoN) and other Department of Defense (DoD) and federal Government activities. SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic - New Orleans Office provides technical services using both Government and contractor personnel on a reimbursement basis for regional data processing and communications support; design, development and maintenance of standard Navy automated systems; and other functions and tasks as directed by higher authority. During the past years, the customer base and workload at SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic - New Orleans Office has increased significantly. The increased database and network security mandated by the Navy is the primary reasons for this workload increase. Additionally, the design and implementation for network modernization has added to the overall workload. SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic - New Orleans Office is committed to improve the services we offer our customers and this was demonstrated by moving to a secured Web Enabled environment which provides a more flexible, cost-efficient computing base (infrastructure) and a more secure database for 3</p>
<p>customer applications. This infrastructure, as well as all supporting services will be developed in accordance with the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Master Plan. Unisys has been an active partner in the SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic - New Orleans Office migration effort since 1995. Unisys has provided DBA services starting with the migration from a legacy mainframe system to the client/server environment and in the ONGOING transition of the system to a secured web based system in compliance with the recent CNO Web Enabled Mandate. Additionally the DBA services provided have aided SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic - New Orleans Office's effort to receive Authority to Operate (ATO) for the SEMS system.</p>
<p>Anticipated Time Frame: The period of performance (PoP) is 366 calendar days plus four (4) option periods.</p>
<p>Place of Performance: SPAWARSYSCEN ATLANTIC - New Orleans, LA</p>
<strong>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>
</strong>

DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL in response to this request for information.
The objective of this requirement is to implement a professional nursing practice model of care that provides a comprehensive framework and care delivery system that focuses on three key relationships:  ourselves as caregivers, fellow colleagues, and compassionate therapeutic relationships with Veterans and their significant others.  Such a nursing practice model of care will provide a collaborative foundation and care delivery system based on caring sciences that establishes holistic Veteran-centered care.  Essential to the nursing practice model is the integration of Shared Governance structure and evidence based practice.  The nursing practice model will improve the quality of care and satisfaction of Veterans seeking care and that of those who provide care.  
The Nurse Executives of VISN 11 VA Medical Centers are striving to improve patient care outcomes, patient satisfaction, patient education as well as employee morale and satisfaction throughout Nursing Services and programs that involve nursing staff.  The services requested are required to assist the facilities in implementing evidence based professional nursing practice and a supportive care delivery model that is in alignment with VHA's strategic goals.  This training will assist the facilities in implementing evidence based professional nursing practice and a supportive care delivery model that is in alignment with VHA's strategic goals.

<CONTACT>Linda Walker, Deputy / Director of Business Operations, Phone 660-687-3641, Fax 660-687-4822, Email linda.walker.2@us.af.mil
<DESC>Because of an unforeseen $5,000,000 increase in FY14 Operations &amp; Maintenance funding, this serves as a Notice of Intent to increase the Whiteman AFB SABER contract ceiling (contract number FA4625-10-D-0003) from $40M to $45M. SABER was competitively awarded in June of 2010 to the Infinite Energy Construction (IEC) Company, under the Small Business Administration 8(a) Business Development Program. The contract included one base year and four option years. It is in the best interest of the Government to minimize project funding risks by increasing the existing SABER ceiling 12.5% (or $5M), so that the agency can execute several FY13-designed/FY14 planned tasks.<br /><br />The SABER contract has a contract ceiling of $40,000,000 over a five-year period. The contract currently has less than $8,000,000 of ceiling with 15 months remaining under the original ordering period. This original ordering period of the contract with options expires 31 May 2015 and will not be extended. Due to high demand of the construction services under this contract, capacity will soon be reached. The intent of this action is to increase the contract ceiling in order to allow adequate time to follow-on contract to be competed without interrupting the agency's mission to support these activities. Based on the projections of upcoming projects, an increase of $5,000,000 is required. This increase is to cover within scope changes and to perform existing and planned tasks until the new procurement is awarded, anticipated for 01 Oct 2014. The 509th Contracting Squadron is currently in the acquisition process to award a follow on contract via the competitive 8(a) process. All required specifications are being prepared and reviewed.<br />&nbsp;<br />If the capacity increase is not approved, a lapse in performance of task orders will occur, resulting in delays in providing operational facilities and failure to adequately support the mission at Whiteman AFB. It is also important to note that several of the projects referenced below were FY13 designed and negotiated under the current contract. Should the increased capacity not be approved, these specific projects will need to be redesigned which would result in additional cost to taxpayers and delays in providing operational facilities. The main projects to be awarded under the SABER contract, based on approved capacity, are: Repair Exterior/Interior of Building 1117, Renovate Hangar B52, Repair Degraded Sewer Lines - Phase I, Repair Electrical Bus Components at B-2 Docks 1-14, and Repair HVAC for Mold Mitigation Challenger Dorm.<br />&nbsp;<br />Due to task orders awarded in FY13 and prior years, the IDIQ is at or near exhaustion of capacity prior to expiration of the performance period, 31 May 2015. Additional capacity is requested to award task orders as well as to support any unforeseen mandatory contract modifications on existing FY13 and FY14 task orders. Approval through proper Air Force channels to increase the capacity on the SABER contract will be obtained.<br />&nbsp;<br />This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action. All information received within the 15 days will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br />

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of specialized lenses and associated attachments for use with a KEYENCE KHX-700FE Digital Microscope Viewing System utilized by the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory (LSEL). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334516. Size standard is 500 employees. <br />The proposed source is Government Scientific Source, Inc. 12351 Sunrise Valley Drive Reston, Virginia 20191. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The LSEL acquired a KEYENCE KDH-700FE Digital Microscope Imaging System requires these additional lenses and attachments to recognize the full inspection capabilities of this system. The KDH-700FE Digital Microscope is manufactured by KEYENCE Corporation of America and no other manufacturer can provide these lenses and associated attachments. <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov<br />

<DESC>TO: All Potential Respondents
<p>Subject: Request for Information (RFI) for SMC Future Space System Architecture Concept</p>
<p>1. Background. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Development Planning Directorate (XR) is responsible for developmental planning, concept development and architecture analysis for SMC programs, with particular emphasis on identifying cross-mission area concepts and synergies. XR seeks information on spacecraft bus options for future SMC systems that significantly reduce overall acquisition costs by acquiring very similar or identical spacecraft buses to host payloads for a variety of missions. This Request for Information (RFI) explains the information sought, reply due date and format. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract or future study based on this request for information.</p>
<p>2. Standard Spacecraft Bus Capabilities</p>
<p>Bus/mission: The spacecraft bus sought shall be designed to minimize non-recurring engineering cost and assembly, integration and test costs. In particular, the Government is interested in using modular, open and networked architectures (MONA) for the interface between the bus and the payloads. (Reference material provided at MONA/SNAP Industry Workshop 21 January, 2014.) Designs that use MONA within the bus are highly desired. The spacecraft bus sought shall be identical or have minimal production variation to support the effort required to host mission payloads. Some payloads of interest are 1) Overhead Persistence IR sensor (OPIR); 2) Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT); 3) Protected Communications (PCOM); and 4) Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS). It is anticipated each bus would host an OPIR payload, or a PCOM payload, or a PNT and NDS payload at a time. All buses would include space situational awareness payloads. Support to other AFSPC or Government payloads is desirable. Approximate payload accommodations are: 1) mass: less than 1500 pounds; 2) Bus deck dimensions: less than 12 square feet; 3) End of life power: less than 3,500 watts; 4) Pointing accuracy/stability: pointing accuracy is the same as the on-board attitude knowledge, &lt;0.5 arcseconds (1&sigma; radial rms) with a stability of &lt;0.1 arcseconds (1&sigma; radial rms over 200 sec).</p>
<p>Orbits: The spacecraft bus should support the following orbits: 1) Medium earth orbit (MEO) of approximately 20,000 km, 55 degrees inclination; 2) Geosynchronous orbit (GEO); 3) Up to 20 degrees inclined geosynchronous orbit (GIO); 4) Super synchronous circular orbit (SSGEO) with radius of about 80,000 km, 5) Molniya orbits apogee of about 45,000 km. In order to support operationally responsive constellations, the Government is interested in the ability to rapidly reposition satellite buses to alternate orbital slots.</p>
<p>Launch: The spacecraft shall be compatible with existing US government and commercially available launch vehicles. An objective is for at least two satellites to be manifested on each launch vehicle for lower launch costs.</p>
<p>Bus-payload compatibility: Government is interested in a MONA standard; is not interested in complex or multiple bus standards. Industry comment on approaches to integrate payloads into a common block buy of buses from a vendor is desired.</p>
<p>Nuclear hardening: The Government is interested in a bus that is unhardened, or a bus that is nuclear hardened per CJCSI 6811.01B, CJCSI 6210.02B and CJCSI 3222.01A. The Government is interested in the cost impact of these CJCS requirements.</p>
<p>3. Acquisition Strategy. The operational period of interest is 2020 to 2040. As many as 55 satellites may be operational at a time, with approximately 35 in MEO and the remainder in a variety of GEO, IGEO, SSGEO or Molniya. The Government is considering procuring the spacecraft in block contracts from potentially multiple vendors to ensure an available and competitive industrial base. Although the Government does not intend to award a contract at this time, the government seeks suggestions for the most cost effective acquisition process that supports this strategy.</p>
<p>4. Cost estimate. The Government seeks suggestions on how to minimize the life cycle cost for utilizing a standard spacecraft bus to accomplish multiple missions.</p>
<p>5. RFI response. Each responder is asked to include the following:</p>
<p>A. Responder Information: The responder will include company name, organization, author's name, email and phone contact information in their response.</p>
<p>B. Standard Spacecraft Bus Feasibility Assessment: The responder will include a feasibility assessment of the standard bus concept, include benefits and disadvantage. Describe if the Government's needs could be meet, include approach to minimum risk and cost.</p>
<p>C. Approach for Providing Standard Spacecraft Bus Features: Describe how the provider would design, development, test and evaluate each subsystem of the standard spacecraft bus.</p>
<p>D. Approach for Payload Interfacing Risk Mitigation: Describe how the provider would minimize the integration risks for the different payloads to be accommodated.</p>
<p>E. Approach for Launch Vehicle Compatibility: Describe how the provider would ensure dual manifesting on USG or commercial space lift rocket.</p>
<p>F. Approach to Provide Quantities Needed: Describe how the provider would provide the mission capabilities for the period of interest (2020-2040).</p>
<p>G. Acquisition Approach: Provide recommendation for most cost effective acquisition approach. Describe feasibility of two source (primary and secondary) spacecraft bus acquisition. Discuss block buy strategy. Describe positive and negative aspects.</p>
<p>H. Cost Estimate: Provide a rough order of magnitude estimate for: 1) Non-recurring design, modification, and development cost. 2) First unit production cost. 3) Learning curve assumptions. 4) Notional schedule: PDR, CDR, production/IAT, delivery. 5) TRL levels and heritage to existing product line. 6) Nuclear radiation hardening (there is no page limit for this section of the response).</p>
<p>6. RFI response format and due date:</p>
<p>A. All responses should be accomplished on company letterhead.<br />B. File format: PDF, delivered softcopy as described below.<br />C. Page: 8.5 x 11 inch paper with 1 inch margins.<br />D. Style: 11 point, New Times Roman font.<br />E. Page limit: 10 pages.<br />F. Page marking: Company proprietary material should be properly marked.<br />G. Due date: responses are due no later than (NLT) Thursday, 3 April 2014. Responses should be submitted electronically to Ms. Tiffany Trotter and Lt Garrett Ellis.<br />H. The program office welcomes any industry partner that would like to have 1-2 hour meeting (and/or telecon) to discuss their papers and/or thoughts. Please contact Lt Garrett Ellis to schedule a meeting if desired.</p>

<DESC><p>The Defense Health Agency intends to award a sole source contract to Technatomy Corporation, a small business under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii). The period of performance will be for a period of 4 months (April through August of 2014). This action is necessary to bridge the performance period between the end of VA assisted acquisition contract and the award of the new program management follow-on contract. The contract is needed to prevent a break in service, while the&nbsp;foundations and protocols&nbsp;for a new contract&nbsp;are developed. This sole source award will be a&nbsp;Firm Fixed Price contract.</p>
<p>These support services provided by the incumbent span the DHMS organization across an array of projects directly related to the DHMS acquisition and DOD/VA interoperability efforts. Services provided allow the Government to sustain the technical work required, as well as maintain overall program and project vigilance.</p>
<p>As the current prime program management contractor, Technatomy Corporation is considered the only contractor that can meet DHMS needs given the potentially short period of performance for the extension.</p>
<p>The contractor currently supports the implementation of information systems that support DoD-VA interoperability. It includes an available level of effort of approximately 136 FTEs that are deployed across DHMS programs. Support is provided to Program Managers to facilitate and ensure the proper integration support is provided to the various technical organizations and chartered projects within the overall program intra-organizational processes and governance structure. The contractor also provides support in coordinating deployment and cut-over activities across dependent Agency and legacy system organizations to ensure that new capabilities are deployed and legacy capabilities are retired with minimal impact on the DoD and VA clinical operations. <br /><br />The contractor has the experienced and skilled personnel already in place to provide continued and uninterrupted services at DHMS. Failure to continue and sustain support continuity will result in compromised ability by DHMS to meet it current operating capabilities.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All capability statements received within fifteen (15) calendar days after date of publication of this notice will be reviewed by the Government and considered. Statements must be received NLT 3pm EST. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Should your firm desire to submit a capability statement, it should demonstrate the Offeror's experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length. Written inquiries may be directed to Jake Lewis via email at jake.lewis@dha.mil.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to help the Department of Commerce (DOC) better understand current and future market solutions, availability of services, and industry best practices, related to procuring, migrating to, and managing cloud services. For the purposes of this RFI, the government defines a "cloud broker" vendor as an entity that manages the use, performance and delivery of cloud services, and negotiates relationships between Cloud Providers and Cloud Consumers.<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><span><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent to the receipt of responses to this RFI the DOC may invite select RFI respondents to a technical interchange session to discuss their response with Government representatives.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black">In today's budgetary environment, all government Departments must strive to spend taxpayer dollars as efficiently as possible. </span>The DOC, like other Departments, faces the challenge of providing important services and products to the American people while simultaneously reducing costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">The DOC is comprised of 12 Bureaus of varying sizes and diverse missions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Presently, most Bureaus independently manage their own business systems and IT infrastructure and services (including web site infrastructure and support).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bureaus are currently in various stages of migrating different services and business systems to the cloud, with many still evaluating the potential for cloud services for new and existing requirements.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">Senior leaders at DOC believe savings, service level improvements, and security enhancements can be achieved by 1) moving more systems and services to the cloud and 2) taking a more collaborative approach to procuring and managing Cloud Services across the Department. A broad initiative is underway with several near-term objectives:</p>

<DESC>This notice closes on March 24, 2014. <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Product Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers  (PM GCTT) has a requirement to procure additional spares for the Abrams M1A2 SEP Advanced Gunnery Training System (AGTS) devices.  The additional spares are necessary to maintain the 48 currently fielded M1A2 SEP V2 AGTS systems supported by PM GCTT.  The procurement will include commander's handles and 10 quote mark  LCD screen kits for use in replacing damaged components during maintenance of the systems. <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  A modification to the Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Contract W900KK-09-D-0314-0013 will be issued to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training (LM MST) under the PEO STRI Omnibus Contract II (STOC II).  Execution of the modification is projected for the third quarter of FY14.   <br>  <br> LM MST can successfully perform this effort as they possess the proprietary rights to the Technical Data Package and they possess extensive experience on all previous AGTS requirements.  Since upgrades and improvements will use the existing AGTS as a basis for the upgraded components, knowledge of the existing system is imperative in order to ensure a smooth transition between the current AGTS and the improved AGTS configuration.  Only LM MST can successfully perform the effort because the prime contractor alone possesses the required system technical data and knowledge needed to integrate subsystems effectively to meet user performance criteria.   <br>  <br> This Modification will be issued on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. quote mark   <br>  <br> ESTIMATED ACQUISITION DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $420K <br>  <br> PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  One (1) Year  <br>  <br> NOTICE:  This notice is being provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement given the technical data outlined above.  Interested sources shall submit its capabilities statement (no more than 10 pages) by 9:00 am EST on the closing date of this notice to the POCs listed below. Responses shall provide a description of the source's ability to meet the requirement and delivery schedules.  <br>  <br> DISCLAIMER:  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.

<p>v. Site Visit and Solicitation Questions. A pre-proposal conference is not scheduled for this site. However, upon request by an offeror, a site visit may be conducted where services are to be performed to identify any general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance. The offeror must notify the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer noted in paragraph i above (not the Communications Squadron representative or other government representative) of the site visit request by 21 March 2014. If a site visit is conducted, resulting questions and answers will be available to all potential offerors via the FBO.GOV website. Information provided at the site visit shall not alter the terms and conditions of the solicitation and specifications. Offerors shall submit any other questions relating to the solicitation to only the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer by 26 March 2014. Questions received after this date may potentially not be answered due to time constraints of the solicitation.</p>
<p>vi. Submit offer as follows:<br />DOCUMENT CONTENTS FILE FORMAT <br />Volume Three Pricing and Contracting PDF or .doc and .xls</p>
<p>2. Specific Instructions for Volume Three:<br />iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). <br />A. Contracting Information. <br />(1) Provide the signature block of the individual authorized to make an offer which includes individual's name, title, e-mail address and phone number.<br />(2) Provide cage code, data universal numbering system (DUNS) number, and tax identification number as registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). <br />(3) Organizational Representatives.

<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. - NOT REQUIRED</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>
<p>Additional provision which may not be online at SAM:<br />252.209-7993 Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law-Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations (DEVIATION 2014-O0009) Feb 2014<br />(a) In accordance with sections 8113 and 8114 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2014, and sections 414 and 415 of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Relating Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014 (Pub. L. 113-76, Divisions C and J), none of the funds made available by those divisions (including Military Construction Funds) may be used to enter into a contract with any corporation that-<br />(1) Has any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, where the awarding agency is aware of the unpaid tax liability, unless the agency has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and made a determination that this further action is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government; or <br />(2) Was convicted of a felony criminal violation under any Federal law within the preceding 24 months, where the awarding agency is aware of the conviction, unless the agency has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and made a determination that this action is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government.<br />(b) The Offeror represents that-<br />(1) It is [ ] is not [ ] a corporation that has any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability,<br />(2) It is [ ] is not [ ] a corporation that was convicted of a felony criminal violation under a Federal law within the preceding 24 months.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>52.212-4 Addenda:<br />(i)(3) "Payment" is tailored as follows: IAW FAR Clause 52.232-36(f), Contractor shall submit invoices for certification to the address identified in G-2 of this CSA.

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br /> (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br /> (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br /> (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br /> (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br /> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br /> (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>The USCG Project Resident Office - Gulf Coast (PRO GC) has a requirement to procure the services noted below. Quotations shall be submitted by e-mail to Eugene Feinberg at <a href="mailto:Eugene.M.Feinberg@uscg.mil">Eugene.M.Feinberg@uscg.mil</a>. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 721110. This notice is set aside 100% for small business participation. The USCG has a requirement for approximately 28 single and 41 double occupancy rooms for a crew of up to 110 USCG military personnel. The personnel will arrive in three groups, as shown in the attached Statement of Work (SOW), with the possibility of a fourth group of up to 12 personnel utilizing up to 6 double rooms and 2 single rooms. The basic requirement is for 22 April 2014 through 22 September 2014, with an option for an additional three months at the same rates as the base period. Services shall be provided in accordance with the attached SOW. Quotations will be evaluated on a best value basis, with emphasis on meeting the SOW requirements. The quoted property shall be within 30 miles of the Huntington Ingalls Incorporated (HII) shipyard at 2000 Jerry St. P&#1104; Highway, Pascagoula, MS. Quotations must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the terms and conditions contained in this solicitation and shall contain pertinent information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of all requirements of the SOW.&nbsp;Evaluation Factors:<br />1. Evaluation of Facility Condition by Site Visit<br />2. Safety of Site Location in Cooperation with Local Police<br />3. Past Performance<br />4. Price<br />Facility Condition and Site Location Safety are the most important factors and are of equal importance. Past Performance is less important than the Safety of Site Location and the Facility Condition factors. The Price factor is the least important factor; however, the Government is unable to contract with any facility that exceeds room rates in excess of the Federal Per Diem rates established for the Pascagoula, MS area by the General Services Administration (GSA). All Non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price. Site visits will be conducted by appointment, during March 27-28, 2014. The Government intends to award one firm, fixed-price contract for the required services without holding discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions, if in the Government's sole discretion, discussions are required. It is the vendors' responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for changes or amendments to the solicitation. Questions may be submitted to Mr. Feinberg on or before 10:00 AM Eastern Time, March 14, 2014. This Request for Quotation (RFQ) is issued pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.5, Homeland Security Acquisition Manual (HSAM) 3006-302-1, and Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) no. 2005-72 (JAN 2014).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard (USCG) Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).&nbsp; FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE, Washington, DC 20593-7828 or FAX 202-475-3904.

<p>&emsp;<br />Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Total Evaluated Price (TEP): Price proposals will be evaluated based on the TEP. The TEP will be calculated as the sum of the Offeror's proposed prices for a basic period, all option year periods (4 years), and 6-month extensions. Evaluation of options/extensions shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options or extensions. The TEP will be used for evaluation purposes only. Proposed pricing for the 6-month extension will be based on each Option period to determine the total evaluated price. IAW FAR 52.217-8, offerors should not propose different pricing for each 6-month extension. The rate should be based on that period's monthly rate. For example, the monthly rate used for CLIN 0002 should be the same rate used for CLIN 0001.</p>
<p>The 6-month extension of services is IAW FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services" and will only be utilized if necessary. The 6-month extension of services is not to be considered part of the Option Year periods and will be a separate option exercise if it is utilized. However, proposed pricing for the 6-month extension will be based on the current performance period's (base or subsequent option year) pricing as detailed in Section B of the resulting contract.</p>

<p><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTERS</p>
<p>2.0 EVALUATIONS FACTORS</p>
<p>The Government intends to establish up to three BPAs with responsible quoters offering the best value for Swahili, Hausa, English for Specific Purposes, and Faculty Development instruction services, price and other factors considered. Up to 3 master BPAs will be awarded based upon an integrated assessment of Language Skills, Education, Experience, Past Performance, and Price to determine the quoter(s) whose quote(s) contains a combination offering the best value to the Government. The integrated assessment may result in an award to other than the quoter(s) with the lowest evaluated price to the Government, if the non-cost benefits offered by another quoter warrants paying a higher price. Trade-offs will be made between the price and non-cost factors in order to determine the quoter(s) whose quote is the best value to the Government. All non-cost factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price. In the event that a higher priced quote shall merit the additional cost, the rationale for trade-offs will be documented in the file in accordance with FAR 13.501(b)(3).</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate submissions and award the BPAs without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of submissions that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of submissions in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated submissions. The Government may reject any or all quotes if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received.</p>
<p>The Government's evaluation will be based on quoters' abilities to provide one instructor capable of Swahili language instruction services, one instructor capable of providing Hausa language instruction services, one instructor capable of providing English for Specific Purposes instruction services, and one instructor capable of providing Faculty Development services.</p>
<p>The first Hausa language instruction services requirement is anticipated to occur in Garmisch-Partenkirchen from 19 May 2014 to 20 Jun 2014. If this requirement materializes, the Government reserves the right to award a Call to the vendor determined to be the best value for this requirement.</p>
<p>The first English for Specific Purposes instruction services requirement is anticipated to occur in Garmisch-Partenkirchen from 18 Aug 2014 to 26 Sep 2014.

<p>(t) System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />52.232-34 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER-OTHER THAN SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (JUL 2013)<br /><br />(a) Method of payment.</p>
<p>(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.</p>
<p>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-</p>
<p>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or</p>
<p>(ii) Request the Government to extend payment due dates until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).</p>
<p>(b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information.</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor is required to provide the Government with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: "designated office") by _______________ [the Contracting Officer shall insert date, days after award, days before first request, the date specified for receipt of offers if the provision at 52.232-38 is utilized, or "concurrent with first request" as prescribed by the head of the agency; if not prescribed, insert "no later than 15 days prior to submission of the first request for payment"]. If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).</p>
<p>(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.</p>
<p>(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.</p>
<p>(d) Suspension of payment.</p>
<p>(1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</p>
<p>(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.</p>
<p>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.</p>
<p>(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-</p>
<p>(i) Making a correct payment;</p>
<p>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and</p>
<p>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.</p>
<p>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-</p>
<p>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.</p>
<p>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.</p>
<p>(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>
<p>(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).</p>
<p>(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.</p>
<p>(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p>(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).</p>
<p>(6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p>(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.</p>

<p><br />FAR 52.209 -5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br /><br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br /><br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br /><br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br /><br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br /><br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br /><br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br /><br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br /><br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br /><br />(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br /><br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br /><br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br /><br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>Date:		March 07, 2014
<p>To:		All Interested Firms</p>
<p>Subject:	Amendment # 3</p>
<p>Ref.:		Request for Proposal #: SOL-663-14-000015</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification on the below issues related to the referenced RFP.</p>
<p>1.	In Section C of the RFP under C.3 it is mentioned that "The contractor will build the capabilities of USAID supported Ethiopian NGOs..." However, USAID would like to make it clear that the contractor will provide the capacity building service or technical assistance to NGOs, private companies, and local government entities that have an award and are in direct partnership with USAID. Technically, an NGO covers both charities/societies and private companies and local government entities could be universities and other public service providers owned by the host government.</p>
<p>2.	For any entity to operate in Ethiopia, the local legal registration is required. Therefore, all potential offerors should either have registration or has the capacity to obtain registration if successful.</p>
<p>3.	The PMP and the M&amp;E plan are to mean one and same thing. So the M&amp;E plan should be submitted as part of the technical proposal.</p>
<p>4.	The number of organizations in the third one year option is 40 and the revised RFP in amendment #2 reflected 35 erroneously.</p>
<p><br />Sincerely,</p>
<p>/ss/</p>

As stated in our initial synopsis (dated 31 Jan 14), we noted that we would be releasing portions of the draft SOW just prior to each of four industry days. The purpose of posting the draft SOW segments is to allow industry the opportunity to review prior to the Industry Day discussion on that specific topic and then gain industry comment/feedback on the documents after completion of the Industry Day.</p>
<p>Please review the attached draft SOW in preparation for the 6 Mar 14 Industry Day. The file name is "IDE_2017_Draft PM Infrastructure SOW". This portion of the SOW addresses both Program Management and Infrastructure requirements. To gain access to the draft SOW, you will need to follow the explicit access request process in FedBizOps</p>
<p><strong>Download, complete, and return the Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement for DMOC IDE 2017 to the AFNWC/PAIZ POCs listed in this announcement. Please provide questions/comments on the Draft SOW to Capt Duman and Ms. Tara Bond, via email, NLT COB 14 Mar 14.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOW, this FBO posting contains a draft of the DMOC Mission and Contracting Briefings that will be presented at Industry Day. Please note, to gain access to the Mission Briefing will also require you follow the explicit access request process.</p>
<p><strong>Your explicit access request will not be approved until we have verified your JPAS and received a copy of your DD2345. Please allow 2-3 days for this process to complete and for you to gain access to the locked documents.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: The Jun 2014 Industry Day will have a similar tour of the DMOC Battle Space. There will also be additional portions of the SOW released before that time. Contractors who were ineligible to participate in the March Industry Day may attend subsequent Industry Days granted all JPAS, DD 2345, and DoD security clearance information are accurate and coordinated through the proper AFNWC Contracting and DMOC channels before the deadlines.</p>
<p>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION announcement. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.</p>

<DESC>UPDATE: 7 MAR 14; The OCI Submission due date has been extended to 28 MAR 14 by 4:30pm MT. No other changes have been made at this time. <br>  <br>  <br> ORIGINAL NOTICE:  <br> PRESOLICITATION NOTICE  <br> TEST ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS SERVICES (TEAS)  <br>    <br>    <br>  PS-I - Introduction.    <br>    <br>  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for Test Engineering and Analysis Services, performed at WSMR, New Mexico.  A five-year (inclusive of option periods) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) single award contract is being considered for this effort.  The requirement is being set-aside for 8(a) Small Business concerns.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, Engineering Services, with a size standard of $35.5M.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or around 9 May 2014.  <br>    <br>  Due to the potential for Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCI), this acquisition will be conducted using the advisory multi-step process pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202.  The link to the draft Performance Work Statement will be listed at the bottom of this notice so potential offerors can make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition.  This synopsis constitutes the Pre-Solicitation Notice and Step 1 of the solicitation process.  In this step, potential offerors will submit OCI-Free certification or submit information on potential, actual, or perceived organizational conflicts of interest that may affect offeror's viability for award (no other capabilities will be evaluated during this step).  The MICC, WSMR Contracting Office requests that potential offerors submit information that will allow the Government to advise them about their potential as viable OCI-Free competitors.  The required submission information is outlined in  quote mark OCI Submission Instructions quote mark  below.  The offeror's submission shall be sent electronically to Mari B. Beckler at mari.b.beckler.civ@mail.mil and are due by 4:30pm MT on 14 March 2014.  Submissions not received by the deadline of 14 March 2014 at 4:30 pm MT will be handled as a Late Proposal subject to the rules in subparagraph c of FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisition.  <br>    <br>  After the Government reviews and evaluates OCI responses, each offeror shall be advised in writing if it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable OCI-Free competitor.  Respondents not considered viable competitors due to OCI issues will receive the general basis for these findings.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(b), those respondents will also be advised that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their OCI submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.  The invite to participate in resultant acquisition does not absolve the offeror of additional OCI scrutiny and the Government reserves the right to eliminate offerors from competition if conflicts are discovered at any point during the acquisition.  The decision to participate in this acquisition is a business decision made by the offeror and the Government shall not be held liable for excluding any offeror from participation based on OCI determination.  <br>    <br>  PS-II - Clauses that will be included in the resultant solicitation and contract.  <br>    <br>  (1) 5152.209-4000 PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (PCI). (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE)  <br>    <br>  The contractor shall not employ any person whose employment under the contract could in any way result in a conflict of interest.  The contractor shall not employ any person who is currently an employee of the Department of Army, military or civilian, to perform work under this contract if such employment would create a conflict of interest or be contrary to the policies contained in this PWS.  In no event shall such personnel be utilized in a supervisory capacity in the performance of this contract.  In addition, the contractor shall not offer a position to any current or former Department of Army employee, military or civilian, who has not first obtained the approvals required by DOD Directive 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), and implementing Army Regulations 24.  The contractor shall not employ any person who is a family member of either current contractor employees or current ATEC employees (either military or civilian) without first providing personnel qualifications, supervisory chain, and proposed employment duration to the Contracting Officer for review and concurrence.  <br>    <br>  (2) 5152.209-4001 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE)  <br>    <br>  In accordance with Section A - Executive Summary OCI, ATEC requires the Contractor to have the ability to conduct both developmental testing and operational testing without mitigation of potential OCIs.  Title 10, US Code Section 2399 prohibits the involvement of a defense contractor in the operational test and evaluation of its own systems and equipment.  Consequently, all parties must be particularly sensitive to potential, actual, or perceived organizational conflicts of interest where system contractors are, or appear to be, involved in the operational testing and evaluation of their own equipment or systems, including involvement as a test support contractor.  Such involvement is strictly prohibited. The Contractor acknowledges that it is cognizant of Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2399 and FAR 9.5 and agrees that it will avoid conflicts of interest and, to the maximum extent possible, the appearance of conflict of interest, in accordance with the principles set forth in the statute and the FAR.  The contractor also acknowledges that statutory operational testing and evaluation conflicts of interest arising under Title 10 U.S.C. 2399 and Army Regulation 73-1, paragraph 5-6, may not be mitigated or  quote mark firewalled quote mark  using the FAR 9.5 procedures.  <br>    <br>  (3) 5152.209-4002 DISCLOSURE OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST AFTER CONTRACT AWARD. (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE)  <br>    <br>  (a) If the Contractor identifies an organizational conflict of interest that was not previously addressed and for which a waiver has not been granted, or a change to any relevant facts relating to a previously identified organizational conflict of interest, the Contractor shall make a prompt and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Organizational conflicts of interest that arise during performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed before contract award, shall be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of-  <br>    <br>  (1) The organizational conflict of interest; and  <br>    <br>  (2) Actions to address the conflict that-  <br>    <br>  (i) The Contractor has taken or proposes to take; or  <br>    <br>  (ii) The Contractor recommends that the Government take.  <br>    <br>  (b) If, in compliance, the Contractor identifies and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest that cannot be addressed in a manner acceptable to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for the convenience of the Government.  <br>    <br>  (c) Subcontracts.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this special contract requirement, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts where the work includes or may include tasks that may create a potential for an organizational conflict of interest.  <br>    <br>  Please note, while this first step is advisory, should an organizational conflict be identified before contract award, the offeror may be determined to be ineligible for the award.   <br>    <br>  PS-III - OCI Submission Instructions  <br>    <br>  The offeror's submittal shall be submitted electronically and should include information on any potential Organizational Conflicts of Interests (OCI).  The offeror shall describe their involvement in the development of any DoD System with details including contract numbers, dates, programs supported, a copy of Performance Work Statement to include list of deliverables, as well as contact information for Program Manager points of contact and contracting office points of contact.  Offerors shall discuss any competitions for developmental work in which the company is involved regardless of the stage of the acquisition.  The offeror shall present its rationale for why the cited development work does not create an OCI.  Supporting information for the assertion that there is no OCI is vital to facilitate the Government's evaluation of an OCI.  The offerors will be required to identify teaming arrangements, subcontractor and any perceived conflicts of interest pursuant to Title 10 United States Code, Section 2399, FAR 9.5 and ATEC Policy Bulletin 2-11.  The offeror must certify, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that it is not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any organizational conflict of interest (potential or perceived) that impacts its ability to perform Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation (IOT&E) of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) systems.  The offeror must also include the same certification from each teaming partner and potential subcontractor.  Offerors' OCI certifications will be reviewed by contracting officer and legal support and an advisory notice will be given to each offeror.  A Non-OCI certification template is available via the link below; however, offeror's may submit the certification/information in any format compatible with Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Office, as long as it includes all of the required information and is certified. In responses from offerors that indicate a potential OCI exists, offeror responses are limited to no more than ten pages. However, this page limitation does not apply to supplemental data such as, independent PWS, etc.  <br>    <br>  The draft Performance Work Statement and OCI Free Certification Template are available at:  <br>    <br>  http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Contracting/Pages/default.aspx  <br>    <br>    <br>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA) is seeking information from biofuel and other nonfood producers to determine industry interest and capability in utilizing sugar in their manufacturing processes and also seeks information from sugar processors and other interested participants.
<p>This RFI serves only as the market research tool to survey and obtain information from sugar processors, biofuel producers, other nonfood producers, and any other interested participants. All information gathered in this response will be used solely for planning purposes.</p>
<p>Please provide responses to the following questions (categorized by general contact information, sugar processors, buyers of sugar, storage and miscellaneous) that pertain to you. These responses are requested by April 4, 2014, by regular mail, express mail, facsimile or email:</p>

<p>6. Where are your operations located (city/state)?</p>
<p>7. Is your plant (buyers of sugar) equipped to utilize sugar in your manufacturing process?</p>
<p>8. How common is the capability of biofuel producers to provide their own means of transportation? If they have the capability, do they typically receive sugar in bulk by truck and/or rail at their facility? How many trucks and/or rail cars can you handle per day?</p>
<p>9. Which type of sugar (sugar beet, sugar cane, in-process) would your operation be able to utilize?</p>
<p>10. If sugar is sold for yeast production, do you consider the yeast a non-food product? Please explain.</p>

<DESC>The time of the pre-proposal conference is changed to 10:30am on March 26, 2014.<br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest in Georgia is seeking to award multiple contracts for maintenance of forest land boundary lines. Work involves refurbishing property line markings (e.g. repainting previously marked trees, securing boundary signs), refurbishing corner accessories (bearing trees or witness objects), perpetuating corner monuments, and updating form FS-7100-52 Corner Card to reflect the work done.

Each task order will list the specific activity items.<br />The guaranteed minimum amount for each awarded contract, inclusive of the base and all option periods, will be $2,500. The combined value of the contract for all awards shall not exceed $500,000 over the base period and four option years.<br />All work sites will be located within the administrative boundaries of the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest.<br />OTHER INFORMATION: A pre-bid conference is scheduled for March 26, 2014 at&nbsp;10:30am at the Forest Service office in Gainesville GA. Details will be in the solicitation.<br />SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND DRAWINGS: The solicitation, AG-435H-S-14-0003 and related documents will be issued via FedBizOpps and will be available for downloading on or about March 12, 2014 at the website address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/<br />All vendors are required to be registered in www.sam.gov prior to award of a contract.<br />

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Provision 52.215-3 provided at: http://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_215.html#wp1144503. No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or services to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. <br /><br />The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research is exploring new options for collecting oceanographic, fisheries and hydrographic data to lessen reliance on research vessel support.
<p>Background Information: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration conducts ocean and atmospheric research at sea for the purpose of making science based decisions and determinations for the American public. These observations are for missions relating to the health of the oceans and marine fisheries, coastal resilience and coastal zone management, hydrographic survey to produce nautical charts, physical, chemical and biological oceanography, climate, and weather. These observations are commonly obtained by, or supported by ships. The value and utility of the NOAA research fleet is inestimable given the nature of the discoveries they have supported. As costs of operation grow and outpace NOAA's ability to sustain the traditional operational tempo of ships, plus the growth in the number of sea days now necessary to address NOAA's expanding mission, the need for complementary technology and new solutions to NOAA's observational challenges is apparent. The goal would be to identify those observations that can be obtained or supported by methods other than ships and redirect those efforts to those alternative technologies, while leaving for the ship based operations those methods and operations that only the ships can perform.</p>
<p>Capability Statement Objectives and Requirements: For the purpose of this announcement, observational data means measurements taken by research vessels and instruments deployed by vessels (buoys, floats, etc) and provided to the Government in a manner consistent with existing data flow and time series. In support of the NOAA mission, a Contractor would provide a methodology for collecting necessary ocean observational data, at specified locations and intervals.</p>
<p>NOAA seeks an analysis of current (market available), near-term (mature and market available in the next 3 to 5 years), and long-term (available in 5 to 10 years) solutions to meet mission needs. <br /><br />For each period of assessment, identify commercially available products that are on the market or available and can accoomplish NOAA's mission at a reduced cost per observation, yet sustain the scientific value and integrity of the process and information product, in accordance with the following ranked priorities:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Technology or methodology enables NOAA to meet existing observing requirements in a safer, more effective, or more efficient manner;<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Technology or methodology enables NOAA to meet previously unmet high priority observations that cound not be met due to inaccessibility, high cost, or high risk;<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Technology or methodology enables NOAA to augment existing observational capability to increase quality/quantity of data gathered by current platforms.<br /><br /><br /><br />The analysis should provide a comprehensive assessment of individual technology solutions capable of providing alternatives in performing NOAA's current ocean going missions, in accordance with the time period of the analysis - current, near-term, and long-term. This would include a list of platforms, devices, sensors, or methods that are produced and available today for procurement, and a characterization of the technical capability of the solutions identified. Alternatively, promising existing technologies that are incomplete should be identified with an assessment of what gaps accompany an existing solution. Cost is an analytical component and with all else equal, the driver. For example, if a set of oceanographic parameters measured in currently deployed tropical moorings, or methods of hydrographic survey can be performed by alternative platforms hosting the same of different sensors, those platforms and sensors that are capable of making the mission dependent measurements should be identified, compared and distinguished where appropriate. The result will be an inventory, technical and operational characterization, and comparative analysis of capability and cost. Attributes addressed should include sensor reliability, calibration stability, vehicle deployment methods or limitations, duration of deployment, known advantages and deficiencies of the technologies, procurement cost, and cost of operation and maintenance.</p>
<p>Additionally, in performing the analysis, technologies that may be ripe and available in the next 3 to 5 years would be identified, and third tier, what technology solutions will likely be available in more than 5 but up to 10 years.</p>
<p>1. Potential Respondents shall describe non-binding pricing, including, if appropriate, the manner in which charges levied for services rendered would be derived. Ideally, the Government is considering the potential to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract using a price per hourly observation fee schedule.</p>
<p>All response and response contents to this RFI will be considered informational only and will not be binding on the parties. Contractors responding to this request will not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the costs provided as a result of this request are "best" estimates only.<br />All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States government.<br />Responses to this RFI are due via email to Doris Turner no later than March 20, 2014 at 3:00 p.m. (Mtn Time). Provide all responses in MSWord 2000 (or later version) or Adobe .pdf. Point of Contact is Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent at doris.p.turner@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>THIS&nbsp;AMENDMENT IS HEREBY BEING ISSUED TO EXTEND THE CLOSING DATE OF&nbsp; SOLICITATION N00174-14-R-0005&nbsp;FROM 07 MARCH 2014 TO 17 MARCH 2014AS WELL AS TO ANSWER&nbsp;QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY POTENTIAL OFFERORS. <br /><br />****************************************************************<br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS BEING ISSUED TO CHANGE THE SOLICITATION NUMBER TO REFLECT N00174-14-R-0005. SOLICITAITON WAS RELEASED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON 03 FEBRUARY 2014...<br /><br />NSWC Indian Head requires contractor support in performing the functions of an Alteration Installation Team (AIT) with the installation of Ship Alterations (S/A), Ship Change Documents (SCDs), and Ordnance Alterations (ORDALTS) as related to the Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) on U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and U.S. Coast Guard Vessels. Contractor work shall be completed according to contract, and shall take place at varying locations and facilities including: private and public shipyards, pier side, in dry dock, CONUS, OCONUS, or at the contractor's facility. Thus, the expected contract vehicle referenced under this synopsis shall be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that will extend no longer than three years (36 months), if all options are exercised, from contract award. It will consist of one base year plus two option years. Task and delivery orders will be placed as both cost-plus-fixed-fee and firm-fixed-price, as appropriate. This requirement is considered full and open. The NAICS code is 541990. The Size Standard is $14M. The FSC code is 1230. This synopsis is for non-commercial services. The attached Data Requirements List and applicable instructions are included with this announcement. The upcoming solicitation number will be N00174-13-R-0044, and will be issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Proposals will be requested with the release of the solicitation.<br /><br />The Contractor's support shall be in accordance with specific, individually written task orders issued by NSWC IHD within the general scope of the applicable Statement of Work (SOW).<br /><br />The Government intends to make a single award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (a) technical capability of the items and services offered to meet the minimum needs of the Government based on examination of technical approach narrative, relevant corporate experience, facilities and equipment, and personnel resources; (b) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); and (c) Cost.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) St. Paul District intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for mechanical dredging services on the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri. <br /><br />Project work includes, but is not limited to, furnishing all plant, labor, material, and equipment necessary for dredging with a backhoe, dragline, or other mechanical equipment on marine plant, and transporting dredged material to designated placement sites. Contractor shall furnish, deliver, and operate dredge and attendant plant for maintenance dredging between Upper Mississippi River Miles 614.0 and 857.6 and between Minnesota River Miles 0.0 and 14.7 in the St. Paul District and between Upper Mississippi River Miles 614.0 and 300.0 in the Rock Island District. <br /><br />This procurement is a total small business set-aside. The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract consisting of a base period and four option periods. The estimated price range for the base period is between $1 million and $5 million. The appropriate NAICS code for this procurement is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities), with a small business size standard of $25.5 million. <br /><br />To comply with the Small Business requirement set forth at note (1) of Small Business Size Standard 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities), the small business prime contractor must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own dredging equipment or dredging equipment owned by another small dredging concern. The SBA has interpreted the 40 percent rule to apply only to equipment involved in the act of excavation and not to "auxiliary equipment" involved in other functions, such as the transportation of excavated sediment from the dredge site to the disposal site (see Size Appeal of American Construction Co. Inc., SBA No. SIZ-5420 (2012).

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Subject:  Network Management System Support Services
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, a Solicitation, a Request for Quote or, an indication that the Government will award a contract for the services contained in this RFI.  This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or, reimburse expenses incurred for responses to this RFI.  Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the capability and/or capacity to provide the equipment identified below.  Respondents should identify their company name, address, email, telephone number and a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives.  
This RFI is for The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OIT) and requires the vendor to provide Network Management support (NMS) Services for the Region 5 Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure.  These efforts include advocacy and maintenance of standardized lifecycle processes for VA tasks and projects.  These NMS services help with expanding and maintaining a fully stable Veteran's Benefit Administration (VBA) network, which is supported by Region 5 of Office of Information Technology (OIT) Service, Delivery and Engineering (SDE). This service also allows Region 5 to properly mitigate CRISP mandated actions to secure and safe guard the VBA network; those tasks include but not limited to converting all communication into a secure shell style of communication. This NMS contract is also in charge of trouble shooting the VBA network when something is wrong and determining the best course of action to fix the situation that had arouse. The NMS personnel work in-depth with Region 5 personnel to identify any type of network issue that could arise or happen which could cause a lapse in VBA production work.  VBA consists of over 58 LANs and many more small LANs in out- base facilities.  VA Region 5 has been tasked with implementation and support of these LANs and does not have sufficient in-house resources to perform the requirement, nor does the VA as an entire entity have the sufficient in house resources to perform the requirement.  In order to meet these needs in a timely fashion while supporting the growth in user base, Region 5 continues to require support staff, both to provide coverage for expanded hours, expanded responsibility, and to support the increase in the volume of user help requests.  With the additional complexity and the added enterprise requirements, plus the additional install/testing requirements.
Please see the attached Performance Work Statement for additional information and details. 

Responses shall be limited to less than eight (8) pages.  Responses should include, but not be limited to, respondent's capability info, suggested equipment lists, rough order of magnitude costs, and period of performance input.  Submissions are due NO LATER THAN 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), March 13, 2014 and may be made by e-mailing a response to: Joanne DeFazio at joanne.defazio@va.gov and Jan Oberdick at jan.oberdick@va.gov.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  
Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 16, 
Overton Brooks VA Medical Center, Shreveport, LA
VISN 16
2237# 667-14-1-468-0013
Total Estimated Contract Value: $415,000.00

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The proposed contracting action is for the purchase of Swank HealthCare Entertainment services for patients. Swank HealthCare shall provide patient entertainment featuring recent, first-run motion pictures from studios including: Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros., MGM, United Artists, Columbia Pictures, Universal Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Sony Pictures, DreamWorks, and Miramax Films. Patient Entertainment Programming shall consist of at least 28 motion pictures, with a minimum of seven pictures rotated out of the program and replaced by seven new pictures each quarter. Swank HealthCare is the exclusive distributor and representative for the Studios cited above for public performance in the healthcare market. All motion pictures shall be appropriately selected and sensitively edited for hospital standards and patient enjoyment.  The patient entertainment programming shall be delivered via a contractor-provided Digital Media Player that shall provide continuous automated digital education and entertainment at the facility. The Digital Media Player connects to the facility's head-end/closed circuit television system creating a specified TV channel in which the digital content is distributed. The contractor shall cover any and all maintenance of the Digital Media Player.    Contractor shall provide a patient program guide on-line, including a customized schedule of the view times for the motion pictures as developed by the site.  Contractor shall designate a full-time Programming Consultant to work directly with site POC to develop a Library necessary to meet their individual needs.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Sole source acquisition for the continuation of this service is required to maintain Hospital patient entertainment.  Swank HealthCare, is a division of Swank Motion Pictures, Inc.  Swank, located at 10795 Watson Rd., St. Louis, Missouri, 63127 will provide VISN 16 with a complete patient entertainment program, titled "Hospital Digital Cinema" as a full service patient entertainment program.  Swank also provides Hospital Patient Education consisting of a series on health and wellness information. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  .

	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Swank HealthCare maintains exclusive licensing agreements with the film distributors identified in section two above.  The agreement allows Swank to legally edit media before redistribution to the VA patient population.  The licensing agreement permits editing of the media content without violating copy write or re-broadcasting statues.     Swank Healthcare is the only know distributor licensed to edit and distribute media content for the film distributors identified item 2 above.  
 
6.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was conducted as required by FAR part 10.  GSA, VetBiz, and the SBA Dynamic database were all searched.  RFIs were sent to companies from each category. Two potential sources were identified.  One source submitted a response indicating they could provide the services if the requirement was only for programming services; the company's response explicitly stated it could not provide infrastructure support.  Swank HealthCare is currently providing programming services and network server equipment.  The servers are installed at each facility to interfacing with the VA's media distribution system\.  Based on their response, they will not be able to meet the requirement.  A second company indicated they could provide the requested services.  The company's website was reviewed using a link contained within their reply.  The company's core services are Wireless Telecom, Network, Business Continuity, Information Assurance, Test & Evaluation and Quality Assurance.   These core areas do not align with the current requirement.  

7.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  This proposed contracting action is for continued access to Swank HealthCare's Patient Entertainment Services.  The company currently has equipment installed at all hospitals throughout VISN 16.  Considering the nature of the licensing agreement between the Contractor and the film companies identified in item 2 above, there is no reasonable expectation of identifying an alternate responsible source for the required services.

8.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Swank Health Care, Manitou Motion Pictures, and Dodge City Communications Inc.

9.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:    Swanks Healthcare has exclusive licensing agreements with a number of film studios.  These agreements allow Swank to edit and redistribute content of licensed motion pictures making it audience appropriate for the VA patient population.   This licensing agreement is a commercial business practice beyond the scope of Government influence.  Based on this observation, there are no actionable measures available to the Government to effect competition.



10.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  
(This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service, someone with responsibility and accountability)
