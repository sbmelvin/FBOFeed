<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of Facility Maintenance and Operation Services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The contractor shall furnish management labor, transportation, and tools to accomplish maintenance, repair, operation and modification of facilities at the MMAC and off-site facilities leased to support the MMAC.  The FAA will provide at no cost to the Contractor, facilities for administrative use, shop space, vehicle parking, and storage space for supplies, materials, and equipment (refer to Statement of Work (SOW) Section 3 and Technical Exhibit 4).  The contractor shall also provide grounds maintenance services caring for lawns, shrubs, trees and areas leased by the MMAC.  Blizzard recovery which will include snow and ice removal action is included in the tasks required by the contract.  Requirements are further defined in the SOW.  The current version of the SOW, dated January 3, 2006, is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request (SIR)1. The contract will be for a 1-year base period with four 1-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  The contract type will be Cost-Plus-Award fee.  The contractor must have an acceptable accounting system for cost-reimbursable type contracts according to the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) standards. This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  Only those 8(a) firms that are certified under the SBA in Area VI (AR, LA, NM, OK, and TX) will be allowed to participate in this requirement.  To be considered the vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561210, Facilities Support Services, based on Government Base Facilities Operation Support Services - $32.5/million. Should an 8(a) vendor intend to incorporate a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" shall apply to the prime contractor. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program with SBA within Area VI an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  8(a) Certification and Business Declaration Form: 	(a) Provide certification letter from SBA documenting vendor's enrollment in the SBA's 8(a) program and classification as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code 561210, Facilities Support Services. 	(b) Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form. 2.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents "how well" an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has "done it."  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have a minimum of five (5) years experience in performing operation and maintenance services as identified in the attached SOW.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 3.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate the capability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 	(a) Vendors must demonstrate that an on-site Project Manager and Assistant Project Managers will be available at the time of contract award.  Qualifications of the Project Manager and Assistant Project Managers are identified in SOW, paragraph 1.2.2, Personnel Qualifications.  The documentation describing the individual's qualifications may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  It should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), and educational/training background in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and management competence. 	(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 80 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to, a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and the contracts on which they performed or a signed certified list of employees with date of employment including employees managers and the manager's qualification. 	4.  Accounting System and Financial Capability: 	Provide documentation that your company: 		(a) Currently has an "acceptable" job cost accounting system for cost-reimbursable type contracts according to the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) standards.  Identify your company's accounting system software package.  Provide the date of and the name of the DCAA field office performing the latest accounting systems audit.  Or, agree to obtain or develop a DCAA approved accounting system upon contract award at contractor's expense.

(b) Has the financial capacity to support biweekly expenses in the minimum amount of $250,000.  (Note: Present contract biweekly voucher expenditures up to $330,000 are typical.)

If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Streamline Numerics, Inc. of Gainesville, FL. This requirement is for modification and installation of their proprietary computational fluid dynamics tool STREAM in a Government High Performance Computing Modernization Program ( HPCMP)/ Major Shared Resource Center (MSRC) computer system. This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The STREAM software tool was developed by and is proprietary to Streamline Numerics, Inc.  This effort involves further development of a technology that no one other than Streamline Numerics, Inc. could facilitate without severe duplication of effort, and consequently, at a much higher cost. Streamline Numerics, Inc. is the only source that can meet this requirement. Purchase will be awarded on the basis of the quote submitted in response!   to the RFQ on or about July  25 2006.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City,  Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Period of performance will be through Dec 2007. NAICS 541511. FSC AJ24

The C-40A CACT program requires classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), and a FAA level 'C' or higher simulator.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level 'C' or higher under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 criteria for the Boeing 737-700/800 configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The following individual pilot/crew chief training courses are required:  C-40A Pilot Initial Training and C-40A Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training.  The training courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Boeing 737-700 IGW aircraft at time of training.  Instructors must be certified under Title 14 CFR Part 142.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.

For all courses, the contractor shall provide: All the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.  Pilot Initial course attendees will be designated Military Aviators.  Pilot Recurrent course attendees will be qualified Military C-40 Pilot-in-Command or Second Pilot Military Aviators that will have normally completed the C-40 Pilot Initial Course.  Pilot Recurrent training will be broken into 3 distinct tracks identified as follows:  1.) Pilot 1 Recurrent Training will be a Copilot refresher-training course; 2.) Pilot 2 Recurrent Training will be an Aircraft Commander Upgrade training course; 3.) Pilot 3 Recurrent Training will be a currently qualified Aircraft Commander recurrent training course.  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-40 Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.  The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-40 training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award to Advanced Acoustic Concepts, Inc. (AAC), 425 Oser Avenue, Hauppauge NY 11788, a contract for designing, and developing an acoustic simulation/stimulation hardware and software for installation at Manned Flight Systems, Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Maryland. The anticipated date for award is 15 August 2006. Delivery shall be 18 months after receipt of order. This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1( only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). 
The purpose of this procurement is to develop a standardized Common Acoustic Stimulator (CAS) to be used for multiple NAVAIR Programs. The CAS will ultimately support the needs  of the SH-60B Trainer Upgrade (TU) HH/SH-60H/F and MH-60S Training System Upgrades (FAST) and MH-60R / MH-60B Tactical Operational Flight Triners (TOFT 4-7) tasks.
AAC is and has been the sole source provider for the development, test, and integration the Common Acoustic Stimulator (CAS). AAC has supplied Acoustic Stimulators (AS) for integration in the MH- 60B/R TOFT Program and has developed and integrated the AS’s used on SH-60B TOFT, SH-60R TOFT.
AAC is also the developer of the primary components of Supportability Working Group (SupWG)  software utilized in the AS. The SupWG will be expanded to meet the current CAS requirement.
Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to complete the development of the current CAS  and deliver the final software and hardware technical data and documentation for the SH-60B, HH/SH-60H/F, & MH-60R Training System Upgrades, AAC is considered the sole source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equiment and experienced personnel necessary to successfully fulfill the government's requirements within current budget and time constraint. A solicitation will be issued on or about 09 August 2006. This procurement will result in a FFP contract. See numbered note 22 (substitute fifteen for forty five days).

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for: 1.	Pre-programmable load sequencing available on each of the individual load channels with millisecond resolution.  Both remote and local pre-programming options should be available.   2.	Load sequence triggering options, including: a) detection of power supply voltage at the load terminals, b) communications based triggering (e.g., General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB), RS-232, etc.), or c) a vendor specific triggering method.  3.	Load operations in the following standard operating modes: a) constant resistance, b) constant power, c) constant voltage, and d) constant current.   4.	General operations controllable from several industry-standard communications systems.  These are USB, GPIB, RS-232, and analog voltage control, as well as front panel controls.   5.	Compatibility with loads as high as 40 volts DC and power levels as high as 150 to 300 watts.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the Pre-programmable Electronic Load Bank based on a unique load sequence triggering capability. The trigger input that is offered is the unique feature that meets NASA’s most important immediate needs.  This need has arisen based on the configuration of the CEV load system.  This load system is to consist of several small loads (motors, solenoids, relays, etc.) which have not been fully developed at this time.  The procured load banks are to be used to simulate the several loads in integrated power system evaluations.  Each of the loads is to be capable of operating with a pre-programmed load profile simulating a particular load type.	The method to be used to control the several simulated loads is to switch power to the loads through a load switching system from a common power supply.  Each of the simulated loads is then to be triggered by detection of power supply voltage at the load terminals.  Since there is a considerable number of loads that could potentially be included in the power systems testing that NASA is planning, it will be imperative that each load be triggerable with detection of power supply voltage at load terminals, and to therefore operate independently of a larger control and monitoring system.  NASA power systems engineers have indicated that from 40 to 60 individual loads will be simulated with the load bank set that NASA is acquiring with this procurement.    This capability will allow each of the load banks to operate independently of a larger control and monitoring system and will allow each of the load banks to begin a pre-programmed sequence of loads at the detection of load voltage application at the load terminal inputs through a simple relay contactor.  NASA has determined that a system of independently-triggered, pre-programmed load banks is needed for its CEV power system testing.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 1, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 2, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Advances in genomics have led to the identification of hundreds of genes that have the potential for improving our understanding and management of cancer.  These genes have been identified primarily by alterations in their expression detected by experimental approaches including large scale mutation analysis or expression array analysis.  While these data often provide a useful starting point, information about a gene’s function leads to a better understanding of its role in the normal cell and in the cancer process and should lead to more effective biomarker identification and the design of therapeutics.

Functional analysis of genes has traditionally been tedious and time-consuming.  Biological assessment is usually performed by carefully manipulating the gene of interest either in vitro or in vivo and observing phenotypic changes.  These experiments are relatively quick in cell lines and lower model organisms such as C. elegans or S. cerevisiea; however in higher animal models, like mice, the protocols are time consuming and involve sophisticated gene transfer and subsequent breeding.    

RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) are evolutionarily ancient mechanisms to regulate gene expression that have recently been discovered and exploited in a broad range of organisms as a fast and efficient methodology for functional genetics.  There are two basic methods for the use of noncoding RNA for gene–specific inhibition of transcription or translation: 1) cytoplasmic delivery of short dsRNA oligonucleotides (siRNA), which mimic an active intermediate of an endogenous RNAi mechanism and 2) nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes that express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which mimic the interfering miRNA active intermediate of a different endogenous RNAi mechanism.  Both of these have proven effective in experimental settings and have specific strengths and weaknesses (Nature Biotechnology 23, 227 – 231, 2004).  Success of the RNAi technology in tissue culture and animals has been dependent on delivery systems for transporting the RNA or construct into the cell of interest.  Non-viral gene delivery systems are a diverse collection of technologies that are applicable to both of these forms of RNAi.  Viral delivery systems efficiently transfer the RNAi into cells either transiently or for stable production.  Viral vectors also allow the use of the more efficient shRNA.  The technology has already revolutionized functional genomic studies, however, there is variation of inhibition which is dependent on the specific sequences within each targeted gene, and in some instances the cell type.  While much of this functional variation of RNAi constructs is sequence related, the biological mechanism of these effects is not understood sufficiently to predict success, failure or partial effect.  Therefore, in order for these reagents to be broadly used tools, RNAi expression systems and formats need extensive verification of biological activity, i.e. ability of the particular RNAi constructs to specifically down-regulate or eliminate protein’s expression.

Many RNAi constructs and RNAi libraries have been generated to date.  They have proven useful in the identification of new oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.  In addition, these molecules can be used to functionally confirm the importance or impact of specific genes or proteins in the carcinogenic process (Willingham  et al. (2004) RNAi and HTS exploring cancer through systematic loss of function, Oncogene 23:8392; Hannon & Rossi (2004) Unlocking the potential of the human genome with RNA interference, Nature 431:371).  This functional knowledge is not only important in the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets but provides the initial insight into the overall design of normal and cancer cells.

The Integrative Cancer Biology Program (ICBP) of the National Cancer Institute is a consortium of research centers utilizing a systems biology approach to understanding cancer processes.  The centers use both experimental and mathematical approaches to develop computational models of cancer processes.  These centers focus on specific cancers and mechanisms, such as signaling pathways and tumor migration.  As a group they have identified areas of common interest and common need.  The NCI‘s ICBP has identified RNAi technology and resources as one of the critical tools to facilitate both their research and that of the broader cancer research community.  With consultation of the ICBP investigators, the NCI staff has determined that a library of validated RNAi resources would benefit NCI cancer research efforts.  This library would initially consist of shRNAs targeted to genes chosen collectively by the ICBP investigators and deemed important in cancer research.

This request for proposals is to obtain and evaluate shRNA lentiviral vector expression constructs for 134 human genes selected by the NCI.  Preference is for the Hannon lentiviral library (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/RNAi ) however if a sufficient number of constructs for each gene are unavailable in that library, the RNAi Consortium (TRC) http://www.broad.mit.edu/genome_bio/trc/rnai.html) library may act as a source for constructs to be evaluated.  This contract will cover the biological testing of those constructs, the posting of the evaluation data, and the distribution or appropriate transfer of the material.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

1.  Step van/panel truck 
2.  Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo
3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks
5.  Tour buses 
6.  Garbage/recycled waste trucks
7.  Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks
8.  Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker 
This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.

The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

All vehicles larger than a large pick-up truck are required to be inspected by the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Commercial Vehicle Delivery Gate (CVDG) prior to entering the installation.  Vehicles to be inspected include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Step van/panel truck 
2.  Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo
3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks
5.  Tour buses 
6.  Garbage/recycled waste trucks
7.  Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks
8.  Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker 
This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks

This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

Department of the Air Force, HQ Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence,  HQAFCEE, and 311 Human Systems Wing (HSW)/PK, 8150 Aeromedical Road, Brooks City-Base, TX, 78235-5123. Description:  Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Program Office – San Antonio, and the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal for the Privatization of Military Family Housing for the AETC Group II project on or about 25 July 2006. The AETC Group II project consists of six bases: Columbus AFB, MS; Goodfellow AFB, TX; Laughlin AFB, TX; Maxwell AFB, AL; Randolph AFB, TX; and Vance AFB, OK. Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a one-step RFP process. In their proposals, each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources, financial strategy, and a description of its technical approach to the AETC Group II project as described in the RFP. Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranking Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force. The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction.  These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP. The AETC Group II project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,338 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,338 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years. The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,530 housing units, primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Project Owner (PO). The Government may subsidize the project's financing as described in the RFP. The PO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the AETC Group II family housing inventory. Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the PO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the PO. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Request for Proposal is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<CONTACT>Debora Gray, (757) 201-7551
<DESC>MILITARY CONSTRUCTION (MILCON) CENTERS OF STANDARDIZATION NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INFORMATION:  This is an advance notice concerning the hosting of four regional Industry Day Forums in order to perform market research on Request(s) for Proposal(s) that ma y be issued in support of the Centers of Standardization Military Construction (MILCON) Program.   The Army is undertaking a significant shift in emphasis and prioritization with respect to resources and priorities.  This shift is driven by a reassessment of the strategic and operational environments and the Armys responsibilities to provide relevant a nd ready land power capabilities to commanders as part of the Joint Force now and in the future.  To realize the objectives of the emphasis shift, the Army is pursuing the most comprehensive transformation of its forces since the early years of World War I I.  The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41 facility types as described below.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.  This questio nnaire need only be completed one time for the entire MILCON COS Program.  This information will be gathered according to the Armys Installation Management Agencys (IMA) four regions which are: Northeast Region (NER), Northwest Region (NWR), Southeast Re gion (SER), and Southwest Region (SWR).  Please see the market research website for a map of the states covered by each of the IMAs regions.  The market research questionnaire will be available at the following web site: https://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil/ebs /Market_Research/MarketResearchSurveyForm.cfm?ProjectID=1.  This questionnaire will be open for input on August 4, 2006, through September 4, 2006.  The US Army Corps of Engineers will execute projects of all sizes.  Therefore, it is important for Industry  to respond to this market survey and demonstrate its experience relative to each of the facility types.  The results of the survey will help the Government determine Industrys experience and capability to execute the requirements.  As this is a nation-wi de survey, you will only need to complete this survey one time for your interest and capability to be included in our research.  As a result, the acquisition strategies will potentially include both set-aside projects and unrestricted projects.   The targeted industry groups for this survey are traditional construction firms, architect-engineer firms, and contractors that provide non-traditional construction methods, such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized, Tilt-up, and Permanent Modular construction.  This Construction Program will consist of the following facility types: Physical Fitness Facility, Outdoor Sports Facility, Child Development Center  Infant/Toddlers, Child Development Center  School Age, Youth Activity Center, Consolidate d fire, Safety & Security Facility, Fire Station, Army Community Service Center, Bowling Center, Hazardous Material Storage Facility, Close Combat Tactical Trainer, Military Operations Urban Terrain Facility, Training Ranges, Battle Command Training Center , Training Support Center, Army Reserve Center,     Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC), General Instruction Building, Classroom, Enlisted Personnel Dinning Facility, Military Entrance Processing Station, Family Housing, Information Systems Facil ity, Criminal Investigation Facility, Religious Facility, Acces s Control Points, Aviation  Vertical Construction, 4-Star HQ Facility, National Guard Armory, Company Operations Facility, Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility, Brigade Operations Complex, Brigade/Battalion HQ: Admin, Command and Control Army (UEy) & C orps (UEx) HQ: Admin/Ops, Deployment Facility, Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (Barracks), Basic Combat Training Complex (BCT) / One Station Unit Trainee (OSUT), Advanced Individual Training Complex (AIT), General Purpose Warehouse, Central Issue Warehouse, Hospitals, and Medical Facilities (health clinics, dental clinics, and medical clinics) to support the Centers of Standardization Army MILCON requirements.

The execution of the work under the Military Constru ction Program will be accomplished using a product line concept for the facilities.  The product line concept will be used for the construction of barracks, dining facilities, company operation facilities, headquarters buildings, vehicle maintenance shops,  unit and ammunition storage facilities, aviation facilities, equipment parking areas, and other features of the program.  Under the product line concept, Districts in the Corps of Engineers Southwestern and South Pacific Divisions will be assigned one or two facility types and will be responsible for awarding Design-Build IDIQ contracts for their assigned type of facility (product line).  When there is a requirement for their facility type, each District product line team will scope, negotiate, and award a  task order to deliver the required facilities to the Program Office assigned to manage the overall project.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Mid Atlantic Health Care Network (VISN 6) intends to negotiate a sole source commercial item procurement with The Richmond Ambulance Authority for a one year contract period to provide ambulance service for veterans serviced by the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, VA).  The NAICS is 621910; $6.0M.  The contract will include a requirement for Basic Life Support and Advanced Life Support Ambulance Services. The contractor shall furnish 24-hour ambulance service for the beneficiaries of the VAMC on an as needed basis, and for patients with regular standing appointments at either the VAMC or the Medical College of Virginia.  Contractor must include verifiable documentation attesting that the contractor holds a City franchise or permit, pursuant to the Code of the City of Richmond [Ord. No. 90-45-68 (11-59)], granting authority to provide emergency medical service in the City of Richmond.  The ambulance (emergency medical care vehicle) under the terms of this contract will be licensed and meet the minimal vehicle requirements as established by the Board of Health, Commonwealth of Virginia, Emergency Medical Services, 1538 East Parham Road, Richmond, VA, 23228, dated July 1990 (or most recent).  The specifications are mandatory as minimal requirements for such vehicles, but chassis or compartment modifications are permissible when they clearly exceed the minimal specifications.  This proposed procurement is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement no later than Noon, July 26, 2006, local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Ginger Gruber, 402-221-4103
<DESC>MILITARY CONSTRUCTION (MILCON) CENTERS OF STANDARDIZATION NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INFORMATION:  This is an advance notice concerning the hosting of four regional Industry Day Forums in order to perform market research on Request(s) for Proposal(s) that ma y be issued in support of the Centers of Standardization Military Construction (MILCON) Program.   The Army is undertaking a significant shift in emphasis and prioritization with respect to resources and priorities.  This shift is driven by a reassessment of the strategic and operational environments and the Armys responsibilities to provide relevant a nd ready land power capabilities to commanders as part of the Joint Force now and in the future.  To realize the objectives of the emphasis shift, the Army is pursuing the most comprehensive transformation of its forces since the early years of World War I I.  The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41 facility types as described below.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.  This questio nnaire need only be completed one time for the entire MILCON COS Program.  This information will be gathered according to the Armys Installation Management Agencys (IMA) four regions which are: Northeast Region (NER), Northwest Region (NWR), Southeast Re gion (SER), and Southwest Region (SWR).  Please see the market research website for a map of the states covered by each of the IMAs regions.  The market research questionnaire will be available at the following web site: https://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil/ebs /Market_Research/MarketResearchSurveyForm.cfm?ProjectID=1.  This questionnaire will be open for input on August 4, 2006, through September 4, 2006.  The US Army Corps of Engineers will execute projects of all sizes.  Therefore, it is important for Industry  to respond to this market survey and demonstrate its experience relative to each of the facility types.  The results of the survey will help the Government determine Industrys experience and capability to execute the requirements.  As this is a nation-wi de survey, you will only need to complete this survey one time for your interest and capability to be included in our research.  As a result, the acquisition strategies will potentially include both set-aside projects and unrestricted projects.   The targeted industry groups for this survey are traditional construction firms, architect-engineer firms, and contractors that provide non-traditional construction methods, such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized, Tilt-up, and Permanent Modular construction.  This Construction Program will consist of the following facility types: Physical Fitness Facility, Outdoor Sports Facility, Child Development Center  Infant/Toddlers, Child Development Center  School Age, Youth Activity Center, Consolidate d fire, Safety & Security Facility, Fire Station, Army Community Service Center, Bowling Center, Hazardous Material Storage Facility, Close Combat Tactical Trainer, Military Operations Urban Terrain Facility, Training Ranges, Battle Command Training Center , Training Support Center, Army Reserve Center,     Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC), General Instruction Building, Classroom, Enlisted Personnel Dinning Facility, Military Entrance Processing Station, Family Housing, Information Systems Facil ity, Criminal Investigation Facility, Religious Facility, Acces s Control Points, Aviation  Vertical Construction, 4-Star HQ Facility, National Guard Armory, Company Operations Facility, Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility, Brigade Operations Complex, Brigade/Battalion HQ: Admin, Command and Control Army (UEy) & C orps (UEx) HQ: Admin/Ops, Deployment Facility, Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (Barracks), Basic Combat Training Complex (BCT) / One Station Unit Trainee (OSUT), Advanced Individual Training Complex (AIT), General Purpose Warehouse, Central Issue Warehouse, Hospitals, and Medical Facilities (health clinics, dental clinics, and medical clinics) to support the Centers of Standardization Army MILCON requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.  The Solicitation Number for this announcement is N62467-06-R-0104.  Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested parties with a priority on: 8(a) firms, Service Disabled Veteran Owned small businesses, and HubZone small businesses, to participate in a single phase solicitation for the construction of Munitions Facilities at Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina.  The 2002 NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the small business size standard is $31 Million.  The Federal Supply Code is Y171, Construction of Facilities/Office Buildings.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with its own employees. The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  A decision will be made to issue this solicitation as a competitive set-aside for 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or HubZone Small Business contractors or to issue an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.  The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  

The Munitions Facilities construction project consists of four separate buildings.  The proposed sites for the new buildings are located in the existing Munitions Facilities Compound on the northeastern portion of the base.  The site area is defined by an existing secured perimeter chain-link fence and includes munitions and equipment storage areas.   

The Munitions Administration/Mobility Storage Building combines administrative and storage functions.  The Munitions Administration/Mobility Storage Building consists of approximately 6960 SF of administrative space and 8042 SF of high bay storage for a total of 15,002 SF gross building area.  The new facility will be constructed utilizing a pre-engineered building structure with a 3:12 pitch metal roof and metal siding.  A 4 ft height, split-face CMU wainscot will be provided around the administration portion of the new facility.  The remainder of the exterior wall will consist of pre-engineered metal panels.  Interior partitions in the administration area will be metal studs with gypsum board.  Floors will be carpet in the offices and VCT in the corridors and break rooms.  Restrooms and locker rooms will have ceramic tile floors.  The storage bays consist of twelve bays (55 ft x 12 ft) for trailer storage and space for training functions.  Demolition of Buildings 1800, 1801, and 1803 will be required before construction is started on the new building.  Demolition of Buildings 1805 and 1807 will be deferred until construction is complete on the new building in order to phase the occupancy of the administration areas.  The total demolition area is 5000 SF 

The Four-Bay Maintenance Facility contains approximately 3784 SF of administrative space and 5166 SF of munitions maintenance area consisting of four drive-through bays for a total of approximately 8950 SF.  Three of the walls separating the bays will be Substantial Dividing Walls or “Blast Walls”, which are required for prevention of propagation of burning reactions.  The new facility will be constructed utilizing a pre-engineered building structure with a 3:12 pitch metal roof and metal siding.    Interior partitions in the administration area will be metal studs with gypsum board.  Floors will be carpet in the offices and VCT in the corridors and break rooms.  Restrooms and locker rooms will have ceramic tile floors.  Specialized equipment in the maintenance bays includes low and high-pressure air and 400hz power for support of portable air ground equipment.  A catenary lightning protection will be provided for the Four-Bay Maintenance Facility.

The third and fourth buildings are each 2080 square foot munitions storage igloos.  The storage igloos will have reinforced concrete bearing walls with reinforced concrete roof, floor and foundation systems.  The structures will be earth covered and will feature blast-resistant steel doors, explosion-proof lighting, exterior security lighting, an intrusion detection system, and a catenary lightning protection system.

The work for each new building includes communication and fire protection systems, all supporting utilities, and site work consisting of parking aprons, access drives, and landscaping.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $6,000,000 and $6,750,000.

<DESC>MILITARY CONSTRUCTION (MILCON) CENTERS OF STANDARDIZATION NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INFORMATION:  This is an advance notice concerning the hosting of four regional Industry Day Forums in order to perform market research on Request(s) for Proposal(s) that ma y be issued in support of the Centers of Standardization Military Construction (MILCON) Program.   The Army is undertaking a significant shift in emphasis and prioritization with respect to resources and priorities.  This shift is driven by a reassessment of the strategic and operational environments and the Armys responsibilities to provide relevant a nd ready land power capabilities to commanders as part of the Joint Force now and in the future.  To realize the objectives of the emphasis shift, the Army is pursuing the most comprehensive transformation of its forces since the early years of World War I I.  The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41 facility types as described below.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.  This questio nnaire need only be completed one time for the entire MILCON COS Program.  This information will be gathered according to the Armys Installation Management Agencys (IMA) four regions which are: Northeast Region (NER), Northwest Region (NWR), Southeast Re gion (SER), and Southwest Region (SWR).  Please see the market research website for a map of the states covered by each of the IMAs regions.  The market research questionnaire will be available at the following web site: https://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil/ebs /Market_Research/MarketResearchSurveyForm.cfm?ProjectID=1.  This questionnaire will be open for input on August 4, 2006, through September 4, 2006.  The US Army Corps of Engineers will execute projects of all sizes.  Therefore, it is important for Industry  to respond to this market survey and demonstrate its experience relative to each of the facility types.  The results of the survey will help the Government determine Industrys experience and capability to execute the requirements.  As this is a nation-wi de survey, you will only need to complete this survey one time for your interest and capability to be included in our research.  As a result, the acquisition strategies will potentially include both set-aside projects and unrestricted projects.   The targeted industry groups for this survey are traditional construction firms, architect-engineer firms, and contractors that provide non-traditional construction methods, such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized, Tilt-up, and Permanent Modular construction.  This Construction Program will consist of the following facility types: Physical Fitness Facility, Outdoor Sports Facility, Child Development Center  Infant/Toddlers, Child Development Center  School Age, Youth Activity Center, Consolidate d fire, Safety & Security Facility, Fire Station, Army Community Service Center, Bowling Center, Hazardous Material Storage Facility, Close Combat Tactical Trainer, Military Operations Urban Terrain Facility, Training Ranges, Battle Command Training Center , Training Support Center, Army Reserve Center,     Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC), General Instruction Building, Classroom, Enlisted Personnel Dinning Facility, Military Entrance Processing Station, Family Housing, Information Systems Facil ity, Criminal Investigation Facility, Religious Facility, Acces s Control Points, Aviation  Vertical Construction, 4-Star HQ Facility, National Guard Armory, Company Operations Facility, Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility, Brigade Operations Complex, Brigade/Battalion HQ: Admin, Command and Control Army (UEy) & C orps (UEx) HQ: Admin/Ops, Deployment Facility, Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (Barracks), Basic Combat Training Complex (BCT) / One Station Unit Trainee (OSUT), Advanced Individual Training Complex (AIT), General Purpose Warehouse, Central Issue Warehouse, Hospitals, and Medical Facilities (health clinics, dental clinics, and medical clinics) to support the Centers of Standardization Army MILCON requirements.

Disclaimer: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.202 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contra ct. This is a pre-solicitation RFI and I2WD is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received. Description: The Soft Target Exploitation and Fusion (STEF) Army Technology Objective (ATO) seeks to produce actionable (1) geospatially, temporally, and contextually-relevant correlated intelligence on individuals; (2) best known location, track and predi ction of location for individuals; (3) association of individuals to pieces of equipment and facilities; (4) association of individuals to events; (5) organizations and their membership, makeup, and their geospatial points of presence. STEF will take as in put the ever-increasing amount of information buried within intelligence databases, and when available, near real time data on individuals who can be uniquely tracked by equipment, events, relationships, other individuals, etc. To accomplish STEF objective s, structured and unstructured information, primarily text, must be transformed into a readily exploitable form of semantic knowledge. The STEF program will focus on algorithmic development and implementation of fusion and analysis engines, the design of t he required data stores, and the process flows and interfaces required to support both automated processing and user in-the-loop analysis. Employed synergistically, the above functions support Situation Awareness (SA)/Situation Understanding (SU).  I2WD is interested in receiving information on algorithms, techniques, and/or software components currently in development or already in existence that support the ATO objectives. It should be noted that STEF will not attempt to generate advanced knowledge , predictive analyses, or profiles for organizations and events, but will provide a foundation for higher-level fusion research and product development. Responses to this RFI should include a white paper of no more than 20 pages describing the algorithm and results-to-date, as well as points of contact for Government sponsors, where applicable, and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to develop,  implement and test. Responses are to be received by 14 August 2006, 3:30 p.m. EST.  All information must be in writing. Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>B -- Enhances Surveillance at the Omaha Lead Site, Nebraska
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a sole source contract to the Douglas County Health Department (DCHD), Omaha, Nebraska.  Within Douglas County, the DCHD is the public health agency that is legally tasked to surveil for childhood blood lead test results.  Background:  The American Smelting and Refining Company operated a lead refinery on the west bank of the Missouri River in downtown Omaha from the early 1870's to 1997.   Lead from those activities is considered the primary source for soil contamination in Omaha.  The Omaha Lead Site (OLS) covers about 8,840 acres.  In 2000, approximately 86,000 residents lived within OLS and an estimated 13, 460 of these are children aged 6 and younger.  To reduce lead exposure to children, since 1999, EPA has been remediating soil from properties with elevated soil lead levels.  Since 1999, results from all blood lead testing have been required to be reported to the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program at the Douglas County Health Department (DCHD).  In 2004, only 35% of children less than 7 years of age who reside in the OLS were tested for blood lead.  The goal of this Enhanced Surveillance project is to increase the number of children tested for blood lead poisoning. Surveillance data could be used to help assess the effectiveness of soil remediation in the OLS. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement with written notice to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries may be sent to Carla Harper by e-mail at AUY1@CDC.GOV

The following individual pilot/crew chief training courses are required:  C-40A Pilot Initial Training and C-40A Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training.  The training courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Boeing 737-700 IGW aircraft at time of training.  Instructors must be certified under Title 14 CFR Part 142.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.

Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-40 Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.  The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-40 training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification.

<SUBJECT>81 -- Packaging for BEAR systems
<DESC>The Government intends to host an Industry Day to solicit ideas for commercially available packaging solutions for optimizing packing of equipment in 20 foot ISO shipping containers. This is a request for information only. This notice does not constitute an IFB or RFP and is not to be construed as a committment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the Industry Day nor for the time or expense of those industry participants involved.   

Air Force Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) systems include 5 different equipment sets including Housekeeping, Flight Line and Industrial Operations configurations.   Assets vary from rolling stock and large end items to small repair and spares parts which support shelters, water and power distribution systems, kitchens, latrines, etc.  The assets are grouped by "capability".  For example, spares and repair parts needed to support equipment when deployed are packaged in the same container as the equipment end items.  Current packaging is optimized for air deployment on military aircraft using standard 463L pallets and 463L-compatible ISU-90 containers.  

Program objective is to transition a number of BEAR sets to TRICON and 20' side opening  intermodal shipping containers for truck and sea movement.  ISO packing must allow for continued grouping by capability plus the ability to remove packed items in 20’ ISO using a 13K forklift at deployed locations and also allow rapid conversion back to 463L configurations when necessary.  Preliminary investigations have shown there is real potential for damage and considerable loss of efficiency when attempting to pack piece parts on standard 108" X 88" pallets in 20' ISOs and secure them for transport with nets (see photos attached).  

The purpose of this Request for Information is to solicit commercially available packing solutions that are readily adaptable to the concept of operations  (CONOPs)  outlined above.  This would include but not be limited to racks, shelving, and/or modular and stackable boxes that readily fit inside TRICON and or 20' ISOs and can be safely handled with 13K forklifts.  We intend to host an Industry day at Dyncorp's  Albany Aggregation Site (AAS), 601 Holly Drive,  Albany GA on  29 Aug 2006 to allow interested vendors to tour the warehouse and actually see the assets that require packaging. This will also be an opportunity for vendors to discuss/display/propose prospective or alternative solutions that could satisfy long term outdoor storage requirements, and still address the limiting factors (13K forklift) of the CONOPs outlined above.

For planning purposes please contact, Ms. Melinda Griffin (Melinda.Griffin@dyn-intl.com) phone 229-903-3102 or Mr. Phil Milling (phillip.milling@dyn-intl.com) phone 229-903-3103 at Dyncorp's  facility by 22 Aug 2006 with names of people attending, equipment/items you will bring, space needed for display, etc.  For additional information related to packing specifics please contact TSgt Ron Doll (ronald.doll@holloman.af.mil)  or SSgt Daren Manson (daren.manson@holloman.af.mil) , at Holloman AFB NM phone 505-572-3358.

Announcement:     The Protein Science Consortium (PSC) is a cooperative association of the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  ANL is a government-owned/contractor operated (GOCO) facility managed by the University of Chicago, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  BNL, ORNL and PNNL are government owned/contractor operated (GOCO) facilities managed by Battelle.  LANL is a national security laboratory managed as government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO), federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). As the five national laboratories are each federally funded research and development centers, each laboratory and the PSC is bound by fairness of opportunity requirements and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs). 
The Genome to Life program (GTL) in the Office of Biological and Environmental Research (OBER) of the Office of Science, U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released a draft RFP for a GTL Facility for the Production and Characterization of Protein and Molecular Tag, Funding Opportunity No. 
DE-PN02-06ER64154 
https://e-center.doe.gov/iips/faopor.nsf/UNID/036C90C51E5B565685257111007D1111/$file/GTL+PN0206ER64154+GrantsGov+Feb+10+Amd+001.pdf 


The Facility for the Production and Characterization of Proteins and Molecular Tags, will surmount a principal roadblock to whole-system analysis of biomolecular networks that is the foundation for the entire GTL program by implementing high-throughput production and characterization of microbial proteins. This Facility will bring together, for the first time, comprehensive technologies to mass-produce and characterize microbial proteins directly from sequence data and to generate specific 'capture and labeling' affinity reagents for each protein. The availability of these characterized proteins and "tags" to capture, identify, and track them in living systems will provide a crucial resource for researchers. This will enable development of methods to determine how and under which condition these proteins and protein complexes function in cellular processes. The development of this facility will require additional research to develop the core technologies that will underpin the capabilities of the Facility including the development of technologies for high-throughput production of proteins and their biophysical characterization, and for the production of molecular tags to identify individual proteins and to characterize multi-protein complexes in microbial cells. Production and characterization technologies should be scalable, economic, and sufficiently robust to work in a production environment. At least 50% of all proteins are anticipated to pose significant problems for any current production method. Consequently, a significant component of this project will be research into new methods of protein production. Improved techniques are also needed to predict from genome sequence what production and purification approaches are most likely to succeed with each protein. Thus, informatics also is an integral component. Algorithms based on data from successful and failed protein expressions are expected to substantially inform and improve future protein production efficiency. The Facility will produce, characterize, and make available a wide range of microbial proteins from both cultivated and uncultivated microbes for use by the scientific community in their individual research projects. Ready availability of these resources will free the nation's scientists to apply their energies to understanding these microbes, a major step toward using microbial capabilities.

For parties interested in supporting and/or working with the PSC on the proposed user facility for the Production and Characterization of Proteins and Molecular Tags, please respond in writing to the PSC byApril 4, 2006 addressing each of the items listed below.     PSC will respond back by April 11, 2006.

This combined synopsis/solicition is set aside 100% for small business.

Brief Description of Project:

This Statement of work sets forth the requirements for an integrator to provide and install ten commercially available off-the-shelf multichannel NTSC television break-away/automation systems which are already currently offered for sale to commercial broadcasters and cable system operators.  Each of these systems shall playout eight independent channels and be scalable for future expansion.  These systems will enable American Forces Radio and Television Servcie (AFRTS) manned affiliates at ten geographically separated locations to automatically and manually insert commercial breaks (spot material) into network programming streams and provide long and short form programming throughout a broadcast day in the event that network feeds are lost.

Locations for this contract are:
	Operating Location-A, Detachment 4 AFNEWS, FELTWELL, England
	Detachment 6 AFNEWS, LAJES, Azores
	Detachment 7 AFNEWS, INCIRLIK, Turkey
	Detachment 8 AFNEWS, AVIANO, Italy
	Detachment 9 AFNEWS, SPANGDAHLEM, Germany
	Detachment 10 AFNEWS, YOKOTA (TOKYO), Japan
	Detachment 11 AFNEWS, OKINAWA, Japan
			Detachment 12 AFNEWS, MISAWA, Japan
			Detachment 13 AFNEWS, IWAKUNI, Japan
Detachment 14 AFNEWS, SASEBO, Japan
	 
Each of these locations receives primary programming from the Network headquarters, Defense Media Center-Broadcast Center (DMC-BC), Riverside, California via satellite service to Europe and the Pacific.  There exists in addition to the local automation requirement a requirement for transcoding of material using Anystream Agility to provide product to an automation system already owned by the Government and used in Germany.

4.1.	System Concept
The basic system concept is for the Television Break-away/Automation System to insert local spot breaks and News into the AFRTS program stream.  Schedules for each of the eight channels are provided by Network headquarters, also referred to as the DMC-BC, 3-5 days in advance and indicate the break times or “avails” in which to insert local products. Local manipulation of the scheduled breaks does not normally occur. For the purposes of this document the terms “spot”, “product”, “interstitial material”, “short form” or “long form”  are synonymous in that they refer to television program material produced or recorded in-house for air at a later time.

Our simplified TV automation concept for this award covers three main areas of functionality. 

a.	The Playlist Management System, residing at the User layer, which interfaces to the AFRTS Network schedules. It also plans schedules,  provides reports, and controls the automation software. Ingest plays a prominent role in this area as well.  Most program material will be ingested from Avid Unity® and not controlled by the play-out automation system.  These files will require format conversion to the internal format of the transmission servers.  It is important that this process also writes the metadata required by the automation system so that it can recognize the material once it is ingested.  The automation system shall also be able to control a local VTR to ingest material directly into the transmission servers in the event of failure of either Avid or Contractor Provided transcoder.  

b. The middle applications such as  “automation” software which controls the hardware through machine control servers; “playlist” software which receives commands from both the traffic layer and the automation layer; performs monitoring & tracking function, “database and library” software; and other programs designed to mesh the different areas into a unified delivery system. Transcoding also occurs within this area.
 
c. The hardware  which actually performs transcoding, stores material and streams it to air. For the purposes of this document, playout servers may also be called channel servers, cache, edge, transmission or streaming servers. All storage configurations offered must offer seamless delivery of product in the event of a failure in any portion of the configuration.  It is important to note that total redundancy is a critical evaluation item. Downstream keyers and Character Generator are also located in this area.  Character generator will be used for onscreen messaging on a channel-selectable or all-channels basis. DSK will be used for channel branding.  Both shall be controlled either manually or through the playlist as scheduled events.

4.2.	System Reliability

Guaranteed reliability and protection of media and media delivery streams is a fundamental requirement.  All systems evaluated will be assessed against potential single-points of failure.  All systems will be judged as to the level of media protection, server protection, and software failsafes offered in the basic system.   



POINT OF CONTACT AND GSA PROJECT MANAGER FOR THIS REQUIREMENT IS MRS. KAREN BEYER.  ALL inquiries should be addressed to karen.beyer@gsa.gov.

This combined synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.  The Contract Type being considered for this award is a Firm-Fixed Price type contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 519190 with a corresponding qualifying size standard of $6,500,000 (indicates maximum allowed for a concern, including its affiliates, to be considered small).

The period of performance of the Base Period is from the date of contract award through one-year thereafter; Option Period 1 is through two-years after date of award; and Option Period 2 is through three-years after date of award. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies to this acquisition with the following addenda: Information required to be submitted with your quotation is listed below in two categories â€“ Technical Proposal and Price Proposal.  The prescribed information is required to be submitted with your offer in order to be considered for this requirement.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  Page limit -- Maximum of two one-sided pages, 12 point font minimum, single spaced, 1" margins, and when printed will fit on size 8 1/2" by 11" paper.  The technical discussion should clearly address the following:  Describe to what extent you can provide information for each of the areas listed in the CLINS and the Statement of Work.  PRICE PROPOSAL:  No Page Limit.  Pricing information should be clearly identified for each CLIN.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  The Government intends to award one contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal is responsive to the quotation and is determined to be the best value to the Government.  Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating each offerorâ€™ s quotation in accordance with the evaluation criteria below. The Technical Proposal is more important than the Price Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will be reviewed to determine the capability of the offeror to provide information in the areas listed in the Statement of Work.  The quality and relevance of the items submitted in the Technical Proposal will be evaluated.  Hence, it is important to present the information in a clear, convincing, and logical fashion.  The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior technical proposal than making an award at the lowest evaluated price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one quotation over another.  The Government may choose to discuss quotations with any or all offerors at any time prior to award of a contract for clarification or to seek better terms. The proposed cost will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism and adjustments may be made as necessary. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each offer.  All offers submitted in response to this quotation will be evaluated and scored. The provision at FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (MAR 2005) applies to this acquisition. Offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision.  If the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov., the offeror shall complete only paragraph (j) of this provision.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION 


1. Seeing Machines Pty Ltd GPO Box 782 Canberra ACT 2601 Australia, is the only known source that can satisfy the government's requirements (AFRL/HECV) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii). The requested equipment needs to be able to record eye, gaze, and head position on two screens without being mounted to the user’s head. The Seeing Machines system is desk mounted and has been shown to be the most robust system in a variety of research settings in industry and academia as well as US and Australia Defense departments. The objective is to record eye, gaze, and head positions of observers using two screens in the most naturalistic and least obtrusive way. The cost of having another company develop a similar system would be prohibitive. The alternative is to purchase a system that is head-mounted which is more obtrusive to the user. Other existing alternatives are also less capable than the Seeing Machines system. 
2. This procurement will be synopsized in accordance with FAR Part 5.

3.  The entire system will be purchased from Seeing Machines as per a quote from the POC Nick Langdale-Smith.

4. Therefore, it is hereby determined, Seeing Machines is the only source qualified to meet the government's requirements for this procurement.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Mettler Toledo, 1900 Polaris Parkway, Columbus, OH 43240 for the item listed below.  The requirement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.

(i) This is a combined/synopsis solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     
  
(ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-06-00267.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  

(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-11, July 5, 2006.

(iv) The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, Small Business Size Standard 500 Employees.  

 (v) The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting for the quantity of one (1) each for the following: 
 
¡ñ	Mettler Toledo FP84HT or equal Hot Stage Module with DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) capabilities 
which includes:  The Hot Stage must have a temperature range of at least ambient to 375C  and must accommodate transparent crucibles that allow microscopy during DSC scans; temperature flow sensors to support calorimetric measurements while performing microscopy with controlled temperature ramps; temperature controller must have a range of -60 to 400C, must have temperature ram rates covering range from 3.1 to 20C/minute, must allow the user to store up to 35 temperature programs and must support calibration by the user; The software must allow the user to control the temperature controlled by a Microsoft Windows compatible computer; The instrument must be complete with the exception of the computer and microscope and must include all firmware and cables required to install the instrument for operation on an Olympus BX51 Microscope; must supply user's manual, installation and basic training on the instrument.

JUSTIFICATION: The Government believes only one source manufactures a hot stage module with true differential scanning calorimetry capability.  Differential scanning calorimetry is based on measurement of heat flow between an empty reference pan and a full sample pan to determine the differential heat flow into the sample itself.  Mettler Toledo is believed to be the only vendor that manufactures a microscope hot stage with two pans, one a reference and the other a sample pan.  Our need require the Hot stage/DSC systems, not a single pan systems that require the user to run a blank scan, cool the pan, fill it with sample and then run a sample scan; as that process is less accurate than true DSC and presents several experimental challenges that will call the final results into question.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Upgrade to Nortel PBX
AS OF July 6, 2006


1.0 BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Defense Finance & Accounting Services Rome is to produce timely and accurate disbursements to the Department of Defense personnel, their dependants and commercial concerns. Automation support varies with in each directorate at all DFAS sites, but every function depends heavily upon telecommunications services to respond to customer needs.  DFAS needs to provide better customer service while reducing costs by upgrading the Nortel 61C Public Branch Exchange (PBX) at Rome.  Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (Rome Labs). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support. 
 
2.0 SCOPE:  The Nortel PBX at DFAS Rome requires an upgrade in order to meet Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) requirements.  DFAS Rome currently has a population of 564 personnel.  Rome’s population will increase by 436 more personnel due to BRAC realignment.  The Nortel 61C PBX is currently not a fully functional PBX. The contractor will provide equipment, software, and such technical support and training needed to install and implement the upgrade of the Nortel PBX to version 4.5 with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, and IP trunking capability.  The contractor will upgrade the frame relay room to required specifications needed to support the total population of DFAS Rome.  DFAS will provide some parts to offset costs.

                                  STATEMENT OF WORK
UNDERGROUND FUEL PIPELINE UTILITIES INVESTIGATION
NAVAL AIR STATION NORTH ISLAND SAN DIEGO, CA

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1	LOCATION

	Work is to be performed at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego CA.  

1.2	DESCRIPTION

The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Energy and Utilities Department is requesting an underground fuel pipeline mapping of two, JP-5, 10-inch pipelines; each pipeline is approximately 3.5 miles in length. NFESC is requesting this mapping as a result of inconclusive hydrostatic pressure tests on September 15, 2005 and September 16, 2005 under contract N47408-04-D-8503.  The required hydrostatic pressure test was unsuccessful due to air trapped inside the pipelines.  Venting the trapped air in the pipelines was not possible, because there are valve pits that can’t be located, valve handles in pits that are inoperable, and valve pit pipe risers with valves removed and capped. This investigation will MAP location and depth of each pipeline, location of vents, low point drains, and valve pits. The outcome of this investigation will determine the number and locations of vents required to successfully perform a hydrostatic test on each pipeline.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for nine scientific-grade, gated Intensified Charge-Coupled Device (ICCD) imaging systems capable of sub-microsecond imaging, and capable of acquiring multiple exposures on one image. Eight systems are required for use in the NASA Ames Hypervelocity Free-Flight Gun Development Facility (HFFGDF) to make time-critical free-flight aerodynamics measurements for a proposed NASA atmospheric entry vehicle (EV). Such aerodynamics measurements are made from time-resolved images of the position and orientation of a gun-launched model of the vehicle. This requires a short exposure time to freeze the model motion, a short time between exposures to resolve the model motion, a high resolution and dynamic range to resolve the model orientation, and precise timing control.  Specific system requirements are listed below. They preclude the use of high-speed video systems, which are incapable of obtaining both the required exposure rates and resolution and dynamic range. Instead, gated, intensified CCD cameras are needed to acquire multiple exposures, closely spaced in time, on a single image.  The eight camera systems must be simultaneously, and individually, controllable by and capable of transmitting data to a single, remotely-located personal computer. The Ames HFFGDF, equipped with these ICCD systems, provides a unique capability to NASA to obtain aerodynamics measurements on vehicles or projectiles flying complex (e.g., high-lift and/or high oscillation amplitude and frequency) trajectories. Such measurements were successfully made in the HFFGDF prior to the Space Shuttle return to flight to provide critical validation for CFD predictions of foam-debris trajectories. For the proposed NASA EV, CFD will form the bulk of the aerodynamics database, which will be used to run flight simulations and, ultimately, to be the basis for the in-mission guidance and control sequences used to fly the vehicle. The CFD, simulations, and guidance-and-control sequence development are all being carried out on an accelerated schedule. Obtaining the experimental data is critical to that schedule, and depends not only on having the ICCD cameras, but also on having the camera systems tested and integrated into the HFFGDF data-acquisition system.	Eight systems are required to provide two orthogonal views along the full trajectory path in the HFFGDF. The ninth ICCD system will be used to image the thermal radiation in the wavelength band from 550 nm to 850 nm emitted from the surface of projectiles moving at hypersonic speeds.  The radiation will be approximately like a gray body with emissivity around 0.6, and temperature above 800 K.  An exposure (gate width) between 0.1 microsecond and 1.0 microsecond is required to freeze the motion, depending on test conditions. The camera will acquire a single, snapshot, image of the projectile per experiment.  Image acquisition will be externally triggered by the arrival of the projectile in the field of view.  The external trigger signal will be generated by existing hardware, and will be TTL compatible. The camera will be deployed in the NASA Ames Hypervelocity Free-Flight Aerodynamic Facility (HFFAF) in support of the NASA ASMD Fundamental Aerodynamics program, Hypersonics project Specific requirements: (1) The system shall have a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) imaging sensor with a minimum resolution of 1024x1024 pixels and a maximum pixel pitch of 13.5 ƒÝm (micrometers).  (2) The system shall have a Gen III filmed image intensifier that is fiber-optically coupled to the CCD. (3) The intensifier shall have Quantum Efficiency greater than 35% over wavelengths from 550nm to 800nm and greater than 30% at 850nm. (4) The system shall be capable of an optical gate width as short as 5ns, full-width half-maximum (FWHM) and capable of a sustained gating repetition rate of at least 5kHz.   (5) The system shall be capable of ¡§burst mode¡¨ operation (i.e., multiple gating  occurs during acquisition of a single image), and a gating repetition, or burst rate (fixed per image) of at least 50 kHz is attainable.  (6) The system shall have a 16-bit digitizer.  (7) The system shall have a built-in timing generator that is remotely programmable, through software, to control gate width, delay, and frequency.  (8) The minimum delay shall be less than 50 ns. (9) The system shall accept an external TTL trigger source. (10) The timing generator shall provide timing outputs that allow the system to act as the timing master in time resolved experiments.  (11) The system shall be thermo-electrically cooled and capable of maintaining the imaging sensor at -20 ¢XC (absolute) without the use of water circulation.  (12) The camera shall be provided with an F-mount type optical mount.  (13) The system shall simultaneously be controlled by and transmit data to a personal computer (including a laptop without docking station) via a single USB 2.0 interface. (14) The system shall be provided with all necessary drivers and other control and data-acquisition software tools that are integrated with the National Instruments LabVIEW environment and allow full, concurrent operation of up to eight individual camera systems. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-08.

Request your company submit a proposal for this effort based upon the Statement of Work and supplemental information provided herein.

BEGINNING OF STATEMENT OF WORK:
GENERATION OF PUBLICATION 249, Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation, Volume 1 dated March 9, 2006

1.0  Objective
The NGA Maritime Division (PVM) is obligated under Title 10 of the United States Code to provide accurate and up-to-date nautical charts, publications, and databases.  To do so, the Maritime Division is required to populate, maintain, and make available various products related to Marine Safety. The objective under this contract is to generate the next edition of Pub 249, Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation Volume 1. It is imperative that the contractor fully understands the content and relationship of this database, where the data originated from and how it is used in the maritime arena.   Updates to this product are continuous and are made available to our customers worldwide. Access to this information is legally necessary for the mariner to safely keep charts and publications up-to-date. 

2.0  Scope
In order to complete the transition to providing all-digital publications, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency must continue to enhance the various publication datasets while deconflicting data as necessary.  Rather than simply supply the data in list form as is currently done with hard-copy publications, it is more advantageous for the mariner if this database is interlinked where possible and logical.  This will allow query access to data based on specific needs for safe navigation or mission planning.  The nature of the data requires a unique combination of a thorough nautical science background and extensive database experience in order to understand how the data is to be used and to validate formulas and solutions.

3.0  Performance Requirements
The Contractor shall perform all services required to satisfy the NGA requirements as listed in Section 3.2 and all additional tasks necessary to produce the modifications listed in this Statement of Work (SOW). The Contractor shall use an all-digital production system, which shall facilitate in-process and product quality assurance checks for the government and/or its agents.  

3.1 Government Furnished Materials
NGA may provide the following sources or some subset thereof:

Provide access to the public files and databases necessary to complete the job.
Provide a Technical Representative knowledgeable about the databases in question and the functionalities to be developed.
Furnish hard or softcopy editions on request of each publication that is to be accessed.  

3.2 Production

The Contractor shall be required to perform all tasks necessary to generate Publication 249 as defined below from the supplied Government Furnished Materials (GFM).
Publication 249 (Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation)
Assemble programs and algorithms to generate Pub 249 for the 2010 epoch.
Coordinate with the British Admiralty on the Introduction including text language, tables, and examples.
Generate CD display of Main Table.
Provide training and software support for a three-week period upon completion.

3.3 Production Status Reports
The Contractor shall provide a monthly status update, Production Status Report, due the first day of each month.  Reports shall include detailed information regarding the work accomplished for each production phase.  These reports may be sent via email in a PC-compatible format or reported on the vendor’s web site.  If the report is made available via a web site, web site access shall be granted to the NGA COR.  Report information shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
Contract number, award date, report date
Production unit identifiers (assignment phase)
Projected completion date for each phase
Percent complete by process/phase.
Narrative of issues, problems, open-action items, etc…

4.0  Deliverables 
Deliverables will include the following: electronic files of the translated text in Microsoft Word (rich text format) on CD-Rom or DVD, and/or hard copy text printed on 81/2” X 11” white bond paper printed in 10 pt. Courier New font.  The Contractor shall maintain backup copies of all data sets for 180 days after they have received acceptance notice from the COR.  A copy of the Production Status Report needs to be provided to the Contracting Officer (KO) and the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  The government shall retain restricted rights to the procedures, patents, software tools, and other methods developed to meet this contract for exclusive and unlimited use by government personnel. The government shall not share software, tools, and procedures with other contractors or with any non-government organizations.

5.0  Quality Assurance 

5.1 Quality Assurance Checks
The government will review, test, and verify all deliverables for format and content. It will be deemed unacceptable if it manifestly does not perform as specified in this contract. All future upgrades and enhancements to the software shall be made available to NGA as soon as released for use by the contractor, and will be reviewed, tested, and verified by NGA before acceptance.
     
5.2 Onsite Quality Assistance Visits (QAV) 
The Government, or its agent, may perform both in-process and final random statistical sampling quality assurance checks.  In process random statistical sampling quality assurance checks may occur during a production phase, and will be coordinated and scheduled as a QAV with the Contractor.  Final random statistical sampling quality assurance checks may also take place at the end of a production phase.  QAV for the verification of conformance to the Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) is to ensure compliance with the data requirements and may be performed at the facility of the Contractor or Subcontractor and/or NGA, or its agent.  While at the Contractor facility, the Contractor shall make available to the government, or its agent, the necessary items and hardware/software to conduct the random statistical sampling.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary production personnel to operate the system and assist during the QAV. The QAV will usually be no longer than one day, although there may be situations that require additional time at the Contractor's facility.  QAV and/or random statistical sampling quality assurance checks do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for non-conforming work that is detected after delivery.  If non-conforming work is discovered at any time prior to and after delivery, it is the responsibility of the Contractor to make the necessary corrections without further compensation from the government.  NGA may require regular meetings and communication with the Contractor to discuss production and technical issues (i.e. VTC, teleconference, and e-mail).

5.3 Data Acceptance
All deliverables shall conform to requirements stipulated in the SOW and all attachments.  Acceptance criteria must be understood and agreed upon by both the government and the Contractor prior to task order award, and written acceptance will be provided to the Contractor by NGA for all deliverables.  This however, does not preclude future mutually agreed upon modifications to the task order.  Final reviews may be performed at the contractor’s site or at NGA. NGA reserves the right to waive the on-site review.  Upon completion of a final delivery review by NGA, an assessment will be made as to the correction method to be used for the deliverable, if required.

5.4 Discrepancy Reports 
If the deliverables are unacceptable, NGA will return all of the deliverables for corrections, along with a Discrepancy Report (DRs).  These reports contain all of the data non-conformances.  All materials shall be returned to NGA at the Contractor’s expense.  Corrections will be made until NGA review personnel deem the library to be acceptable.

5.5 Timelines for Corrections
All correction timelines will commence on the day the contractor receives all necessary materials and the NGA Discrepancy Report.  The following data-specific timelines for fixing and returning necessary corrections will be used in determining the score for the schedule scoring section in the GGI Performance database.

6.0  Security Requirements
All contractor-supplied information shall be UNCLASSIFIED. There will be no need for access to classified information.  

7.0  Delivery Schedule
NGA will provide the contractor with a proposed delivery date with the source package.  The contractor will then notify the COR via electronic mail within 3 calendar days as to whether the proposed delivery date is acceptable or requires further negotiation.  Failure to notify the COR within 3 calendar days will constitute contractor agreement with the proposed delivery date.

The Government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive an exceptional past performance rating.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to access the offerors ability to performance the effort described in the RFQ, based on the offerors demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, neutral, marginal or unsatisfactory.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating neutral meaning the rating is treated neither favorably non unfavorably.  (c) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and evaluation process stops at that point.

(d) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  (e) The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in the best interest.

This combined synopsis/solicition is set aside 100% for small business.

Brief Description of Project (for entire Statement of Word please see announcement #7TF-06-0005SOW):

This Statement of work sets forth the requirements for an integrator to provide and install ten commercially available off-the-shelf multichannel NTSC television break-away/automation systems which are already currently offered for sale to commercial broadcasters and cable system operators.  Each of these systems shall playout eight independent channels and be scalable for future expansion.  These systems will enable American Forces Radio and Television Servcie (AFRTS) manned affiliates at ten geographically separated locations to automatically and manually insert commercial breaks (spot material) into network programming streams and provide long and short form programming throughout a broadcast day in the event that network feeds are lost.

Locations for this contract are:
	Operating Location-A, Detachment 4 AFNEWS, FELTWELL, England
	Detachment 6 AFNEWS, LAJES, Azores
	Detachment 7 AFNEWS, INCIRLIK, Turkey
	Detachment 8 AFNEWS, AVIANO, Italy
	Detachment 9 AFNEWS, SPANGDAHLEM, Germany
	Detachment 10 AFNEWS, YOKOTA (TOKYO), Japan
	Detachment 11 AFNEWS, OKINAWA, Japan
			Detachment 12 AFNEWS, MISAWA, Japan
			Detachment 13 AFNEWS, IWAKUNI, Japan
Detachment 14 AFNEWS, SASEBO, Japan
	 
Each of these locations receives primary programming from the Network headquarters, Defense Media Center-Broadcast Center (DMC-BC), Riverside, California via satellite service to Europe and the Pacific.  There exists in addition to the local automation requirement a requirement for transcoding of material using Anystream Agility to provide product to an automation system already owned by the Government and used in Germany.

4.1.	System Concept
The basic system concept is for the Television Break-away/Automation System to insert local spot breaks and News into the AFRTS program stream.  Schedules for each of the eight channels are provided by Network headquarters, also referred to as the DMC-BC, 3-5 days in advance and indicate the break times or “avails” in which to insert local products. Local manipulation of the scheduled breaks does not normally occur. For the purposes of this document the terms “spot”, “product”, “interstitial material”, “short form” or “long form”  are synonymous in that they refer to television program material produced or recorded in-house for air at a later time.

Our simplified TV automation concept for this award covers three main areas of functionality. 

a.	The Playlist Management System, residing at the User layer, which interfaces to the AFRTS Network schedules. It also plans schedules,  provides reports, and controls the automation software. Ingest plays a prominent role in this area as well.  Most program material will be ingested from Avid Unity® and not controlled by the play-out automation system.  These files will require format conversion to the internal format of the transmission servers.  It is important that this process also writes the metadata required by the automation system so that it can recognize the material once it is ingested.  The automation system shall also be able to control a local VTR to ingest material directly into the transmission servers in the event of failure of either Avid or Contractor Provided transcoder.  

b. The middle applications such as  “automation” software which controls the hardware through machine control servers; “playlist” software which receives commands from both the traffic layer and the automation layer; performs monitoring & tracking function, “database and library” software; and other programs designed to mesh the different areas into a unified delivery system. Transcoding also occurs within this area.
 
c. The hardware  which actually performs transcoding, stores material and streams it to air. For the purposes of this document, playout servers may also be called channel servers, cache, edge, transmission or streaming servers. All storage configurations offered must offer seamless delivery of product in the event of a failure in any portion of the configuration.  It is important to note that total redundancy is a critical evaluation item. Downstream keyers and Character Generator are also located in this area.  Character generator will be used for onscreen messaging on a channel-selectable or all-channels basis. DSK will be used for channel branding.  Both shall be controlled either manually or through the playlist as scheduled events.

4.2.	System Reliability

Guaranteed reliability and protection of media and media delivery streams is a fundamental requirement.  All systems evaluated will be assessed against potential single-points of failure.  All systems will be judged as to the level of media protection, server protection, and software failsafes offered in the basic system.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD: Justification For Other than Full And Open Competition
				      RFQ # F3B7AK6170A400

FROM: 423 ABS/LGC Contracting Flight
	 PSC 47 Box 5720
	 APO AE 09470   

SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification for Rotator Assembly, Antenna Products Corp. Item # LPH-89

1. The 422 Communications Squadron (RAF Croughton, United Kingdom) Cable Antenna Maintenance shop requires a rotator assembly manufactured by Antenna Products Corp. as listed in the subject line above. The total estimated cost of the rotator assembly and shipping from the United States is known to the Government. This information is subject to “For Official Use Only” restrictions prior to award of a contract.

2. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1 there is only one known responsible source for this particular item. There are no other known suppliers or substitute products that can satisfy the current requirement. Acquisition of the required item under other than full and open competition is hereby authorized unless the Government receives a responsive offer after posting the required notification (RFQ) on the Federal Business Opportunities website.

3. The requesting agency has made every effort to locate alternate products or sources for this rotator assembly, and to date Antenna Products Corp. is the only known source qualified to furnish the required item, thereby requiring the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to authorize a sole source acquisition.

4. The 423 ABS Contracting Office has taken the following steps to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable: using research tools available on the Internet to locate and solicit at least  three sources, and asking Antenna Products Corp. if they have any authorized dealers or re-sellers for their products.  The requesting party has also furnished data from the Technical Orders for the end items to verify that only one specific make and model of rotator assembly is acceptable for use on the antenna system. The appropriate notification of this requirement will be publicized by posting a combined synopsis/solicitation on the Federal Business Opportunities website for at least ten days.

5. The anticipated cost to the Government is considered fair and reasonable. This determination was made based on a recent purchase order for an identical item under contract FA5570-06-P-0023.

6. Market research conducted to date included verification from the appropriate Air Force depot level item manager for the end item supported that only one manufacturer and item number are acceptable for use. This was verified by looking at the technical order data to see if other manufacturers or alternate products are authorized for use on the antenna system. As stated in Paragraph 4 above, the requesting individual also used Internet resources to locate any other possible sources for the specific item required or possible acceptable substitutes. The results of market research efforts verified that there only appears to be one known source for the required rotator assembly.

7. Technical data and specifications have been furnished by the requesting party. The technical data did not indicate that there are suitable substitute products other than the specified make and model manufactured by Antenna Products Corp. The purchase request included sufficient descriptive information to attempt full and open competition.

8. The following firms were asked to provide quotes for the required rotator assembly: Antenna Products. Corp. and Rotor Doc.com. Only Antenna Products provided a quote. 

9. At present the only known barrier to competition is that there is only one known source as based on US Air Force knowledge of the end item supported. The depot level manager has indicated that these antennas are being de-commissioned throughout the Air Force, but that the Navy or Coast Guard may have assets in stock available for inter-service support. The 423 ABS Contracting Flight will attempt to find points of contact with the sister services while the requirement is solicited on the Federal Business Opportunities website.

10. I certify that this justification for other than full and open competition for the purchase of one rotator assembly as manufacture by Antenna Products Corp. (USAF Technical Order part number 0002-6569-401, Antenna Products Corp. item # LPH-89) is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

11. I certify as complete and accurate the supporting data and technical requirements stated above. I understand this forms a basis for justification of other than full and open competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”.

MEMORANDUM FOR Prospective Offerors
 
FROM	99 CONS/LGCB
		5865 SWAAB BLVD
		NELLIS AFB NV  89119


SUBJECT:	Site Visit for F22A Tail Maintenance Stand
 
1.	The following personnel were present at the site visit held at 57 EMS:
			NAME				ORGANIZATION/COMPANY
2Lt Amy Ciaravolo, Contracting Officer		99 CONS/LGCB
Laurie Banks, Contract Specialist			99 CONS/LGCB
TSgt Chris Tahtinen				57 EMS
Richard Frye					57 EMS
Linda Formica					All Metal MS
Bill McNiff					All Metal MS
Allen Shipes					DAE Industries Inc.
Bruce Grassano					Container Research
Dan Adams					CVI
Mark Riker					CVI
Thomas Spika					PLI
Fredrick L. Piclo					PLI

2.  The meeting was convened at the hanger where the F22A was located.  Introductions and sign-ins were accomplished.  Ms Banks explained that they could talk to the technical representatives, take measurements and ask questions; however, she encouraged the offerors hold most of their questions until we meet in a conference after the physical visit.
3.	The physical viewing of the F22A was held in the painting booth where maintenance, etc. is conducted on the aircraft.  This allowed the offerors to see the limited space and measurements where the maintenance stand will be utilized.  The following areas were covered by the technical personnel at the viewing:
a.	The problem is getting the stand in from the side.  The stand needs to come in from the side of the aircraft instead of from the back.  
b.	The platform should be wide enough to cover the base from the bottom to the top.  It should be about 124”.
c.	The tail slants and the stand need to conform to this difference.
d.	When there is no fuel and the engines have been removed the plane can stand about 15” higher.
e.	The government wants the platform to go low as possible so they can work underneath and also the top of the plane.
f.	Needs to be to be shorter than 139” when lowered so that it can be rolled away from the aircraft.
g.	It should not be any longer than 8’ so it does not obstruct the door/exits.

4.	During the meeting in the conference the following areas were covered:

a.	Don’t complicate the stand.  Do not provide too many moving parts.  The government is in the business to maintain aircraft not maintenance stands.  Simple is good.  Simple hydraulics.

b.	The base should be about 124”.  Be careful of depth of the platform.  A lot of tools are normally used when working on the plane and usually they are kept on the platform.  There also needs to be room enough for at least two people to maneuver.

c.	The tail is canted 48”.

d.	Need stand to rise up and down be prefer that it is not powered.  Durable but simple is preferred.  Prefer manual lowering and lifting.

e.	Material is steel.  Do not like aluminum because it is not sturdy enough.  Current stands for the most part are green (forest/olive drab).

f.	Prefer closed/sold grates on the platform and stairs.  This helps items from falling through to the ground.

g.	Air in the paint booth moves front to back not side to side.

 5. If you have any further questions please contact Laurie Banks (702-652-9578).

Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (Rome Labs). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support.

RFQ;  FFP;    LINE ITEM 0001:
                                  STATEMENT OF WORK
UNDERGROUND FUEL PIPELINE UTILITIES INVESTIGATION
NAVAL AIR STATION NORTH ISLAND SAN DIEGO, CA

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1	LOCATION

	Work is to be performed at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego CA.  

1.2	DESCRIPTION

The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Energy and Utilities Department is requesting an underground fuel pipeline mapping of two, JP-5, 10-inch pipelines; each pipeline is approximately 3.5 miles in length. NFESC is requesting this mapping as a result of inconclusive hydrostatic pressure tests on September 15, 2005 and September 16, 2005 under contract N47408-04-D-8503.  The required hydrostatic pressure test was unsuccessful due to air trapped inside the pipelines.  Venting the trapped air in the pipelines was not possible, because there are valve pits that can’t be located, valve handles in pits that are inoperable, and valve pit pipe risers with valves removed and capped. This investigation will MAP location and depth of each pipeline, location of vents, low point drains, and valve pits. The outcome of this investigation will determine the number and locations of vents required to successfully perform a hydrostatic test on each pipeline.

2.0	SCOPE

2.1	GENERAL

The Contractor shall provide all necessary qualified personnel, equipment and materials to map the underground fuel pipelines and document findings.  

2.2	PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

The AutoCAD drawings will be on CD and paper form.  The drawings will identify, but not limited to, the location, slope and depth of each pipeline, and the appurtenances (valve pits, valves, riser vents, and low point riser drains).   The current system has 15 manhole covers that are damaged or cannot be located. 

NFESC will be present to assess the internal piping and valves at those locations. 

3.0	GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION (GFI)

The following information will be furnished to the Contractor with this Statement of Work.  All GFI shall be returned at the completion of the project.

<DESC>This solicitation is modified to answer questions: 
1.      Under “proposed personnel” are you looking for titles or people’s names? 

Titles and Resumes

2.      The solicitation states the cost proposal “must include time and material costs for each deliverable.”  The list of deliverables includes documented functional specifications and requirements in accordance with OPM Information Technology Systems Management (ITSM), “a copy of which will be provided”; documented operating procedures as set forth by the government build team; organized/facilitated meetings; and reports of issues discussed/points made in user group meetings. It would be difficult to put a cost to these items as we haven’t seen the ITSM, the build team procedures, and do not know how long the meetings will run or what issues they will generate.  Can you provide guidance on preparing a cost proposal. 

-- Functional specifications and requirements under the ITSM follow a standardized System Development Lifecycle methodology of documentation that can be used as a reference template.

-- Documented operating procedures would be similar to industry best practices for documenting functional operating procedures for a dashboard system.

-- Facilitate meetings/report issues from user group meetings; estimate quarterly user group meetings and base on best practices.

CLOSING DATE AND TIME HAVE NOT BEEN EXTENDED.

PROPOSALS - Technical Proposal: Submit original and two copies containing the following: Management plan, proposed personnel, sample of similar work produced and operating in a dashboard environment, references of customers worked with in gathering functional requirements, and experience in the investigative process with references for gathering functional requirements.  Cost Proposal: The cost proposal must include time and material costs for each deliverable.

PROPOSAL EVALUATION - Technical Evaluation: Offerors will be evaluated in terms of the quality and relevance of information presented against the factors indicated below.  These criteria are listed in descending order of importance: Demonstrated working knowledge of FISD processes and procedures as well as knowledge of FISD Personnel Investigations Processing System (PIPS) and standard Management Information reports: Management and staffing; demonstrated knowledge and samples of work in documentation of a dashboard system, user’s instructions and validation testing performed on similar functional- type systems; and past performance.  Cost Evaluation: We will evaluate your price proposal, not only to determine whether the price is reasonable, but also to determine your understanding of the performance work statement and your ability to meet the objectives and scope of this RFP.  Price, while less important that the previously listed factors will become more critical as technical scores approach equality.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION - Security Requirements - All Contractor employees and subcontractors engaged in the performance of work under this contract must have a completed, current investigation that qualifies them for secret-level clearance.  No personnel may perform any work under this contract until specific permission is granted by OPM to do so, regardless of clearance.  The Contractor and any subcontractor(s) shall comply with: 
a. The Security Agreement, including the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DOD 5220.22-M) and the FISD Security Manual and any revisions to these manuals. OPM will notify the Contractor of any such revisions. 
b. Although the NISPOM does not specifically include instructions for handling Sensitive material, the guidelines for Confidential and Secret material will be followed.
c. If the security classification or security requirements are changed by the Government subsequent to the date of this contract, and if the changes cause an increase or decrease in security costs or otherwise affect any other term or condition of this contract, any resulting financial burden will be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. 
d. The Contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause in all subcontracts under this contract that involve access to classified information.
Except as otherwise specifically provided, any information made available to the Contractor by the Government will be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract. It will not be divulged or made known in any manner to any persons except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract or other OPM approved system.  In performance of this contract, the Contractor assumes responsibility for protection of the confidentiality of Government records and will ensure that its subcontractors will also protect the confidentiality of Government records.  The Each officer or employee of the Contractor or any of its subcontractors with access to any Government record will be notified in writing by the Contractor that information disclosed to such officer or employee can only be used for the purpose and to the extent authorized by this contract. Further disclosure of any such information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized by this contract, may be subject to criminal sanctions under 18 U.S.C. 641. That section of the criminal code of the United States provides that whoever knowingly converts to their own use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys, or disposes of any record of the United States or whoever receives the same with the intent to convert it to their use or gain, knowing it to have been converted, shall be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment of up to ten years or both.
 
CONTRACT AWARD: A contract will be awarded to the Offeror that is determined to offer the best value to the OPM considering primarily the results of the technical evaluation and secondarily, the total estimated cost for providing all services described in this solicitation.  Proposals must be received by the Office of Personnel Management no later than 3:00 p.m. on July 28, 2006 at the above address.

<DESC>This Amendment does not change the date that offers are due. The purpose of this Amendment is to (A) replace language in section 11.0 of the Statement of Work in 06PR-TDP-312; and, the purpose of this amendment is to (B) post answers to questions regarding the solicitation.

(A) Remove and replace:

Remove from section 11.0
A time and material contract award is anticipated.

Replace with
A firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contract award is anticipated.

(B)

Questions and answers as of May 25, 2006:

Question #1

Will a team that includes subcontractors with specialized expertise be considered?

Answer: Yes. A team that includes subcontractors will be considered.

Question #2

Must any of the team members be located in the Washington D.C. area? If the team lead is available to travel to D.C. as required, can the majority of the work (writing, media contact, etc.) be done virtually?

Answer: No person is required to be located in Washington DC. However, the duties of the position (see 5.5 of Statement of Work) sometimes require the contractor to be in Washington DC. It is estimated that the contractor will need to be in Washington D.C. 12 to 15 times per year.

Question #3

Does the annual report entail any design, or is it strictly text and data?

Answer: The annual report is more than text and data. I would recommend that you look to the IRS Oversight Board web site for examples. (www.treas.gov/irsob)

Question #4

How long is the annual report and what type of format is typically produced?

Answer: The last three annual reports have been 2005 (48), 2004 (49), and 2003 (30) pages long. Examples of the format produced can be found on the IRS Board web site previously referenced.

Question #5

Should travel expenses be incorporated into the proposal, or should expenses be estimated separately and billed at cost?

Answer: Travel expenses should be incorporated into the proposal and Travel should be reimbursed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. The applicable regulations can be found at www.gsa/ftr.gov .

Question #6

Is there a preferred format in which you would like to receive our response to this bid?
 
Answer: There is no preferred format for the response. Please see FAR 52.212-1 for instructions for offerors.

Question #7

Do we need to provide estimated costs for the 4 option years?

Answer: Yes.

Question #8

Should past performance references be federal government agencies or, since my company has not worked for the federal government before, will other client references be accepted?

Answer: Past performance references are not restricted to federal government agencies. All references will be evaluated.

Question #9

I would also be interested in learning when you expect to make a decision and award a contract, if you have that information and can you share it. 

Answer: There is no definitive date set for decision and award. Under simplified acquisition procedures, unsuccessful offerors are not required to be notified. (See FAR 13.106-3) If you desire to be notified, please request notification in writing.

Question #10

How many “additional reports”, as stated in the solicitation, are expected?

Answer: The number of additional reports varies from year to year. Due to the difficulty in predicting circumstances that may warrant a need to produce an additional report, any response to this question would be mere speculation; and, therefore no number will be provided. Reports that were completed in past years are available on the IRS Oversight Board web site.

Question #11

Will you need assistance in planning/producing the Board meetings, either within the Oversight Board’s offices or those held elsewhere?

Answer: The statement of work contained in the body of the combined synopsis/solicitation details the responsibility of the contractor regarding Board meetings.

Question #12

Question #11
Will you need assistance in planning/producing the Board meetings, either within the Oversight Board’s offices or those held elsewhere?
Answer: The statement of work contained in the body of the combined synopsis/solicitation details the responsibility of the contractor regarding Board meetings.
Question #12 
Will Contractors be given an opportunity to meet with the Program Officer?
Answer: No
Question #13
Will select Contractors be given an opportunity to present their proposal and examples of their work in person?

 meet with the Program Officer?

Answer: No

Question #13

Will select Contractors be given an opportunity to present their proposal and examples of their work in person?

Answer: No Contractor, select or otherwise, will be given an opportunity to present their proposal beyond their submission as required in the solicitation.

Question #14

Are you looking for an hourly rate and estimate of time and materials on deliverables mentioned? I would imagine that we would include an hourly rate for any additional work that falls outside of this scope. If this be the case, then I would presume that you aren't looking for a "firm fixed price" quotation? 

Answer:  The solicitation is for commercial items which require a firm fixed price contract per the Federal Acquisition Regulation; therefore any quote should reflect this requirement.

Question #15

“Generic” I think there may be something that can be done better or additionally in the requirement. Should I propose this?

Answer: Your quote should reflect the requirements of the solicitation. However, you are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the Government’s requirement with the understanding that the Government will select the offer that is most advantageous, price and other factors considered. See FAR 52.212-1 & -2

Question #16

Should the proposal include print management and cost of printing? Or just the cost for us to manage printing with print cost being separate and quoted once piece is designed?

Answer: Printing is done by the Department of Treasury; but the contractor develops the specifications for printing, including type of paper, use of color, binding, quantify, and other parameters of the job. The actual cost of printing is not borne by the contractor.

4.0	GENERAL INFORMATION
4.1	The contractor shall be responsible for the performance of the work and to perform all contractor-related administrative functions.  
4.2	Privacy Act and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
4.2.1	Privacy Act.  Work on this project may require that personnel have access to Privacy Information.  Personnel shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552a and applicable agency rules and regulations. (Appendix A)
4.2.2	HIPAA.  The contractor will ensure that all requirements of HIPAA are complied in conjunction with privacy requirements and with the Mission Assurance Categories I, II, and III controls for integrity and availability for applying integrated, layered protection of DoD information systems and networks per Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 85000.2, 6 Feb 03, E4, attachments 1-3 and DoD 6025.18-R (reference Appendix B).  In addition, HIPAA requirements will be complied with concerning the Security of Protected Health Information (reference Appendix B).
4.2.3	Security.  The contractor shall adhere to security as required within this SOW.  Work, performed under this contract, is unclassified.  This contract requires adherence to security/privacy requirements imposed by the Government, DoD, AF and other applicable security clearance requirements as applicable to this contract.  When required, all documentation required for the maintenance of security requirements shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  The IDSCAT program does not have any health-related data included that is associated with personal identifiers and/or the programs interface with other health care data systems.  At no time in the delivery of the IDS-CAT survey is the user login-password ever paired with personal identifying information; the login and passwords are randomly distributed; sensitive health-related questions are not asked. In this sense, it is truly completely anonymous and private for the respondent.  However, to ensure that if this circumstance changes, the Government requires the inclusion of the Privacy Act Sensitive requirement.  The contractor shall handle and protect all data as directed and implemented by the AFMS enterprise and its implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA).  (Appendix B)  The COTR must be kept abreast of all security issues dealing with the security clearances and/or certifications. 
4.2.3	Security Requirement.  Although contractor’s work does not conflict with Government security, the contractor shall be eligible to meet the National Agency Check (NAC)/Eligibility of A1S2 clearance.  Meeting the National Agency Check (NAC)/Eligibility of A1S2 clearance is not required prior to beginning work since contractor does not have access to patient data but may be requested and documentation provided to this effect.  
4.3	Quality Control
4.3.1	The contractor will develop a quality control plan for Government review.
4.3.2	The contractor shall be responsible for quality control for all work accomplished during the performance of this contract.  All work shall be accomplished using the best commercial practices and be within the Government guidelines.
4.4	Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The contractor shall comply with Section 508 and maintain the documentation that demonstrates this compliance, when applicable.  All electronic and information technology procured through this contract must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1194, unless an agency exception to this requirement exists.  36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended and is viewable at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm.  
4.5	Product Ownership.  At the completion or termination of this contract the Government will own all products with unlimited rights at no additional cost, monetary or otherwise.  All data and patent data collected as part of this application and database belongs exclusively to the US AFMSA PHSD.  The Federal Government product ownership will include all of the following that may apply: 1) if commercial software was used, the data layout or schema; 2) if a commercial product isn’t used the source code or un-compiled code or programming code and what language it is written in; and, 3) if a commercial product was not used, the compiled (“executable”) program and the manual and/or instructions regarding this programming; and 4) the test plans used.
