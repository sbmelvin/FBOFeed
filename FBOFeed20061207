<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ) OR AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB)NOR IS IT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. IAW FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1) - Soliciting from a single source, NASA/Kennedy Space Center (KSC) intends to enter into a sole source procurement of the following services from Boeing, Huntington Beach CA:  Item:01 Qty:1	 Description: Dissimilar Metal Testing (see below Statement of Work) The referenced Boeing services are determined to be the sole source capable to meet the Government requirement of compatibility with the ongoing joint NASA/DoD Non-Chrome Systems for Aviation and Aerospace Applications Project. Full and open competition is impractical for the following reasons:  I. Specialized knowledge of Boeing. A. Boeing has specialized knowledge as they developed the dissimilar metals test for use on their commercial aircraft.  This knowledge includes: - A Boeing test procedure that allows for continuity of test results.  - Broad range of experience conducting the dissimilar metals tests that provide a high degree of reliability in the test results. - The unique ability to analyze test results and compare them to prior Boeing results that can then be applied to NASA applications with a higher degree of certainty.  - NASA has recognized the Boeing Dissimilar Metals Test as a standard to be used wherever possible in NASA Programs.  This test has been widely accepted within the aerospace community and testing by a source other than Boeing could necessitate an extensive re-qualification process.  This could result in a significant increase in time and cost in order to gain the specialized knowledge already achieved by Boeing.	This would result in unacceptable costs, delays, and inefficiencies in the support of Agency Programs. II. Boeing has proven track record and lessons learned from previous support to NASA. A. Boeing has obtained knowledge of ways to avoid/handle issues arising in this type of testing. These lessons learned have only been gained by extensive experience performing dissimilar metals and will assure quality results are delivered. Statement of Work: 1.0 PURPOSE The purpose of this task is to provide dissimilar metals testing to support an ongoing joint NASA/DoD project.  The project is being developed and managed through the NASA Acquisition Pollution Prevention (AP2) Office located at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida.  These services will be performed in accordance with this Statement of Work (SOW).	Project task modifications/additions will be approved by the Contracting Officer. 2.0 OBJECTIVE This SOW identifies the tasks to be performed by the Contractor. This project is a joint NASA and Air Force project aimed at evaluating novel non-chromated coating systems for the unique performance environments of space flight and military operations.  The project team is comprised of representatives from KSC and other DOD agencies. 3.0 PERFORMANCE EXPECTATION In keeping with performance based contracting requirements, timeliness and quality will be the primary performance measurement criteria.  Contract deliverables, as delineated herein, will be considered timely if received on or before the dates required.	Quality will be determined by thoroughness of content, concise and professional presentation.  Electronic submittal of deliverables is the preferred media.   4.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE The period of performance shall not exceed 12 months from the effective date of the purchase order. 5.0 TASKS 5.1 The Contractors shall perform dissimilar metals testing on six coating systems provided by NASA according to test requirements found in DMS 1786 and DMS 2144 from the Douglas Hertitage specifications.   5.2 Contractor shall coordinate with the NASA point of contact listed in paragraph 7.0 the transfer of the six coatings systems to be used for testing from NASA to the Contractor’s facility. 6.0 DELIVERABLES 6.1 The Contractor shall summarize the results of the testing in the form of a final report no later than 30 after testing is completed.  6.2 The Contract shall deliver the final report via electronic mail to the NASA point of contact listed in paragraph 7.0 7.0 NASA POINTS OF CONTACT NASA ACQUISITION POLLUTION PREVENTION  (AP2) PROGRAM MANAGER Ms. Christina Brown National Aeronautics and Space Administration John F.

<DESC>Product Improvements for the BQM-167A Subscale Aerial Target - The Air Armament Center, Air-to-Air Missile Systems Wing, Aerial Targets Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL intents to award a sole source modification to Composite Engineering Inc., located at 5381 Raley Blvd, Sacramento, CA 92632 for the development efforts to upgrade their systems engineering program, enhance system maintainability and the ability of the BQM-167A to meet operational performance objectives not attainable in the baseline target configuration and for support to BQM-167A pre-operational ground and flight test activities.  Improvements anticipated by the Government include recovery system maintainability enhancements, launch phase improvements, radar cross section augmentation and reliability growth.  Maintainability improvements include, but are not limited to, reduction of resources and schedule required for recovery system preparation for flight.  The BQM-167A parachute configuration, driven by the heavy weight target launch configuration, takes significantly longer to prepare and pack than legacy subscale target systems impacting availability and supportability.  A study to identify alternatives to reduce this maintenance impact without adversely impacting the target survivability during recovery is anticipated with a follow-on development, integration, and test activity to verify operation and maintenance performance of the selected alternative.  Improvements in the system to ensure consistent target system performance during the launch phase of the flight will also be pursued.  This effort is expected to include design modifications to the BQM-167A launch rail, as well as, on-target Rocket Assisted Take-Off (RATO) bottle attachment equipment in order to achieve consistent performance during target departure from the rail and during RATO separation from the target.  In addition, the launch phase improvements will include an effort to enhance the robustness of the launch phase portion of the BQM-167A flight simulator.  Under reliability growth a study to assess the target design and determine opportunities to increase system reliability and follow-on development, integration, and test activities to incorporate and verify selected system design changes is planned.  Finally, support to Government conducted pre-operational ground and flight test activities, including participation in test planning, test conduct, and data analysis, will be required.  Completion of these tasks is required prior to October 2007.  A Government-owned technical data package of the baseline AFSAT design does not exist to provide interested parties for use in these development efforts. The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees. Composite Engineering Inc. is the prime contractor for the current AFSAT contract and has been since the inception of the program in 2002.  The government has determined that the only way to minimize the adverse impact to the critical mission activities requiring continuous availability of sub-scale aerial targets is to issue a modification to the existing contract to the incumbent vendor. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort.

<DESC>The Military Sealift Command (MSC) is improving the capabilities of the T-AH 19 Class hospital ships to provide humanitarian support.  A significant component of this will be the addition of two tender boats (one each port and starboard).  The tender boats will provide passenger and patient transfer between the hospital ship and locations inaccessible to large vessels.

To conserve weather deck space, two existing open-topped lifeboats and their associated davits will be removed to provide deck space for the tender boats and their davits.  To compensate for the resulting reduction in overall lifeboat capacity, the tender boats will be required to serve in the dual role of tender and lifeboat.  

MSC plans to issue a requirement for one (1) ship set, with an option for one (1) additional ship set, of combination cruise tender/lifeboats.  A ship set is defined as two (2) combination cruise tender/lifeboats, two (2) SOLAS lifeboat davits, and two (2) SOLAS lifeboat winches.  The estimated issue date for the solicitation is 9 January 2007.  The solicitation will be posted to the MSC website (http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil/procurement/contract/RFPSearchEntry.jsp).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent, to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI7028).  This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC05-08.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure maintenance services for the terrazzo marble floor in our BLDG. 40 facility, which is located on the National Institutes of Health campus.  This service will be required on a monthly basis.  This service is being procured on a sole source basis using Simplified Acquisition procedures, with the Stuart Dean Company.  Stuart Dean is an accredited founding member of the Marble Institute of America (MIA) and the International Association of Stone Restoration and Conservation (IASRAC).  Their processes and proprietary methods are accepted by the above, routinely outperform the competition and are of higher quality and achieve longer lasting results.  Stuart Dean is also a participatory member of the American Society of Testing Materials and is asked to test products and systems for the regulatory body.  Stuart Dean is a National Associate Member of BOMA (Building Owners and Managers Association) International.  They have provided maintenance in Bldg. 40 facility for the past 4 Years.  This is not a small business Set-Aside.  The requirement consists of the following: 1) monthly maintenance of over 4,200 square feet of terrazzo marble in 1st floor public area: 2) elevator lobby; 3) steps leading to North rotunda entrance; 4) landing at base of stairs; 5) areas to be refinished will be completely masked and covered with protective paper and plastic to ensure integrity of delicate finishes adjacent to marble, such as bronze and wood; 6) all light to medium scratches will be removed using abrasive means including resin-bonded diamond pads and sand screens in conjunction with a weighted floor machine; 7) a powdered mixture of oxalic acid, aluminum oxide and water will be used as a polishing compound under a 19 inch natural fiber-polishing pad; 8) once even polished is achieved, all polishing slurry will be removed by use of a water vacuum, followed by a two-step neutralizing process achieved by flooding the polished area with ph balanced stone soap; 9) vitrification or crystallization of marble will be performed to improve the floors, slip co-efficient and enhance the hardness of shine, per manufacturer's specifications utilizing specially low-rotation floor machine and #2 Texsteel steel wool pads.  The scope of the work is to restore the luster and sheen of the floor material by adherence to methodology developed by the Marble Institute of America and the International Association of Stone Restoration and Conservation.  Workers skilled in vitrification process are a mandatory requirement.  Depending on the extent of the wear, the requirements might include polishing with abrasive compounds and vitrification of the surface.  It is critical that the thickness of the marble be minimized as the marble is ground during the polishing process.  The marble is only a fraction of an inch thick, and serious repercussions could arise regarding the longevity of the floor.  It is critical that only an experienced, high-quality firm perform this work.  The Period of Performance will be January 2007 - December 2007.  The North American Industry Classification System Code Number 238990 and the Small business Set-Aside is 12.0 million.  The FOB point shall be Destination.  This will be a firm-fixed price contract.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations provisions and clauses apply to the acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; Far 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications Commercial Items; Far 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; Far 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.406-7 Central Contractor Registration (2003).  A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representation and Certifications Commercial Items must be included which can be found at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) https://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

The Bureau of the Public Debt (Public Debt) is assessing the market to evaluate costing for a commercial magnetic tape conversion service.  The service will be used in conjunction with BPD's continuity of operations program (COOP).  Archival data recorded on tapes may be needed either when BPD declares a disaster, or is conducting a COOP test.  However, those tapes are recorded on media that is not compatible with tape drives to be installed at the COOP processing site.

As the need arises, archived tapes would be shipped by BPD to the service vendor's site, where the tapes would be converted to compatible media, and shipped by the vendor to BPD's COOP site.  BPD would exercise the service annually, at a minimum, with an annual test consisting of no more than 5 tapes to be converted and shipped to the alternate processing site.

The tapes to be converted are recorded on STK 9840 tapes and 3490E compatible tapes, written on a z/900 mainframe running the z/OS operating system.  The target media is IBM 3592 tape.  

The proposed solution(s) must have the following capabilities and features:
 
Read and write magnetic tapes written on a z/900 mainframe running the z/OS operating system.
Copy data on STK 9840 tapes to IBM 3592 tapes.
Copy data on 3490E compatible tapes to IBM 3592 tapes.
Provide shipping of converted tapes to BPD's alternate processing site.
Security Concerns

BPD is requesting technical product literature that will demonstrate the vendor's ability to meet the specified requirements, commercial price lists (if available), and references (agency name, point of contact, and phone number) only, at this time.  However, at BPD's option, a demonstration of the process, and/or technical presentations may be requested from vendors responding to this announcement. BPD will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received.  Dependent upon the results of this market survey, BPD may subsequently issue a solicitation to acquire the appropriate service.  Any such solicitation would be based on a strictly functional statement of requirements in order to maximize competition.  

The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested.  BPD will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received.  Information sent in response to this request shall be emailed to psb1@bpd.treas.gov no later than December 12, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Please note that no Synopsis/Solicitation document is available at this time.

<DESC>The Office of Clinical Research Affairs (OCRA) of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to recompete a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in infectious diseases.  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE,  NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period with performance beginning on or about March 3, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 40.75 FTEs.    

The NIAID, DMID supports extramural research to understand and ultimately prevent and/or treat diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than HIV that threaten millions of lives every year.  This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  DMID is also responsible for advancing clinical research and conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic agents against potential bioterrorist pathogens and new and re-emerging infectious diseases of public health importance, such as avian influenza and SARS.    

The primary goal of this seven-year effort is to facilitate the evaluation of new vaccines, other prophylactic strategies, and therapeutic agents for infectious diseases of priority to the Division.  Support will be provided for single- and multi-center Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials of vaccines, other biologics, therapeutic agents aimed at bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases that occur in people of all ages at DMID-sponsored Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) and other clinical research centers.  The contractor's primary goal will be to coordinate clinical trials with respect to elements of study planning and logistics, training and communications, data collection, management and analysis and related support activities.  This will typically involve a multi-center effort and a collaborative relationship with clinical investigators, other supporting contractors and DMID staff.  

The support services to be provided by the contractor under this contract include the following: 1) computerized systems for the collection, management, storage, security, reporting and quality control of study data including systems to accommodate on-line subject enrollment and randomization; 2) statistical expertise in study design and analysis of trials; 3) assistance with preparation of study-related materials such as Manuals of Operations, case report forms and/or source documents and tracking logs; 4) development and maintenance of protocol web sites to share information and study materials with study sites and to provide DMID with real-time study information, such as overall and site-specific accrual, demographics, adverse events, queries, and deviations; 5) development and maintenance of an electronic inventory system to identify and track clinical study specimens; 6) providing training to clinical site staff to access the data system, perform remote data entry and enter clinical specimens into the electronic inventory system; 7) assessing capabilities and providing assistance to sites that intend to perform their own data collection, management, security and quality control; and 8) serving as a repository to store data from completed studies.

The Request for Proposal document will be available electronically on or about December 21, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps <http://www.fedbizopps.gov/>.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or e-mail transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain results from ASE's "Power is in Your Hands" campaign and interactive website at www.6degreechallenge.com  to promote energy efficiency, a critical part of CPPD's  mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  ASE has developed all of the copy for the "6 Degrees of Energy Efficiency Challenge" website and will be responsible  for hosting the website during the five-month campaign.  The website will include information about EPA ENERGY STAR; encourage consumers  to test their knowledge about energy and energy efficiency by taking a six question quiz; encourage consumers to then pledge to undertake at least one energy-efficient action (e.g., purchase and install compact flourescent light bulbs); encourage this same individual to inform six friends about the  website; and allow website users to avail themselves of discount coupons on energy-efficient products (e.g., 3M Window Insulator Kits).   The website also will include energy-efficiency messages backed up by research;  information for the media (statistics on energy use, news releases, etc); and  links to each partner's website and a variety of valuable resources developed for the "Power is in Your Hands" website at www.powerisinyourhands.org (e.g., home energy, transportation, and commercial business tips; information on federal energy-efficiency tax credits;  ways to conduct home energy  audits, and other state, local and utility incentive programs.)  The "Power is in Your Hands" campaign is a winter campaign to encourage consumers to take control of their energy bills by implementing energy efficiency into their everyday lives.  "Six Degrees" messaging will be used throughout the  "Power is in Your Hands" campaign. ASE will also conduct extensive proactive media outreach throughout the campaign.  The "Power is in Your Hands" campaign will include makeovers of low-income family homes.  These events will include upgrading of homes with energy-efficient products, such as  insulation, tankless hot water heaters, compact fluorescent light bulbs, sealant, programmable thermostats, etc.  The home makeovers will be accompanied by a press event whereby key spokespersons for the campaign at the national, state and local levels will be invited to discuss the benefits of  energy efficiency.  Newsletters will be developed on each of the home makeovers for distribution to the Agency, and for uploading on the 6 Degrees of Energy Efficiency Challenge website in order to increase the visibility of this important outreach effort. Under this order, the website results will  be tracked as a means of measuring the success of the campaign and will report findings to EPA with regular email updates and a final report.  Information will include: (1) The number and value of media impressions based on satellite media tours, radio media tours, energy-efficiency home makeovers,  press events, print and web coverage, and a detailed report on when and where the various communication outlets aired and the readership of the associated publications; and (2) A report of website traffic to include  the number of people going to the 6 Degrees of Energy Efficiency Challenge website  as well as those who answer the six questions and accept the challenge. Also included will be the number of visitors going to www.6degreechallenge.com and their use patterns on the site to determine the most popular pages, etc. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 611710. ASE is uniquely  qualified to satisfy this requirement because it has already created the necessary copy and website infrastructure to collect the required data.  In addition, ASE  has unique expertise in the energy-efficiency sector, significant third-party credibility, and a stellar track record of media outreach  and the production of award-winning PSA campaigns.  Long sought out by consumer groups, the media and the environmental and business communities as a crucial source of information on energy efficiency, ASE has undertaken several nationwide campaigns to elevate the public's understanding of the role  of energy efficiency. As such, NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be  considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. The estimated value of this procurement is below the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion  of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a modified synopsis.  The original synopsis stated that the proposed contract is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns. Offers from concerns other than SBs will not be considered. All responsible SBs submitting a proposal will be considered by NSWCCD. Due to a lack of proposals from small business concerns on the previous two contracts (N65540-05-M-0312 and N65540-06-M5202) the proposed contract is now unrestricted and open to full and open competition.  This change has been made because there is no reasonable expectation that two or more small businesses will submit proposals for this proposed contract.   The rest of the details remain the same as stated on the original synopsis.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of identifying and determining the availability of sources capable of performing design/build (DB) construction services. These services are required for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pascagoula Laboratory Project in Pascagoula, MS.  

Project Scope: The proposed project is new construction of approximately 51,000 gross square feet to house laboratory, support services, and administrative functions of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Mississippi Laboratories and National Seafood Inspection Laboratory (NSIL). The building footprint limitation will probably require a two-story structure plus an equipment penthouse to provide the necessary space. This structure will be used for cutting edge marine science and technology research and should be designed to facilitate and reflect those activities. Proactive and preventive hurricane survivability measures are mandatory for this structure. Additionally, it must meet a minimum sustainability requirement of Silver on the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification scale of the U.S. Green Building Council. The work will consist of design and construction of the new facility and associated parking on the proposed construction site based on a schematic level description of requirements. The maximum available funding for all design and construction effort is $22.0 million. Occupancy is planned for mid-2009.

Basis for Evaluation: Responses to this announcement will be used to determine whether there are enough qualified DB small business sources to permit a small business set-aside (SBSA) acquisition or whether a full and open competition will need to be conducted for this action. Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria presented in descending order of importance:

1. Documented recent experience in DB construction of laboratories, full-service hospitals, or similar facilities to include associated complex heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
2. Documented experience in performing and successfully completing comparable projects in the post-Hurricane Katrina/Hurricane Rita stricken areas of the Gulf Coast states.
3. Proven established subcontracting relationships in the Gulf Coast states region on comparable recent projects.
4. Proven ability to successfully complete comparable recent projects at the required quality level, on schedule, and within budget.
5. Documented LEED experience on comparable projects.

Submission of Responses: Sources can be a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity having full contractual responsibility for the project. To be responsive to this sources sought notice, interested parties must submit the following documentation:

1. Evidence of successful experience on DB projects of similar type and scope during the past ten years. Evidence must include contract numbers, project titles, total project dollar values, and points of contact with current contact information to include telephone and facsimile numbers and e-mail addresses. More importance will be assigned to more recent experience. 
2. Evidence of experience in performing and successfully completing comparable projects in the post-Hurricane Katrina/Hurricane Rita stricken areas of the Gulf Coast states.
3. Evidence of established subcontracting relationships in the Gulf Coast states region on comparable recent projects.
4. Evidence of ability to successfully complete comparable recent projects at the required quality level, on schedule, and within budget.
5. Documented LEED experience on comparable projects.
6. Evidence of current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) documenting size status and other socioeconomic qualifications.
7. A positive statement of intention to submit an offer as a prime contractor under any resulting solicitation.
8. Evidence of bonding capacity at the maximum anticipated value of this project.

Submissions shall be no more than 25 pages in length, in 8 1/2-by-11-inch format, single-spaced, and in no less than a 12-point font. If submissions are two-sided, each side of a sheet of paper will be counted as one page. Submissions may be sent as e-mail attachments of no more than 5 mb in portable document format (.pdf). Submissions provided in response to this notice will not be returned. All submissions received will be evaluated by qualified NOAA professionals. A determination by the Government to restrict competition for this project based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This is not a request for proposals. Nor is it an offer to contract or a Phase One solicitation for qualification statements. This announcement does not create any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this notice nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this notice. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government?s evaluation of the information received. It is anticipated that a single best value negotiated solicitation for the entire DB process will be issued for this project. It is expected that it will result in a firm fixed-price contract award.

Submissions in response to this notice must be received not later than Monday, January 8, 2007, at 3:00 p.m. CST.

<SUBJECT>D -- Implementation & Deployment Specialist
<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB CA intends to award a contract for the purchase of an Implementation and Deployment Specialist(s) for the implementation and deployment of the Comprehensive Cost and Requirement System (CCaRS) Software.  The award will result in a sole-source, one-year firm fixed-priced contract with a one-year option to Integrated Data Services Inc, 2141 Rosecrans Ave, El Segundo, CA 90245-5045.

This action will be awarded as a new contract for a basic period of performance of 1 Jan 07 through 30 Sep 08.  The purpose of the acquisition is to obtain installation and on-site administration, sustainment, and enhancement of the Comprehensive Cost and Requirement System (CCaRS), the implementation efforts, functional CCAR support, program management and technical support will be acquired under a Firm Fixed-Priced contract.
 
CCaRS is a computer application which is used by Air Force (AF) Acquisition and Sustainment organizations to manage their weapon system requirements, associated funding and reporting, and analysis of these elements.  CCaRS is primarily targeted to the specific needs of the Acquisition and Sustainment organizations in the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).  The purpose of this contract is to acquire sustainment and maintenance of the CCaRS software, provide functional/technical on-site support services (including both interface between Integrated Data Service (IDS, the CCaRS developer) and the local customer and daily maintenance of the CCaRS application and its Oracle databases). 

Any new deployment and implementation of the Comprehensive Cost and Requirements (CCaR) System (of which Integrated Data Services (IDS) is the owner and sole developer) requires the parallel support of the CCaR Implementation and Deployment Specialist(s).  During the pre-deployment phase, the Implementation and Deployment Specialist will work with the government POC to help identify legacy systems/spreadsheet data that could be migrated into the CCaR tool.  Additionally, the Implementation and Deployment Specialist will participate in discussions with the appropriate government personnel on how to configure CCaR features for the best support of Center/Wing/Group business goals and will provide guidance on insertion of business process approval flows, budget definitions, business rules, user privileges, custom fields, and definable general data fields. In order to accomplish these tasks and provide high level recommendations for system use, the Implementation and Deployment Specialist must not only be well versed in the areas of government acquisition and financial management, but must also be an expert in the functionality and operation of the CCaR tool.  All CCaR Implementation and Deployment Specialists must be formally trainined in CCaR and have received their certification in CCaR Implementation and Deployment from IDS. During actual deployment, the CCaR Implementation and Deployment Specialist must work in conjunction with IDS Subject Matter Expert(s), Database Administrator(s), and Project Lead(s) in order to assist with the customization of the CCaR instance in support of the unique Center/Wing/Group requirements at the deployment site.  Upon completion of CCaR database customization, the CCaR Implementation and Deployment Specialist will focus on providing the initial population of CCaR user accounts, budget structures, custom field reporting, coordination workflows, system settings, etc.  Additionally, the CCaR Implementation and Deployment Specialist must have a sufficient background in, and experience with database applications, in order to monitor the accuracy of data received from the other systems that interface with CCaR (ABSS, ConWrite, GAFS, MOCAS, etc.). Furthermore, the CCaR Implementation and Deployment Specialist will be responsible for conducting all initial user training on CCaR functionality. All CCaR Implementation and Deployment Specialists must be "CCaR Certified" prior to engaging in training. 

The NAICS code is 541519 with an SBA size standard of $23 Million.  Qualified contractors must submit clear and convincing documentation that fully defines their capability to meet the requirement.  Documentation that fails to provide the required capability documentation will not be acknowledged.  Telephone requests to be placed on the mailing list will not be honored.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  The government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  

Note 22.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-09 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Next Generation Wireless Networking
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Next Generation Wireless Networking

DESCRIPTION

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) have been the focus of much attention and investment by the DoD over recent years because of their potential cost and performance advantages for tactical edge communications. MANET concepts have shown promise by replacing the expensive infrastructure laden "hub-and-spoke" architectures configured around centralized base stations with an open peer-to-peer architecture that supports dynamic network topologies that both self-organize and self-heal.  Implementing the MANET concept for efficient use in tactical operations has, however, proved challenging. Current network implementations have been plagued with insufficient performance and network lifetime, limited scalability, excessive network overhead, and significant security vulnerabilities. The practical limitations of MANETs suggest that the DoD should also investigate new alternative approaches. 

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Strategic Technology Office (DARPA STO) requests information on revolutionary, paradigm-shifting wireless communication and networking concepts that enable scalable, high-performance, robust communications under high tempo mobility and stringent size, weight, and power constraints, while providing reliable end-to-end security. Desirable approaches should include, but are not limited to, the following characteristics:
--	Limited or no reliance on the use of overhead assets, air platforms, and/or centralized control/infrastructure. 
--	Node-to-node communication ranges exceeding 1 km with line-of-sight (LOS) obstructions between nodes.  
--	Low probability of detection and exploitation communications. 
--	Greater than 300 Kbps end-to-end network data throughput to support compressed video transmission for networks with up to 200 nodes.
--	Greater than 90% sustained packet delivery ratio for tactical communications between nodes moving at speeds up to 60 mph.

Target environments include, but are not limited to, urban canyons or mountainous terrain where obstructions may preclude direct LOS communications. Multi-hop communication approaches that use short range LOS communications between nodes to communicate over long distances are not desired. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS
This announcement is a request for white papers in support of developing innovative and creative alternative approaches to MANETs that have potential for revolutionary improvements in communication capability at the tactical edge.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of Nucleic Binding Detectors Using Carbon Nanotube Transistors
<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. plans to enter into a sole source subcontract for Development of Nucleic Binding Detectors using Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Transistors with the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.  

To facilitate the development of the nanoplatforms, SAIC-Frederick will acquire the services and research collaborations from a highly experienced laboratory with advanced fabrication facilities (level 100 clean room capabilities, for example), and extensive quality control/quality assurance capabilities for producing carbon nanotubes and silicon nanowires.  Further, the resulting contractual agreement will require the nanoscale platforms to be delivered in an array format (2cm x 2cm) to conform with the similar DNA detection platforms that are commercially available.

The effort will be a comprehensive and multifaceted approach led by two research scientists at two institutions and involves three co-principal investigators from the University of Maryland (UMD), NIH and NASA.  It is aimed at optimizing the characteristics of the CNT and sINW transistors and the development of the methodologies for system integration and large scale fabrication.  As such, there is a need for the close interrelationships of tasks to be performed at CCR, NCI and UMD.  It is this collaboration that represents the key strength of this project.  The devices will be initially optimized specifically for genomic profiles that play a significant role in childhood cancer.  All protocols that would be developed will be consistent with those that re currently used, and the results of our measurements will be calibrated against known microarray schemes.  As a consequence, the devices will have a considerably simplified route towards acceptance and analysis by biologists and clinicians.

The collaborative group, comprised of about 19 researchers, will be divided into teams with specific foci:

	Team 1:	UMD:  CNT fabrication and development, oversight
	Team 1b:	NASA:  SiNW transistor fabrication
	Team 2:	UMD: Circuits implementation
Team 3:	Probe design, chemistry, probe attachment, hybridization, 					molecular biology, biological experiments, field testing, and 					oversight
Much of the equipment and infrastructure to carry out the projects are already in place and the existing expertise and capabilities of each of the teams are leveraged for this project.

Team 1 will be based at UMD whose main focus will be to understand the characteristics of the CNT filed effect transistors and to fabricate them with optimal characteristics.  CNTs will be grown using high temperature reduction of methane and ethane in the presence of nanometer particle catalysis?s on the surface.  The electrical characteristics will be measured and compared with atomic and micron scale morphology.  A key requirement for the robust devices is the uniformity of t growth, the alignment and distribution of the sizes and the chirality of the grown CNT.

The aim of this collaboration is to identify the optimal method for detecting the presence of hybridization of nucleic acids using oligo nucleotide probes using CNT and development of SiNW transistors; test the optimal probe between short oligonucuclotide DNA fragments, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and locked nucleic acids (LNA) probes on the nano devices;  apply methodology for the detection of mRNA, DNA and miRNA; apply methodology for the detection of single base pair changes in DNA and hence for sequencing purposes; develop multiplex detection system for multiple probe sets; apply methodology for the detection of single base pair changes in DNA and hence for sequencing purposes; develop multiplex detection system for multiple probe sets; integrate pattern recognition software with the apparatus for a compressive device whose output is the predicted diagnosis.
  
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Because of the importance of the transferring technical knowledge and skills to and from the NCI and the need for a high degree of interactivity among investigators for intense periods of time, it is essential that subcontractors? facilities be located within a 30 mile radius of the NCI-Rockville Advanced Technology Center and NASA Goddard Space Center in Greenbelt, MD.

The University of Maryland is uniquely qualified for this program due to its extended nanotechnology facilities, its relationship and proximity to NASA and its close proximity to the NIH/NCI Bethesda campus (within the requisite 30 mile radius). Moreover, the technique proposed by the University of Maryland is expected to surpass existing technology in sensitivity, ease of use; the capability toward miniaturization; and does not require chemical or enzymatic manipulation of the nucleic acid being detected.  

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.501.  

This notice is being posted for the benefit of other subcontractors that may be within the 30 mile radius range requirement and have the unique capabilities to accomplish the work as described. Should you feel your organization meets the criterion, please submit a capabilities statement by noon (EST) December 22, 2006 to Ms. Jeanne Lewis at jlewis@mail.ncifcrf.gov.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 21 July 2006, 10:00 A.M.

Factor 4:  Construction Safety -Phase I

The Government desires to do business with only those firms that excel in safety performance.  This factor exists to emphasize the importance of safety in and around all construction sites and at the base where construction work is being performed.   This factor consists of two subfactors that (1) will evaluate specific aspects of the offerors construction safety program and (2) will evaluate the offeror?s safety performance history by contacting references, including but not limited to clients, insurance agencies and subcontractors.  For purposes of this evaluation, Subfactor A is less important than Subfactor B.    

Subfactor A:  Safety Program.  The offeror shall provide information that demonstrates a corporate commitment to construction safety by addressing the following:

Processes/Standard Operating Procedures
Management Involvement/Commitment
Employee participation and training
Incentive/Awards program
Other safety program innovations

Offerors shall not submit their Corporate Safety Plan to satisfy the response to this subfactor.  

Subfactor B:  Safety Performance History.  Provide the number of mishap/accidents for the most recent 100,000-man hours of construction.  This information is required for the prime contractor and all subcontractors that worked on the past contracts. Your response shall address each of the following:

		Description of Accident/Mishap and whether prime or subcontractor event 
Date/location of occurrence and contract title
Actions taken following accident/mishap
		Agency/client POC and phone number
		Employer (of employee affected by event) POC and phone number

The Government will contact references for the purpose of validating the information provided in response to this factor as well as obtaining further insight into each offeror?s corporate safety philosophy.   The frequency and severity of events may have significant impact in the rating assigned to this factor.  The Government reserves the right to call any or all previous clients for the purpose of obtaining additional information regarding your record of accidents and mishaps.  
 
Factor 5a:  Subcontracting History ? Phase I

Factor 5a is included to obtain the Offerors commitment to utilize Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone Small Business (HUBZONE SB), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Historically Black college and University/Minority Institutes (HBCU/MI). 

Factor 5a in Phase I and 5b in Phase II are subfactors equal in importance to each other.  Factor 5b will be evaluated under Phase II and an overall rating for this factor will be assigned.
 
Offerors must address the following in sufficient detail to allow proper evaluation and rating: 

PAST PERFORMANCE IN UTILIZING SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone SB, SDVOSB and HBCU/MI concerns in previous contracts

Provide information on any awards you?ve received within the past three (3) years for outstanding support to the small business community. 

Large Business Firms:  

1.	Provide SF-294 forms, "Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts?, for projects identified under technical factor 1, Relevant Past Performance.   If the reference projects were not DOD procurements and an SF-294 was not required, provide any other documentation showing compliance with the utilization of Small Business firms in each noted category. (e.g., Small, Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone Small, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small and Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions, if applicable).  Include the dollar value and percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to these entities.  If goals were not met on the reference contracts, provide an explanation as to why.
2.	Provide performance evaluation ratings obtained on implementation of subcontracting plans, if available on the DOD contracts submitted under (a) above.

3.	Provide information on existing or pending mentor-prot?g? agreements.

4.	Provide information, if available on use of Community Rehabilitation Programs organizations certified under the Javits-Wagner O?Day Program (JWOD) by NISH or NIB.

Small Business Firms:  

1.	Provide information on any awards you?ve received within the past three (3) years for outstanding support to the small business community. 

2.	For projects identified under technical factor 1, Relevant Experience, provide information that includes the dollar value and percentage of work (of the total contract value) subcontracted to Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged, Women Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions, if applicable.

4.	Provide information, if available on the use of Community Rehabilitation Programs organizations certified under the Javits-Wagner O?Day Program (JWOD) by NISH or NIB.
 
 

 
Past Performance ? Phase I

Past Performance information is one indicator of an Offeror?s ability to successfully perform this contract.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The assessment of the Offeror?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and establish a level of risk (high, moderate, or low) for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the standing of the Offeror.  Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria.  Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance.

Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction, timely delivery of services, adherence to contract schedules, subcontractor management, safety management, quality control programs, good workmanship, conformance to specifications, and fair and reasonable prices. 
 
Offerors are responsible for ensuring the completed questionnaires are submitted, by their references, via electronic submission to Robert Rounay at robert.rounay@navy.mil and Kathleen McCourt at kathleen.mccourt@navy.mil.  The questionnaires shall be returned at least one (1) week prior to the bid due date, but absolutely no later than the bid due date and time.

Since the Government will contact the individuals identified in Factor 1 and Factor 2, it is critical that these individuals be familiar with the project to answer specific questions regarding your performance.  The Government may choose to contact additional customer(s) not provided by an offeror and may obtain additional information through other sources, such as the Past Performance Retrieval System (PPIRS), and phone interviews.   In addition to references provided under Factor 1 and Factor 2, you may include additional references that are knowledgeable of your firm?s performance.  In evaluating past performance, the Government will focus on information derived from the projects that are most relevant to this project.
