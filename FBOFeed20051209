<DESC>This Broad Area Announcement (BAA), in combination with its supplemental attachments and web site, constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this notice be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Quantum Information Science (QIS) Program is open to all research and development organizations whether located in the U.S. or not, including large and small businesses; academic and eligible non-profit and not-for-profit institutions; collaborative ventures from mixed sources; and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).  In the future, the National Director of Intelligence's Disruptive Technology Office (DTO) intends to release other BAAs through the Department of Interior, National Business Center located at Fort Huachuca, and possibly other agencies (e.g., the Army Research Office), addressing related topics.  DTO reserves the right to unilaterally redirect white papers and proposals to such other BAAs as it deems appropriate.  Please refer to http://nbc.gov/qis.cfm and http://www.aro.army.mil for more information on related BAAs. INTRODUCTION.  The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition and Property Management Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, acting as the contracting agent for the National Director of Intelligence's Disruptive Technology Office (DTO) (formerly the Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA)), is issuing this BAA to solicit research and research support proposals addressing innovative research in the field of quantum information science.  Quantum mechanics promises physically secure transmittal of information, as well as tremendous speed-up of computation through non-classical operations and the algorithms they enable.  This work package seeks to elucidate, control, and exploit quantum phenomena for revolutionary advancement of computation and secure communication.  In addition, it seeks to accelerate development of ancillary technology critical to common areas of research.   Multiple awards are possible with typical periods of performance of 12 to 24 months with the possibility of option years including final reports and/or demonstrations.  The program will have the ability to handle rapidly changing constraints and anticipates multiple awards up to a total value of approximately $8 million over 2 years.  All awards will be subject to critical milestone reviews on an annual basis, at which time option and continuation decisions will be made. A Proposer's Information Pamphlet (PIP) supplements the information in this BAA announcement.   You must follow the direction of this PIP which provides further information on the eligibility, research areas, multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals, and selection criteria.  The PIP will be updated to the FY06 BAA on or about December 13, 2005 on the Department of Interior NBC Website at http://www.nbc.gov/solicit.html.   Do not use the FY04 BAA which is currently posted.  The FY04  BAA is now closed.   The PIP may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or ground mail by sending a request to the Department of the Interior, Fort Huachuca by electronic mail to Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov or by calling 520.533.1213.   PROGRAM BACKGROUND.  DTO seeks innovative research to support and advance its quantum information science objectives.  The Quantum Information Science Roadmaps are published at http://qist.lanl.gov/.  This includes the Quantum Communication Roadmap and the Quantum Computation Roadmap (version 2 now posted) providing background technical information and summarizing the main technology areas comprising the current programs.  The Roadmaps also discuss the overall status of each major technology area and some of their strengths and weaknesses.  In general, proposals must explicitly identify which of the milestone(s) of the Roadmap(s) are being addressed or have a compelling explanation for why they are not consistent with those milestones.    PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.  There are four (4) major areas of interest within the program: 1.  Quantum Computation.  The long-term objective of quantum computing is to provide new and radically different computational capabilities that go beyond classical computers.  While quantum computing may ultimately entail the assembly and manipulation of large numbers of quantum bits (qubits), experimental demonstrations of quantum logic performed on several quantum bits operating simultaneously would currently represent a significant advance.  Demonstrations of quantum feedback or error correction for multiple quantum bit systems are also of interest.  In addition to physical implementations of quantum computing, there is strong interest in developing new quantum algorithms providing new methods for solving classically intractable problems or that greatly improve on existing classical algorithms (e.g. in speed or memory requirements).   2.  Quantum Communication.  The ability to transmit information through quantum channels, and especially to exploit entanglement between spatially separated quantum entities, has opened the possibility for a means of communication with security based on physical principles and laws, rather than mathematical algorithms.  The objective here is two-fold; advanced quantum cryptography systems, and communication of quantum information based on distributed entanglement such as in quantum teleportation.  Experimental demonstration of innovative entanglement-based quantum cryptography systems is of particular interest.  Of further interest is the demonstration of long-range quantum entanglement, entanglement transfer among different quantum systems and long-term quantum memory.   	3.  Supporting Fundamental Studies.  One objective is to ascertain the limits of the ability to create, control, and utilize quantum information in multiple quantum entities in the presence of noise.  Experimental investigations of coherence properties, decoherence mechanisms, decoherence mitigation, entanglement, nondestructive measurement, complex quantum state manipulation, and quantum feedback are of interest.  Of particular interest is demonstration of high-fidelity coherent quantum state manipulation on time scales much faster than decoherence times.  Physical systems that promise scalability to many quantum bits and quantum operations will receive the greatest attention.  Theoretical analyses of non-classical phenomena may also be of interest if the work is strongly coupled to a specific experimental investigation, as may proof-of-concept demonstrations in atomic, molecular, and optical systems or in solid-sate systems.  Only fundamental studies advancing the goals of objectives 1 and 2, above, will be considered for funding under this BAA. 4.  Supporting Enabling Technology.  The experimental investigations discussed in the objectives above may require special technologies or devices difficult to procure, or commercially unavailable.  Directed efforts may be needed to develop and fabricate technology critical to any of DTO's quantum information science programs.  DTO's Quantum Communications programs have particular interest in robust, high-speed single photon and entangled photon-pair sources; operating at visible to telecommunications wavelengths.  Single photon sources may include cavity-based, atomic, and quantum dot constructions. Indistinguishability is critical for certain applications. Sources may also include waveguide constructions for fiber applications.  Similarly, robust, high-speed and high-quantum-efficiency single photon and number-resolving photon detectors having relatively low dark count rates and low jitter are of interest.  Temperature of operation is a concern for field-ready robust devices. For entangled sources, end-to-end components are of interest; including pump-laser technology for parametric down-conversion in bulk, fiber and waveguide photonic constructions.  This may include diode, fiber and other pump-laser technologies that are amenable to development of pulsed, bright, robust, compact, high fidelity entangled source systems.  Advances in nonlinear materials, processing and constructions for entanglement generation are of interest. Constructions and systems for pulsed, bright, robust, compact, high fidelity entangled photon sources are of interest.  Additional areas of interest include low loss (<0.1%) optical components and fibers, e.g., low loss blue and 1.5 micron-friendly optics and fibers, optical UV switches (>40dB isolation), stable high speed lasers, solid state 200-400nm sources, and photon/quantum storage constructions. For example, interconversion is of interest.  DTO's Quantum Computing program requires development of advanced laser technologies for qubit manipulation, measurement and control at the device level. This is required in part to achieve extraordinary gate fidelity. Such technologies include, but are not limited to; techniques and concepts to greatly increase laser intensity and phase stability (visible, near IR and UV stable lasers), innovative integrated optics (rapidly steering 100s and 1000s beams on a chip a few cm or mm square), high reflectivity micro cavities (current mirrors are ~100X lower than Rayleigh scattering limit), novel emerging cavity technologies and micro-photonic band gap cavities, ultra fast electro-optical feed-forward control of optical switches and sub-nanosecond speed,  low-loss (<0.1%) optical switches.  Examples provided above are not meant to exclude additional diverse components important to quantum applications. Two Step Submission Process Step 1 - White Paper:  A white paper is the only way to start the application process.

<DESC>Request for Information BLS06-03

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is seeking information from industry relating to its need for virtual machine software. This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested vendors who are able to satisfy the requirements detailed in the description below.  BLS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this request.  This RFI is being issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  The information contained in this RFI is based on the best and most current information available to date, is subject to change, and is not binding on the Government.  Below is background information and description of the requirements for virtual machine software.

Technology
Virtual Machine technology allows a more efficient usage of computing hardware by allowing more than one operating system to run concurrently on an individual hardware platform.  Traditional configurations allow one operating system per hardware platform which often results in substantial underutilization of computing capacity.  The ability to virtually host multiple operating systems on an individual hardware platform will allow the consolidation and more efficient use of this computing capacity.  

Security and Support Requirements 
As with any IT product being used in the Bureau, security related support is of primary importance.  The supplier of the virtual machine technology chosen must have a stated policy regarding how they will address any vulnerabilities and security issues that arise in the software.  

This policy should consist of:
•	Monitoring Public Security Tracking Resources
•	Quickly Acknowledging Security Issues and Notifying Customers
•	Issuance of Mitigation Strategies and Workarounds for Discovered Security Threats on a Published Time Schedule
•	Timely Issuance of Security Patches
•	Independently Audited Source Code with Recommendations Implemented Into Future Releases.

Hardware Platform Requirements
This research will be conducted using the current BLS approved hardware platform for Intel based servers.  There is no intention to revisit the current BLS hardware specifications to accommodate the VM technology that is selected unless there is an overwhelming need to do so as determined by BLS technical management.  (e.g. no candidates exist that will fulfill the requirements on the BLS approved hardware platform).  The current BLS approved server hardware applicable to this request is:
•	HP Proliant DL380G4 3.4Ghz
Standard Features : 
1 Intel Xeon 3.4 GHz processor (dual capability)
1 MB level 2 ECC cache
Supports for up to six 1" Wide Ultra3/Ultra320 SCSI hot plug hard drives or five hot plug hard drives and one AIT hot plug tape drive
1 GB (expandable to 12GB) of 2-way interleaved capable PC3200 DDR2 SDRAM running at 400MHz, with advanced ECC capabilities and Online spare capabilities
800-MHz Front Side Bus
24x IDE CD-ROM
Embedded NC7782 10/100/1000 PCI-X Gigabit Network Interface Cards
Integrated ATI Rage XL Video Controller with 8MB SDRAM Video Memory
2U Rack form factor chassis, 3.5 inches in height and fits 19" wide racks
3 64-bit PCI-X slots - (2 non-hot plug 64-bit/100MHz, 1 64-bit/133MHz), 3.3 volts or universal card compatible
3.5" floppy drive
2 575-Watt Hot plug power supplies
Hot plug fans
Sliding rails for in-rack mounting

•	HP Proliant DL360G4p 3.4Ghz
Standard Features : 
1 Intel Xeon 3.4 GHz processor (dual capability)
 2 MB level 2 ECC cache
 Supports for up to two 1” Wide Ultra3/Ultra320 SCSI hot plug hard drives
 Internal hot plug capacity 600GB standard (2 x 300GB 1 inch HD)
 2 GB (expandable to 12GB) of 2-way interleaved capable PC2-3200 DDR SDRAM running at 400MHz, with advanced ECC capabilities and Online spare capabilities
 Five Peer PCI Architecture with 400-MHz Front Side Bus
24x IDE CD-ROM
 Embedded NC7782 10/100/1000 PCI-X Gigabit Network Interface Cards
Integrated ATI Rage XL Video Controller with 8MB SDRAM Video Memory
1U Rack form factor chassis, 1.7 inches in height and fits 19 inch wide racks
1 full length and 1 half length 64-bit PCI-X slots
3.5" floppy drive
2 460-Watt Hot plug power supplies
Hot plug fans (with optional redundancy)
Sliding rails for in-rack mounting

Software  should conform to the following hardware related requirements:
•	Must run on Intel Based Hardware Platform (BLS Approved Platform)
•	Must run Directly on Hardware (not as an application running on an existing operating system such as Linux or Windows 2000)
o	This is critical requirement due to the potential exposure of multiple virtualized operating systems and related data if a security vulnerability were to be exploited by unauthorized persons in the VM host.  Having a VM host solution that runs directly on the hardware, as opposed to running over an existing operating system (such as Windows 2000 Server),  minimizes the interfaces that must be secured and results in a purpose built  host component that is striped down of unnecessary functionality and complexity.  
•	Must Offer Support for Multiple Processors

Operating System and Application Support
The VM system will be used to support the BLS approved server operating system, which is currently Microsoft 2000 Server.  It must also support Windows 2003 server, which is almost assuredly going to be the next approved operating system in the very near future.  The VM candidate must also support a specified minimum number of operating systems per hardware platform as specified below:.
•	Must Support, at Minimum, a Total of 8 Windows Server Operating Systems on Each Piece of Hardware.  This may be a combination of Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 Server Operating Systems.
•	Must support Citrix MetaFrame XP Application Server Hosted on a Windows 2000 or 2003 Operating System.
•	Must Support Microsoft Exchange 2003 on a Windows 2000 or 2003 Operating System.

Other Requirements
The vendors must provide a statement of how the applicable Federal 508 requirements are addressed.

Respondents are requested to offer comments regarding the requirements as stated above, level of detail, completeness, consistency with industry best practices, suitability for achieving stated objectives, any areas that have been left out and should be considered, potential cost of the system and whether or not the items are available for purchase off the GSA schedule.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  BLS reserves the right to conduct oral capabilities demonstrations/discussions that may be scheduled at a later date. 
All information should be submitted to:

The estimated cost range for this project is between $100,000 and $250,000. The solicitation will be available on or about December 28, 2005. The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled “Register with FedTeDS” and then choosing the “Vendor Registration Form” hyperlink.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  (Your Company’s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company’s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company’s DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation. .  Mail, facsimile, telephonic or electronic mail requests will not be honored.

DFARS Section 208.74 directs DoD software buyers to check the DoD Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) website for existing Enterprise Software Agreements (ESAs) that satisfy requirements before using any other method of acquisition.  A review of the ESAs found that the AVMS-R BPA was the only ESA available to meet the requirements.  Additionally, a review of Federal Supply Schedules found a number of resellers, however, the prices offered were higher than those on the AVMS-R BPA ESA and the ESA is supposed to be used before any other method of acquisition.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NAVFAC MARIANAS, Guam plans to solicit and negotiate a procurement on a sole source basis with Black Construction Corporation (BCC), P.O. Box, 24667, GMF, Guam, 96921 to install two (2) each 120V shunt trips for the boiler circuit breakers and to provide a hydrostatic test of the steamlines in accordance with ASME.B31.1.  

BCC possesses the unique capabilities and expertise to install the emergency disconnect switches as they were the incumbent on the P-250 Waterfront Utilities Upgrade Installation, N2742-01-C-1334.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB), plans to procure on a sole-source basis an FEI Vitrobot III (Vitrification Robot) a PC-controlled devise for vitrification (rapid cooling) with FEI Company 5350 NE Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, Oregon 97124. 

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The National Cancer Institute has a need to upgrade the current FEI Vitrobot machine to the newer Mark III version.  This instrument is used to reproducibly produce frozen hydrated specimens for electron microscopy and in particular Electron Tomography.  The Vitrobot (Vitrification Robot) is a fully PC-controlled device for vitrification (rapid cooling) of aqueous samples.   The process of plunging, blotting and vitrification is fully automated upon placing a vial in the chamber and setting up the liquid coolant container. Operational parameters are reproducible and the result is strictly PC controlled, enabling a high throughput of vitrified samples, with an easy and straightforward control of the vitrification process.   The instrument will consistently produce excellent specimens for cryo-electron microscopy. Researchers can now rely on specimen preparation allowing the investigator to concentrate on structural studies of the specimen.
  
FEI Company is the only known manufacturer to the NCI researcher of such an instrument which allows accurate computer control over the temperature and humidity of the specimen and provides a unique blotting mechanism resulting in films of reproducible ice thickness. Ice thickness is the single most important parameter in obtaining high quality digital images of the samples being studied

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on December 19, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Please reference NCI-60018-NG on all correspondence.  Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.

The services requested are: 1) Perform at least 50 tests on a scale model of at least 6" in diameter in a high enthalpy (between 10 and 20 MJ/kg) flow field with a range of reservoir pressures between 20 and 70 MPa. Vendor is required to build a model. The model will be of blunt-body geometry similar to the Apollo capsule. The model must be a minimum 6 inches in diameter. The exact geometry for the model will be provided to the vendor by the Government after award is made; 2) Provide heat transfer data with uncertainty estimates for the range of enthalpies and Reynolds numbers above at a minimum of 50 locations on the model; 3) Provide aerodynamic force and moment measurements for the range of enthalpies and Reynolds numbers above; 4) Provide expert analysis assessing turbulent transition; 5) Include error bars and uncertainty estimates in the reports; and 6) Provide access to the facility, and insight into data collection procedures and data reduction processes during testing, including access to all raw data traces.  Delivery to NASA ARC is required as follows:  1) A preliminary data report no later than February 15, 2006 that includes heat transfer and aerodynamic force data with error bars and facility operating conditions for all shots completed to that date.  2) A draft of the final test report no later than July 15, 2006 that includes the results and analysis as completed of the heat transfer and aerodynamic force data with error bars, flow field images, assessment of turbulent transition, and facility operating conditions. 3) A final test report no later than December 15, 2006 that includes the complete set heat transfer and aerodynamic force data with error bars, flow field images, assessment of turbulent transition, and facility operating conditions. Additionally, close coordination with ARC is necessary as the data provided by the vendor must be analyzed and integrated into the CEV flight aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic databases.  The vendor must be able to accomodate ARC's requirement to allow the Government to witness the testing, as needed.	 NASA/ARC intends to purchase the testing and analysis services from the California Institute of Technology.  Caltech’s T5 shock tunnel facility and testing and analysis team has the capability to meet all of the test requirements.  The research team, under Professor Hans Hornung, has a great deal of experience in the field of hypersonics and high enthalpy test facilities. Caltech's T5 shock tunnel has produced high quality heat transfer data for a range of DoD, NASA, and industrial customers for over 15 years.   The authority for other than full and open competion is 10 U.S.C. 2304(a)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  Based on NASA's market survey, Caltech is the only source capable of fufilling the requirements, given the schedule constraints and the need for close coordination with ARC.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 noon PST on or before December 23, 2005. Such capabilities and/or qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)1 as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences anticipates negotiations with the University of Utah on a non-competitive basis to extend the current contract for an additional twelve (12), and up to twenty-four (24), months. During the extension period, the contractor will continue to provide support to accomplish the following objectives: 1)  import SNP-discovery data for newly re-sequenced genes from the University of Washington effort (contract N01-ES-15478); 2) import high quality, well validated SNP data relevant to NIEHS-listed ERGs from other publicly available web resources; 3)  convert the data imported from the University of Washington and other publicly available databases to the graphical display developed by the University of Utah; 4)  make newly imported, converted data available to the public through the web-accessible GeneSNPs database; 5) maintain the database to minimize downtime; and 6)  continue with the process already in progress of updating and transferring the database to NIEHS, and ensuring that the database is fully functional once established at NIEHS.  Inherent duplication of costs to the Government, unacceptable delays impacting upon the stated objectives and the necessity to maintain continuity, compatibility, and consistency in the data make competition unfeasible.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>031506
<ARCHDATE>05142006
<CONTACT>Melissa  Witt, 309-782-3743
<DESC>This is a sole source five-year requirements solicitation for a maximum of 378,000 M40A1/M42A2 Chemical Biological Mask and Facepiece Assemblies (S)/(M)/(L), NSNs: 4240-01-370-3821/3822/3823, Part Numbers: 5-1-2740-10/20/30; and the mask Facepiece As sembly (S)/(M)/(L), NSNs: 4240-01-415-4517/4518/-416-0430, Part Numbers: 5-1-1001-10/20/30.  The M40A1/M42A2 CB Masks protect face, eyes, and lungs from field concentrations of chemical-biological agents, toxins, and radioactive fallout particles.  A mask consists of a silicone rubber facepiece with a filter canister.  The facepeice is equipped with front and side voicemitters, drink tube, and eye lenses.  Clear and neutral gray outserts protect the eye lenses and reduce glare and lens fogging.  A hood, not  permanently attached to the facepiece, provides protection of the head and neck.  A canvas carrier is provided with each mask for storing and carrying the mask and its accessories.  A waterproof bag is provided for temporary storage of the facepiece when required by climate and mission.  A faceform holds the facepiece in proper shape when stored longer than 30 days.  The mask is issued in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  In addition to the preceding, the M42A2 facepiece is connected to a filter cani ster (with carrier) or directly to the vehicle collective protection equipment by a corrugated hose.  A microphone and cable mounted to the facepiece allows interface with the vehicle communication system.  The silicone rubber facepiece fits closely agains t the face to form a seal. Air enters the canister and passes through an air deflector into the eye area of the facepiece.  The canister (screwed on to either the left or right side of the facepiece) filters out the CB agents, toxins, and radioactive parti cles.  From the eye area, air enters a nosecup and is inhaled through the nosecup valves.  Exhaled air passes through the nosecup area and is expelled through an outlet valve.  Outserts are fitted with a rubber ring, which hold them securely to the facepie ce eye lenses.  Optical inserts, available by medical prescription, are required for personnel who must wear glasses.  The mask does not protect the wearer from ammonia or carbon monoxide.  It is not effective where the amount of oxygen in the air is too l ow to support life.  Technical data packages are required for both masks and the facepiece.  Canisters will be supplied by the government.  This requirement is restricted to ILC Manufactured Products Division, Two Moonwalker Road, Frederica, DE 19946 and i s published for subcontracting purposes only.  Offers from concerns other than the above are not solicited. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis to large and small businesses.

Request for Proposals Notice for a Firm Fixed Price Contract for Interior & Exterior Renovations at the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Davenport, Iowa.  JOB PCN: RIA26520.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is: 236220 with the size standard of $28.5 million. Issue Request for Proposals:  on or about 11/23/05.  Receive Proposals: on or about 12/23/05.  Estimated Cost Range: $500,000 - $1,000,000.  Time for completion: 240 calendar days from the Notice To Proceed.  The Contractor shall provide all labor, material and disposal required to renovate the building’s interior and exterior as shown and as specified.  This work includes but not limited to, demolition, masonry and stone restoration and cleaning, concrete work, conveyance system doors and finishes, metal work, metal cleaning, wood restoration, and any associated electrical and mechanical work.  Lead paint abatement competency qualification information will be required to be submitted and approved prior to award.  Elevator competency qualification information will be required to be submitted and approved prior to award.

(b)  Cleaning and tuckpointing of all stone masonry, including cleaning of all bronze window frames and intermediate spandrels inherent in existing walls. (c)  Cleaning and tuckpointing of all parapet stone coping, including removal of flashing installation at low and high roof, and penthouse locations.

Refer to Section 04900-Masonry Restoration and Cleaning.  a. Multiplier:  One square foot.
This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 11/22/05.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 12/23/05.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions. 
 Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  
Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<DESC>Correction on the Dates and truncation error previously posted on Modification to Synopsis dated 8 Dec 2005.  Complete narrative of this synopsis can be found on the SPAWAR E-Commerce website (https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil). The U.S. Navy intends to procure on a full and open competitive basis approximately 100 Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) On Ship (MOS) Link 16 Systems for Shipboard, USMC Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) applications to be delivered during 2006-2011 at a rate of 2-3 per month. This notice updates and supplements information provided in the notice posted on 25 October 2005 for the same requirement. A draft RFP and Performance Specification will be available in early January 2006 with approximately 21 days to respond. The planned RFP issue date is in February 2006.  Offerors will be provided approximately 45 days to prepare proposals. An Industry Day may be held.   Contract award is scheduled for July 2006. Six distinct system configurations will be bought: 1) High-power MOS system for shipboard application; 2) Low-power MOS system for shipboard application; 3) High-power MOS system for shipboard application equipped with commercial crypto; 4) Low-power MOS system for shipboard application equipped with commercial crypto; 5) High-power Link 16 radio terminal set intended for use in non-shipboard applications; 6) Low-power Link 16 radio terminal set intended for use in non-shipboard applications. The scope of this contract will also cover Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), spares, maintenance and repair, documentation, configuration management, and some engineering. Award of a primarily Firm Fixed Price production contract is anticipated, with some Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) associated with First Article Qualification Test Requirements and ILS products.  Offerors must be able to begin delivery of fully qualified systems within 18 months of contract award. Award will be made to the best value offeror. The MOS production specification will have performance rather than design characteristics. However, all MOS systems delivered under the proposed contract shall be fully compatible and interchangeable with existing fielded systems.  No changes to host systems will be permitted. All systems must use a MIDS-LVT configuration that has been approved by the MIDS International Program Office at the time of contract award.  No changes to the MIDS-LVT hardware will be permitted.  Systems must be able to operate with GFP software.  No changes to the GFP software will be permitted without prior Government approval.  The draft RFP will be posted to the SPAWAR eCommerce site https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil, which, in turn, posts all notifications on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Government- wide Point of Entry  (fbo.gov).

<DESC>The US Army Field Support Command (AFSC) is seeking interested and qualified sources capable of producing (1) 25mm M793 TP-T cartridges (2) 25mm M910 TDPS-T cartridges (3) 25mm M794 Dummy cartridges and (4) 30mm M788 TP Cartridges.  This requirement is for the Governments fiscal years 2007  2011.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be limited to the National Technology Industrial Base.  Interested sources will be required to produce all rounds. The M793 and M910 will be procured to perform ance specifications.  The M794 and M788 will be procured to a US Government technical data package (TDP).  The M788 TDP is classified Distribution X - Limited distribution.  Distribution Statements X means the TDP cannot be distributed on the Internet and contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, USC, Sec 2751 et seq) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, USC App 2401, et seq.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 5230.25.  Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges.  The manufacturing process for these cartridges encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body metal parts, (2) production of propellants and trace mixes, (3) molding of plastic sabots and nose caps, (4) cartridge case priming and loading w/propellant and (5) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  For each step of the manufacturi ng process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment is required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  Experience in ballistic testing, expertise in the formulation and production of propellant, and process engineering experi ence relative to the LAP of these cartridges is essential.  An approved ballistic test range, M242 MANN barrels, M230 MANN barrels, M242 automatic guns and M230 automatic guns are required to perform first article and lot acceptance tests on these cartridg es.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic test equipment and metrology and metallurgy l aboratories.  Production of the various cartridges is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.

<SUBJECT>69 -- Training
<DESC>This is for informational purposes only.  An organizational proposal to establish a Division of Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP) within NCCDPHP from DACH’s Cardiovascular Health Branch (CVH) was submitted to the Management Analysis and Services Office (MASO) in May of 2005.  This organizational proposal will create new positions within DHDSP and will change many position descriptions of existing personnel. Leadership training, and Strategic planning is essential to successful transition of this organization from a Branch to a Division. 
 
Also, DACH is in the planning process of reorganizing the Aging Team of the Health Care and Aging Studies Branch to the Division Office of the Director.  This action will create new management positions, change the dynamics of the teams, and leave the existing Branch members to re-establish its mission and develop a new strategic plan for the Branch.  

In addition to the already mentioned need, the Division of Adult and Community Health has other new Division and Branch level senior management personnel team members thus changing the Division and Branch dynamics.  In order to fully embrace this change in personnel at both the Division and Branch level, team assessments and customized coaching are necessary.  This assessment will result in customized coaching and training for all team members at both the Division and Branch levels.

<SUBJECT>A -- Ultra-Wideband  Detecting and Tracking – Urban Eyes
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Ultra-Wideband Detecting and Tracking – Urban Eyes

Opportunity:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercially develop a system that utilizes advanced radar and signal processing techniques to detect and characterize moving objects behind opaque solid barriers.

Background: Urban Eyes provides capability to detect, locate, track and identify personnel behind obstructions from a standoff distance using ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensors in remote or other locations that do not necessarily provide communications infrastructure.  Using this technology, LLNL deployed a search team to the World Trade Center after 9/11, and recently worked with first response FEMA task force teams to search for living victims of the recent hurricane Katrina disaster aftermath in New Orleans. Fire, police, military, and emergency response teams have already expressed an active interest in acquiring the device.

Description:  Urban Eyes is a portable system using return radar signals to track motions through light construction materials (sheetrock, two-by-four frame construction, etc.) and rubble. It consists of small, light-weight micropower-impulse radar (MIR) UWB sensors and a wired or wireless visual display.  Signal and image processing algorithms are applied to digitized radar return signals and used to triangulate and locate moving objects.  Motion characteristics at the location of the moving subject can then be analyzed.  A spectral estimation algorithm is then applied to provide an estimate of the human heartbeat and respiration signature (HRS).

Advantages:
•	Man portable with single backpack deployment
•	It can “see” through wood, reinforced concrete, sheetrock, smoke, debris.
•	Demonstrated to detect motion up to 25 feet through multiple walls 
•	Very effective through rubble or walls reinforced with rebar
•	Detects small movements such as hand waving, postural sway, and respiration 
•	A single sensor tracks motion and location in one dimension, while dual sensors track motion and location in two dimensions.
•	Low power operation (>4 hour battery lifetime)
•	Easy to interpret displays (no training required), refresh rate >30 frames/s
•	Standoff capability using remote wireless display of up to 0.5 km


Potential Applications:  Applications include: search and rescue, facility monitoring, home security, medical and patient monitoring, monitoring of athletic activity, police actions, hostage situations, identifying terrorist movements, troop and soldier monitoring, urban warfare, monitoring of prisoners, transportation security, industrial security.

Development Status:  A Patent Applications have been filed. The device has performed well in difficult environments, however, it may require improved packaging and ruggedization to meet the appropriate technical readiness level for deployment with first responder teams. Additional technical information available at 
http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/UrbanEyes.php

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's UWB Detecting and Tracking Technology -Urban Eyes should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.  Company Name and address.
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

<SUBJECT>99 -- SECC, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION and INDUSTRY DAY/RISK ASSESSMENT WORKSHOP
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
And 
INDUSTRY DAY/RISK ASSESSMENT WORKSHOP
SUPPORT EQUIPMENT COMMODITY COUNCIL
WR-ALC

The Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC) located at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to obtain industry input on the development of our current strategy.  This continuing interaction with industry is for the purpose of obtaining direct inputs from industry that will allow continued refinement of the requirement.  Based on the inputs received, the information will be used as a basis for a final industry day/risk analysis for development of the final acquisition strategy.  An Industry Day/Risk Assessment workshop will be held at Robins AFB in Warner Robins GA on 18 Jan 06.  

The following is the outline of the strategy for which inputs are requested:

The SECC proposes to award Third Party Logistics (3PL) contracts which provide service to the Government to support items with an anticipated unit cost of less than $10K.  The analysis performed on the items in this category indicate that the total body of items represent 2-4% of total annual spend but generate 62% of annual contract actions.  The current available forecast for the period FY06 – FY08 includes approximately 1600 items in the category of low-price, sporadic demand items.  The population of items has been reviewed and the SECC proposes three separate 3PL contracts.  Each proposed contract action will be set-aside for small businesses.  There will be a specific group of items set aside in separate competitions for HubZone entities, 8(a) entities, and a small business set-aside.  The SECC has previously published potential lists of items for this analysis based upon the three separate potential contract actions.   This information can be found at:  http://pkec.robins.af.mil/SECC/SECC.htm.  Each contract is expected to be a FFP (Firm-Fixed-Price), ID/IQ (Indefinite Deliver/Indefinite Quantity) type of contract.  A DRAFT copy of a notional Statement of Requirements (SOR) for the effort will be posted at the website in early Jan 06.  A separate source selection will be conducted for the award of each 3PL contract.

The SECC requests your input to these specific issues regarding the proposed strategy:

1.  NAICS code 541614 (Processes, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) is proposed for each contract.  Are there other NAICS codes that industry believes are more appropriate for this type of contract?

2.	The 3PL contractor will be the provider for the items accountable under the individual contracts.   The cost for this “service” will most likely be passed along to the government in the form of a surcharge or embedded in the item cost.  The amount added to each item delivered to the Government will then constitute the total cost of the item.  Is there an industry standard (range) for this type of service (surcharge or cost additive) in an ID/IQ FFP environment?

3.	We are considering implementing PBL (performance based logistics) metrics, such as:  on-time delivery, cost controls, quality, and ensuring other small business objectives in accordance with established goals in the contracts.   Due to the wide diversity of items identified for each 3PL contract, what constraints or risks does Industry believe will negatively impact meeting these objectives?






4.	Issues regarding pricing, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), source selection criteria and evaluation, acquisition schedule, and other issues which affect the strategy (and ultimately the solicitation) will also be discussed.  This is an opportunity for industry representatives to interact with the SECC team members to make further recommendations, identify any potential obstacles or risks, and propose recommendations to outstanding issues regarding the actions to be taken.  Please feel free to raise relevant issues and we will make allowances to address them at the Industry Day/Risk Assessment Workshop.  

5.	The workshop will be held at Robins AFB in Warner Robins GA on 18 Jan 06 from 8 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.  Additional information, including an agenda, will be published at the website referenced above, no later than 10 Jan 06.  The purpose of the workshop is to provide all available information to industry regarding the proposed strategy to support the acquisition.  


The conference will be held in Building 376, Room 404.  The facility allows anonymous interaction with the SECC team.  Industry representatives will have the ability to pose questions without revealing the source of the issue/question and all responses will be provided to the group.  Seats at the facility are limited and only one representative from each company will have access to the anonymous computer capability (there are 30 computer seats).  The room will accommodate up to 60 people.  Reservations will be made on a first-come, first-confirmed basis.  Contact Linda Ralston at linda.ralston@robins.af.mil to confirm reservations.  All reservations must be made no later than 12 Jan 06.  Industry recommendations on agenda topics or issues on the strategy or requirement may also be provided to Linda Ralston at the above email address prior to the conference.  If based on participation or agenda topics additional time is required, the session may be extended through 19 Jan 06.  Notification will be posted to the website and provided directly to registered participants if the additional time is deemed to be necessary.  The POC for this action is Linda Ralston, 478-222-3775.

<OFFADD>US Army Engineer District, New York, CENAN-CT, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY  10278-0090
<SUBJECT>--The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District has a need for brand name only equipment for fire alarm radio transceivers.
<DESC>The New York District intends to solicit and award a construction project for Fort Drum, NY, entitled Divtroop Barracks. The project will be solicited competitively under a future solicitation. This project includes a Brand Name Only component. This notification serves three purposes: (1) to notify potential offerors of the Armys intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction project and (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and (3) noti fication of the Armys intent to sole source a Brand Name Only, system, Monaco as described below. The Monaco system is embedded in the Construction project, which projects will be issued competitively. Only that part of the project requiring the Monaco sys tem will be sole source if no sources are able to provide a compatible system. In the event no compatible equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source. The synopsis is for planning purp oses and is not a solicitation. This synopsis is the only document that will be published notifying potential offerors of the governments intent. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT: The project includes Brand Name only equipment for building fire alarm radio transceiv ers manufactured by Monaco Enterprises. These projects with their many state-of-the-art building components require reliable receiving and reporting building fire alarm systems. It has been determined that a microprocessor based radio controlled fire repor ting system is the best and the most economical alternative to be compatible with the existing system. Fort Drum currently uses the Monaco D-700 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System. These projects include multiple buildings with varying requirements. Since  multiple transceivers will be required, two models have been determined to be acceptable, and the appropriate model will be selected per individual building requirements. The Monaco Enterprises Inc. BT2-7 Building Transceiver, and BT2-8 Building Transceiv er are the equipment best suited to meet the needs of Fort Drum. The BT2-7 and BT2-8 Fire Alarm Building Transceivers are functionally designed for specific Government fire department operations. Monaco Enterprise Inc. provides 24/7 technical support and i n-service training of Installation personnel for operation and maintenance inclusive. It is paramount that this system be carefully coordinated to maintain overall system integrity and capabilities. The required features of the BT2-7 and BT2-8 Fire Alarm B uilding Transceivers are as follows: -Integrated Radio transmission of alarms, troubles, and restorations for up to 16 (BT2-7) or 32 (BT2-8) zones -Output RF power 4 watts minimum -Narrowband radio transmission -BT2 address is set by DIP or rotary switches ; zone identification numbers only needed to be entered at the D-700. -Communication with the D-700 is supervised and status changes are reported by automatic and manual poll/reply/acknowledge routines. -Battery fault (low or disconnected battery or abnorm al charger output), ac fail conditions and restorations reported with the BT2 number; ac fail reporting may be inhibited. -LEDs identify BT2 and zone status; detectable audible alert sounds for alarms and troubles. -Zone inputs may be disabled at the D-700  -Programmed diagnostic tests -Integral battery disconnect circuitry prevents battery damage due to prolonged discharge. -Automatic transmitter disconnect for stuck transmitter -Integral battery backup and charging circuitry for 60 hours continuous operati on. -Current status is stored in nonvolatile, transferable Data Module Any vendor wishing to provide a system that is compatible with the existing Monaco system must provide a copy of its brochure and any other data by 23 December 2005 to Scott Helmer, U.S . Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, New York, NY 10278. This is a market survey and notification of  intent only. This is not a request to respond to a solicitation. This project will be solicited at a future date.

<DESC>Request for Proposal
<BR><BR>
Pointe du Hoc Stabilization Study, Normandy France
<BR><BR>
Project Information
<BR><BR>
This is a Request for Proposal issued by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC.)  Firms are invited to submit proposals for the Pointe du Hoc Stabilization Study, Normandy France.  The Pointe du Hoc area contains many significant structures that are important to the history of WWII.  The entire area sits on top of a 100 ft cliff that overlooks the English Channel.  The cliff is not stable and has eroded significantly since the end of the war.  Because of the stability problem, the public is no longer allowed access to the bunker or to the historic monument that sits on top.  A study is needed to determine the stability of the area and to identify the rate of deterioration with the final goal of determining if any remediation is possible.  The study should include mapping of the area so that historically significant information is not lost if the area stabilization is not possible resulting in eventual loss of the bunker and its memorial due to erosion.
<BR><BR>
Scope of Work:
<BR><BR>
1.	Conduct a study of the Pointe du Hoc area in the vicinity of the observation bunker and the monument.  The study should look at the types of natural forces that are causing the deterioration of the area including, but not limited to, rain run off, wind erosion, settling, and wave action at the base of the cliff.  The study should identify the rate of deterioration and suggested means of long term stabilization including estimated cost of such a project.  Contractor to provide a preliminary assessment by end of Sept. 2006.  Final report date with any suggested remedial action to be provided by the contractor.
<BR>
2.	Map the Pointe du Hoc area to identify historically significant details for posterity.  This mapping will be important if the area is allowed to deteriorate to a pointe that collapse into the sea occurs.  Contractor to provide a proposed schedule.
<BR>
3.	The Contractor shall develop a general outline for each study. Each outline shall be accompanied by a schedule designed to meet the ABMC deadline for all completed products.
<BR>
4.	The Contractor shall obtain all approvals and permits required for the studies from the French Government.
<BR><BR>
Note: The study should take into account the host nation and veteran’s group sensitivities.  Any remedial action, if possible, would have to be approved by the French government.  Any potential invasive testing (bore hole sampling etc) must be approved by the French government and must take care not to destroy any buried artifacts or architecture.  Any remedial action should try to maintain the natural look and feel of the area as much as possible.
<BR><BR>
Proposal response Date
<BR><BR>
Proposal is due by close of business Jan. 13, 2006.
<BR><BR>
Contact Information
<BR><BR>
Responses may be sent by post, express delivery, or e-mail attachment.  If sent by e-mail, all materials should be included in a single .pdf file.

If so, the government would inquire into the availability of any additional unit(s) at least thirty (30) days in advance.  These unit(s) would only be required as requested.

STATEMENT OF WORK: 

This is a request for quote to provide on call remedial maintenance and preventive maintenance for four IRS owned White power files, two model number 72141E, one model number 72141W and one Model Number 72200K.  The IRS wants to enter into an agreement with a company that will provide unscheduled repairs, including repair parts, to the equipment when needed in addition to providing preventive maintenance in accordance with Manufacturer specifications at least twice per year.


Preventive maintenance shall be performed in accordance with manufacturer specification and include, as a minimum, cleaning, oiling and necessary adjustments.  It will be scheduled via mutual agreement between the IRS and Contractor.  


On-call service includes parts and repair of failed equipment.  Historically, on-call service has been minimal, with no calls made in the last two years.  Vendor is expected to respond to calls the same day if notified prior to 12 Noon or no later than the following morning for calls made after 12 Noon.  Service hours are Monday - Friday 8:00am through 4:00 PM.  


The vendor will coordinate with a designated IRS Point of contact to schedule preventive maintenance.   A designated IRS Point of Contact will notify Vendor if remedial maintenance is required.  IRS points of contact will be designated at time of award.


Contractor Performance:  Contractor’s performance under this contract will be evaluated by the IRS end users.  The evaluation will be based on IRS  monitoring of Vendor’s performance to ensure that required PM’s and repairs are performed.  Failure to perform required tasks may result in payment reduction.


Required tasks and standards are:
(1)  Contractor coordinates with the end user to establish a mutually agreeable schedule for performance of preventive maintenance and performs maintenance in accordance with the schedule.

(2)  Contractor responds to request for repairs the same day or the next day and that repairs made are adequate to return equipment to proper working condition.


Contractor’s failure to comply with the above may result in reduction in payment.  If reductions in payment are applied they will be calculated as described below.   


If contractor performs PM one or more days after the agreed on date, or reports the next day, or later, after being notified in the morning of a repair, a reduction equal to one day of service for each day that contractor is late may be imposed.  Any reductions will be based on the agreed on price for service. The payment will be reduced by a prorated amount for each day that the service is not performed plus 10% administrative fee. The daily rate will be computed by dividing the periodic rate by the number of work days in the period, i.e., the quarterly rate will be divided by 65 (13 weeks X 5 workdays per week).  


The contract is for 5 years, consisting of a base period that begins January 1, 2006 and four one year options beginning January 1, 2007.


Addendum to FAR Clause 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL 

1.  Offeror will submit a quarterly price for the base period January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and each option period as identified in the price schedule.

The quarterly price will be Contractor’s annual price divided by four.  In arriving at the price Offeror should consider the cost of preventative maintenance and estimated/possible cost for remedial repairs.  Include in your proposal an explanation of any limitations or what is included in your estimated cost for remedial repairs.  

2.  Offeror will provide a brief statement (one to two paragraphs) addressing his ability to provide the maintenance and include the names and contact information of one to three references who will attest to offeror’s ability to perform maintenance on this type equipment and Offeror’s reliability.  


Addendum to FAR Clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  

Two factors will be considered in evaluating quotes. The first factor, demonstrated ability to perform required work and reliability, is more important than the second factor, price.  The IRS will use the information provided in Vendor’ statement addressing his ability to provide the maintenance (see item 2 above) to evaluate offeror’s ability to perform work and reliability.
