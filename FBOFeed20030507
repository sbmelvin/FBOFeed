<DESC>The goal of the Command & Control and Combat System (C2 & CS) Program is to develop science and technology enablers for decision-making and mission execution to achieve battlespace superiority.  

A critical capability in network centric operations is achieving a high level of situational awareness that is present at all levels of warfare (strategic, operational, tactical) regardless of the constitution of forces (naval, joint, coalition, or combined).  To realize this critical capability, the C2 & CS Program will focus on advanced or novel approaches for processing and integration of information from disparate sources; optimal decision aids incorporating rigorous decision theory and automated inference and reasoning; and assuring information integrity and availability according to mission objectives.

<DESC>LifeLog, SOL BAA 03-30, Proposals Due: Initial Closing: Mon., June 23, 2003, Final Closing: Fri., May 7, 2004, POC: Dr. Doug Gage, DARPA/IPTO; FAX: (703) 741-7804.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION.  The Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals to develop an ontology-based (sub)system that captures, stores, and makes accessible the flow of one person's experience in and interactions with the world in order to support a broad spectrum of associates/assistants and other system capabilities.  The objective of this "LifeLog" concept is to be able to trace the "threads" of an individual's life in terms of events, states, and relationships.  Functionally, the LifeLog (sub)system consists of three components: data capture and storage, representation and abstraction, and data access and user interface.  LifeLog accepts as input a number of raw physical and transactional data streams.  Through inference and reasoning, LifeLog generates multiple layers of representation at increasing levels of abstraction.  The input data streams are abstracted into sequences of events and states, which are aggregated into threads and episodes to produce a timeline that constitutes an "episodic memory" for the individual.  Patterns of events in the timeline support the identification of routines, relationships, and habits.  Preferences, plans, goals, and other markers of intentionality are at the highest level.  LifeLog is interested in three major data categories: physical data, transactional data, and context or media data.  "Anywhere/anytime" capture of physical data might be provided by hardware worn by the LifeLog user.  Visual, aural, and possibly even haptic sensors capture what the user sees, hears, and feels.  GPS, digital compass, and inertial sensors capture the user's orientation and movements.  Biomedical sensors capture the user's physical state.  LifeLog also captures the user's computer-based interactions and transactions throughout the day from email, calendar, instant messaging, web-based transactions, as well as other common computer applications, and stores the data (or, in some cases, pointers to the data) in appropriate formats.  Voice transactions can be captured through recording of telephone calls and voice mail, with the called and calling numbers as metadata.  FAX and hardcopy written material (such as postal mail) can be scanned.  Finally, LifeLog also captures (or at least captures pointers to) the tremendous amounts of context data the user is exposed to every day from diverse media sources, including broadcast television and radio, hardcopy newspapers, magazines, books and other documents, and softcopy electronic books, web sites, and database access.  LifeLog can be used as a stand-alone system to serve as a powerful automated multimedia diary and scrapbook.  By using a search engine interface, the user can easily retrieve a specific thread of past transactions, or recall an experience from a few seconds ago or from many years earlier in as much detail as is desired, including imagery, audio, or video replay of the event.  Additional LifeLog applications are discussed in the PIP.  LifeLog technology will support the long-term IPTO vision of a new class of truly "cognitive" systems that can reason in a variety of ways, using substantial amounts of appropriately represented knowledge; can learn from experiences so that their performance improves as they accumulate knowledge and experience; can explain their actions and can accept direction; can be aware of their own behavior and reflect on their own capabilities; and can respond in a robust manner to surprises.  TASK AREAS.  This solicitation seeks proposals to develop and demonstrate LifeLog system-level capabilities as described in the following tasks: Task 1. Representation and Abstraction via Reasoning and Inference.  The research focus of the LifeLog program is the appropriate placement of transactional and physical data within an appropriate framework of representations and abstractions to make accessible both the flow of the user's physical experiences in the world and the stream of his or her interactions with other entities in the world.  For transactional data, this process of representation and abstraction might begin with the association of metadata with each data item (e.g., the header information in an email or the information on the envelope of a physical letter).  Physical data streams generally have to be parsed into meaningful "chunks," such as "saccadic" scenes of video, motion segments in GPS or inertial data, or segments of one person's speech in audio, and these chunks have to be labeled.  The key challenge of LifeLog is to make sense of this ongoing sequence of multi-modal transactions and labeled chunks of physical data, by sorting it into discrete "events" and "states" (whose transitions are marked by events) and "threads" (consisting of sequences of events and states) and "episodes" (with beginnings and ends), and to do this automatically and recursively until an extended episode can be identified and labeled as, for example, "I took the 08:30 a.m. flight from Washington's Reagan National Airport to Boston's Logan Airport."  The representational path from the raw physical sensor inputs to this high-level description includes concepts of walking, standing, and riding, being indoors and outdoors, being "at home," taking a taxi, and going through airport security.  The task can be made considerably easier because LifeLog can also process a "going to Boston" entry in the calendar program, email from the airline telling that the flight is on time, and a phone call ordering the taxi, and can correlate GPS readings to a COTS street map.  Beyond the generation of the user's individual timeline or history, represented as a structure of labeled threads and episodes, LifeLog will be able to find meaningful patterns in the timeline, to infer the user's routines, habits, and relationships with other people, organizations, places, and objects, and to exploit these patterns to ease its task.  The proposal should describe in detail exactly how the offeror's LifeLog system will accomplish this process of "tracing the threads" and "telling the story" of the user's experience.  State how physical sensory inputs will be parsed and classified (labelled).  Define the metadata to be used for each type of input data.  Describe how the representation hierarchy is to be constructed, and how classification of events, states, etc., will be performed.  Explicitly address the extraction of patterns such as routines, habits, and relationships.  Present an approach for assessing the contribution of each data source proposed to LifeLog system-level performance.  Provide a comparison of the relative importance of human knowledge engineering and machine learning components both during system development and when deployed.  Discuss the tools to be provided to the user to support the visualization and manual generation and editing of the representational hierarchy.  Task 2:  Data Capture and Storage Subsystem.  LifeLog must acquire data to capture both the user's physical experiences in the world and his or her interactions with other entities in the world.  The specific types and fidelity of data to be captured should be driven by the needs implied by the offeror's approach to Task 1.  Physical data is captured by various physical sensors and is stored as multiple data streams in appropriate formats at appropriate resolutions.  Transactional data is extracted principally from a number of computer applications.  Detectors, recognizers, analysis tools, and heuristics are used to "distill" the data, associating metadata, flagging keywords, and otherwise preparing the data for further categorization in terms of representations at various levels of abstraction.  Data capture capability must be adequate to support the development of LifeLog, but should not involve new development of sensors.  The proposal should identify the sources and modalities of physical, transactional, and context/media data to be captured, and also the specific sensors and deployment (e.g., wearable) means to be used for gathering physical data, and the methods to be used to acquire transactional and context/media data.  The proposal should identify the data storage components to be employed and provide an estimate of the volume of data of each type to be stored per unit time.  Selection rationale for components, including critical specifications and estimated costs, should be presented.  LifeLog system integration should be specifically addressed, together with power and endurance issues.  Offerors must also address human subject approval, data privacy and security, copyright, and legal considerations that would affect the LifeLog development process.  Leverage of existing hardware and software is highly encouraged, and LifeLog should interface to commonly used computer applications.  Task 3.  Data Access and User Interface Subsystem.  The initial LifeLog prototype implementation must provide a functional Application Programming Interface (API), as well as a stand-alone user data access capability which is envisioned to be a search-engine style interface allowing functions (e.g., less than, greater than, Booleans) of the various metadata parameters.  Offerors should propose additional features to enhance the user interface (e.g., timeline displays) and to augment the API to support use by additional applications.  The developmental interface should also provide a query capability to enable the user to learn why the system behaved as it did.  In addition, the interface should provide intervention tools to enable the user to manually create metadata, assign classifications, and edit the abstraction hierarchy.  The capabilities of the proposed access scheme should be described in terms of the flexibility of access queries to be supported (of primary concern) and expected performance, such as response time.  Leveraging of existing software is encouraged, since the user interface is not a principal subject of research for LifeLog.  Task 4: Experimentation and Performance Assessment.  The successful development of LifeLog will require extensive experimentation to provide both the system and its developers with enough "experience" to be representative of use in the real world.  The first LifeLog users will clearly be the developer team itself, and, once a critical initial threshold of capability has been achieved, the results of this use should be documented as longitudinal studies.  Operating conditions should not be controlled, and a broad spectrum of both physical and transactional data should be captured over weeks of continuous real-world use.  The proposal should address performance assessment over these longitudinal studies, and address the metrics of completeness of the ontology and correctness of the LifeLog's classification decisions.  The LifeLog program also includes a "Challenge Problem" in the form of a system demonstration while taking a trip to Washington D.C.  Travel combines physical activity (movement via a variety of conveyances) and a diversity of transactions (email, calendar, financial, itinerary, etc.) over the course of a trip.  The Travel Challenge consists of an uncontrolled trip from the user's home to Washington, plus controlled trials involving travel over a government-prescribed course within the D.C. area, each trial lasting less than one day.  Each proposer is encouraged to have at least three (3) LifeLog users participate in the Travel Challenge.  Proposals should include plans for participation in these experiments, specifically including a plan for measuring the performance of the LifeLog system in terms of correctness and completeness.  These metrics are defined in detail in the PIP.  The results of the Travel Challenge will be a major determinant of the scope and course of future LifeLog development, including the exercise of proposed options.  Offerors should also propose other challenge activities in addition to the Travel Challenge to demonstrate and assess the richness of the LifeLog representation structure and complexity of the domain (task and environment).  Additional metrics should also be proposed.  Task 5: Options for Advanced LifeLog Development.  The base efforts solicited by this BAA address critical issues that must be tackled to demonstrate a basic LifeLog capability.  However, many other equally critical and challenging issues must be addressed to realize a fully deployable LifeLog (sub)system.  Therefore, the proposal may include one or more options to perform additional work addressing relevant technical questions, including but not limited to the following: (a) How should the LifeLog system enforce security and privacy, given that different data sources may require different restrictions (i.e., classified, proprietary, privacy act) on each data element, and a given item of data may be acquired from more than one source?  (b) How should different people's LifeLog systems interact with each other?  For example, if each person's LifeLog understands only his/her own speech perfectly, how should multiple LifeLogs share information so that each can acquire and store all parts of a conversation?  (c) How should LifeLog be implemented so that it can degrade gracefully in its access modes, storage resources, and capture capabilities?  (d) How can the domain of intentionality (plans and goals) above the level of timeline or history be more fully developed so that LifeLog can effectively support the broadest possible spectrum of assistive and training applications?  Proposed options should include a clear statement of the functionality and performance benefits envisioned, and should define metrics to support the assessment of these benefits.  PROGRAM SCOPE.  This solicitation seeks proposals that address the development of system-level LifeLog capabilities and which fully address Tasks 1 through 4.  A proposal that instead focuses on one or more specific individual technologies will be considered, but to be successful it must make a clearly convincing case that the effort would provide an extremely high payoff.  Proposed efforts should cover a base 18-month period of performance and may include one or more options, whose period of performance should not exceed 24 months.  The project schedule must include an initial kick-off meeting, an engineering design review 6 months after award to approve the architecture and implementation plan, a Principal Investigators' Meeting 9 months after award, and a final project review associated with the Travel Challenge, 16 months after award.  Up to four awards are anticipated, and teaming is highly encouraged.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  The establishment of LifeLog as an approved DARPA program is dependent upon the quality of the responses to this BAA.  GENERAL INFORMATION.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requires completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  This cover sheet can be accessed at the following URL: http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=03-30  After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If a proposer intends on submitting more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for electronic submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  See Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) for further details.  PROPOSAL FORMAT.  Proposers must submit an original and 3 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, 100 MB Iomega Zip disk or cd).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-30, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and "Copy <n> of 2".  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 PM (ET) Mon., June 23, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 03-30, LifeLog will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) Fri., May 7, 2004. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Fri., May 7, 2004. While the proposals submitted after the Fri., June 23, 2003, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 03-30 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstracts, and full proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/index.html.  Abstracts and proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-30 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling. The technical concept should be clearly defined, developed and defensibly innovative. Emphasis should be placed on the technical excellence of the development and experimentation approach.  (2) Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem:  Proposed efforts should apply new or existing technology in an innovative way such as is advantageous to the objectives.  The plan on how the offeror intends to get developed technology artifacts and information to the user community should be considered.  The offeror shall specify quantitative experimental methods and metrics by which the proposed technical effort's progress shall be measured.  (3) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/IPTO Mission:  The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will meet the goals of the undertaking and how the proposed effort contributes to significant advances to the DARPA/IPTO mission.  (4) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience:  The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.  (5) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition:  The offeror should provide a clear explanation of how the technologies to be developed will be transitioned to capabilities for military forces.  Technology transition should be a major consideration in the design of experiments, particularly considering the potential for involving potential transition organizations in the experimentation process.  (6) Cost Realism:  The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be clearly shown as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation will consider the value to Government of the research and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.  Cost is considered a substantial evaluation criterion but secondary to technical excellence.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, must be received at one of the administrative addresses below by 12:00 NOON (EST) Fri., April 30, 2004; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for some of the correspondence regarding BAA 03-30.  Proposals MUST NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  All proposals, administrative correspondence, and questions submitted in response to this solicitation must be in the English language.  Submissions received in other than English shall be rejected.  Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor.  This support contractor is prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only."  While non-government personnel may review proposals, contractors will not be used to conduct evaluations or analyses of any aspect of a proposal submitted under this BAA, unless one of the three conditions identified in FAR 37.203(d) applies.  The administrative addresses for this BAA are: Fax: (703) 741-7804 Addressed to: DARPA/IPTO, BAA 03-30, Electronic Mail: baa03-30@darpa.mil, Electronic File Retrieval: http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/index.html, Mail to: DARPA/IPTO, ATTN:  BAA 03-30, 3701 N.

<DESC>NA This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are cons idered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. THE FULL BAA, DISCUSSION OF EVALUATION FACTORS, AND REQUIRED FORMS ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.SMDC.ARMY.MIL. USASMDC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those areas covered in Part I of this BAA. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Funding of research within USASMDC areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.  Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the USASMDC technical point of con tact, identified below, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to submission of a concept paper or proposal.  The recommended four-step sequence is an initial contact, summary concept paper, proposal and contract award for selected projects.  This se quence allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported. This BAA consists of four parts as follows: Part I      -    Research Interests Part II     -    Proposal Preparation and Submission Part III    -    Proposal Evaluation Part IV    -     Proposal Forms THOSE SUBMITTING PROPOSALS ARE CAUTIONED THAT ONLY A CONTRACTING OFFICER CAN OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ANY AGREEMENT INVOLVING EXPENDITURE OF GOVERNMENT FUNDS. This BAA shall  remain in effect until May 15, 2005 or until superseded. USASMDC points of contact: The USASDMC technical POC for this BAA is Mr. Richard Runyan who may be reached by email, Richard.Runyan@smdc.army.mil.   The contracts POC is Ms. Patricia Vail who may be reached at (256) 955-2688 or e-mail, Patricia.Vail@smdc.army.mil.	 	In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation.  From this summary conc ept paper the government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Kinetic Energy Interceptor Directorate and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed.   The government, at its option, may provide comme nts that might be of assistance to the offeror in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal.  Offerors are not required to submit concept papers nor are they precluded by the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s advice on a concept paper from submitting a formal pr oposal. Summary concept papers will be accepted from the 1st to the 15th of each month. They should be sent to:          US Army Space and Missile Defense Command         ATTN:  SMDC-CM-AK/Patricia Vail 	P.O. Box 1500 	Huntsville, AL  35807-3801 	Email address: Patricia.Vail@smdc.army.mil   (preferred method of receipt) The Kinetic Energy Interceptor Directorate will review the concept paper and the contracting officer  respond to the offeror by email not more than 20 days after receipt of the concept paper.  The summary concept paper should, in summary, capture the propo sed technical concept together with its rationale and objectives, methodology, the expected results, and its contribution to the USASMDC.  Also included should be a period of performance and anticipated cost. The concept paper is normally limited to 2 page s (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary.  Please include a POCs email address on the concept paper.  A review of concept papers by USA SMDC engineers will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal.  If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested.  All proposals, written communications, or documentation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the mailing address as above.   Proposals submitted in response to this BAA may be for a period of performance up to 48 months. Such long-term proposals should contain a brief summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire fou r year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor category. Include cost data for each task. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort type contracts are expected to be awarded. For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $2.5M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 18 months.  In addi tion  to the basic contract, contract options can be proposed.  The total  period of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 4 years.  This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report.  Any awards resulting fro m this announcement are subject to the availability of funds in FY04 and succeeding years.  	 PART I RESEARCH INTERESTS 	The Kinetic Energy Interceptor Directorate is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors capable of satisfying the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s needs on research to advance its capability in missile defense interceptor technologies. Proposals with new or un ique ideas which enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge are solicited.  Proposals should address the technical areas listed below:  KINETIC ENERGY INTERCEPTOR TECHNOLOGIES 		A. Seekers 		B. Guidance, Navigation, and Control 		C. Propulsion and Divert & Attitude Control Systems (DACS)                             D.  Avionics 		E. Windows and Structures 		F. Innovative Algorithm Concepts  		        Applicable to Interceptors  		G. Other Applicable Interceptor Technologies Part II - PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION Part II is intended to provide information needed in preparing research proposals for submission to USASMDC. Both prospective principal investigators and business office personnel will find it useful. Most of the information needed by the personnel preparing the proposal will be found in Section 2 of this part.  Blank proposal forms, included in Part IV of this BAA, are designed to provide all required information needed for contracting purposes. Use of  the proposal forms will expedite award of the research contract. Organizations or individuals interested in submitting research proposals to USASDMC should make preliminary inquiries on the general need for the type of research effort contemplated before expending extensive time and effort in preparing a detailed resear ch proposal. A formal proposal should present the proposed research effort in sufficient detail to allow USASMDC to evaluate the scientific merit and relevance of the proposed research. There is no page limit on formal proposals. USASMDC encourages nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, historically black colleges and universities, minority institutions, small business, and small disadvantaged business concerns to submit research proposals for consideration. 1. GENERAL INFORMATION 	It is requested that no classified data be included in proposals or concept papers. SET ASIDE TOPICS 	The topic Ã¢Â€ÂœInnovative Algorithm Concepts applicable to Interceptors,Ã¢Â€Â has been set aside for small business and Historically Black College/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI).  The same evaluation criteria as stated in this announce ment will be used to select offers under the set-aside and non set-aside portions.

PROJECT NUMBER: GS-03P-03-QFM-0049 
UILDING NAME: WM. J. NEALON F/B & CTHSE.   
A/E: HEMMLER & CAMAYD ARCHITECTS 


This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

Any offeror having problems during a DPE must notify the Contracting Office at FISC San Diego immediately. A "problem" is an event that interferes with the Offeror's ability to participate in the DPE and includes, but is not limited to, Internet connection and re-connection difficulties, (2) software or hardware failures, and (3) erroneous data entry errors. Offerors will have    5  minutes after the DPE goes into the "Quiet Period" status to notify the Contracting Office of  any problems.

D.	AFTER THE DPE  1.	Closing Price Discussions. Discussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Co ntracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3.	Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS.  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This is a two-step design/build construction project,  Request for Proposals, Number N68950-03-R-0029.

It is the intent and objective of the Government to obtain services including all labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required for design and construction of a new Naval Reserve Center at the Minnesota Air National Guard Base, Duluth, MN.  The building will consist of approximately 11,000 SF of administrative spaces including a drill hall with a size of approximately 2,800 square feet.  The project includes all parking, sidewalks, drives, and utility connections to provide a complete and useable facility.  The estimated cost of the entire project is in the range of $3,000,000.00 to $4,000,000.00. The NAICS Code is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.) The Small Business size standard is $28.5 million. The government desires the number of days for completion for the design and construction of the facility not-to-exceed 425 calendar days.  

The solicitation, when issued, will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and P-68 for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing the authorized Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides best value to the Government.  In accordance with FAR 36.3, this procurement will consist of two phases and can be summarized as follows:

Phase I.  Proposals will be evaluated on:
a.  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience for the Design & Construction Teams.
b.  Technical Qualifications (Design/Construction and Management Approach)

Phase II.  A maximum of five (5) offerors will advance to Phase II.  The Proposals will be evaluated on:
a.  Technical Proposal
b.  Price Proposal

A solicitation for phase 1 is expected to be released by May 21, 2003 with a closing date of June 11, 2003.  Contractor proposals for phase 2 will be due approximately 45 calendar days after RFP issue date.  After receipt of phase 2 proposal packages, the Government may choose to award based on this initial proposal without discussions.  If required, in accordance with FAR 15.306, clarifications and discussions may be enacted, and a final revised proposal will  be requested.

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all offers at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; to award to the offeror submitting the highest technically rated or the lowest total price proposal and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to be the most advantageous “Best Value” to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  

Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the offerors will be required to submit technical solutions and a price proposal for the project.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the project and other submittals that address factors defining the quality of construction.  Price proposals will include total evaluated price, including evaluation of scope/design options within the Government’s published budget for award, and an evaluation of change order markups and overhead.  The “BEST VALUE” proposal for the project will be awarded the project.   Unsuccessful offerors participating in Phase II of the project will not be eligible to receive stipends or compensation for proposal preparation costs. Offers will not be publicly opened.  The number of offers received, the identity of offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers will not be disclosed to anyone until the time of contract award.

The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for Phase I and Phase II through the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.   All prospective offerors and plan rooms MUST register themselves on the website.  The official planholders list will be created from the internet registration and will be available from the website only.  Amendments will be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method of distributing amendments, therefore, it is the offeror’s responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.

Approximately 100 feet of rigid pipe shall be supplied for the NPS to install in the vertical position at the beginning of the pumping work.  The rigid line shall remain in position until the end of the work, and then it shall be returned to the pump supplier.  A flexible line, approximately 75 feet long shall be installed on the end of the rigid line, for use in placing the concrete in the voids.  The total number of days and quantities of concrete pumped each day is indefinite.  This is due to the variables of work methods, locations of the voids, concrete curing time, availability/quantity of concrete delivery and pumping capacity.  The total quantity of concrete to be pumped will be between 516 cubic yards and 967 cubic yards.  The total number of days may be between 4 days and 20 days within a 2 week to 8 week period.  Pumping quantities may vary from a minimum of 5 cubic yards and 500 cubic yards a day.  All bids will be evaluated and award will be based on the best value to the government.  Best value will be determined by lowest bid, availability, pumping capacity, and rental cost of rigid line.  Mobilization and any mileage costs shall be included in the cost of pumping service, either per day or per cubic yard. Submit proposals based on concrete specifications of: minimum compressive strength of 3000 psi; maximum aggregate size of 1 inch; maximum weight of 165 pounds per cubic feet; include fiberglass fibers in the mix; minimum quanity of 516 cubic yards; maximum quantity of 967 cubic yards.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to 1. Extend the due date of proposals to June 2, 2003 (time and place remaining unchanged); and 2. To provide the following clarification to the BAA:  Per the statement in paragraph 3 of Section 1 of the Proposer Information for BAA 03-22, the Government intends to coordinate the fabrication and radiation testing of the devices designed under this program.  In doing so, the Government intends to pursue the most efficient and cost-effective vehicles to arrange such operations, such as coordination and assembly of multi-project reticles.  While not certain, there is a very high probablity that such operations will be acquired for access by program participants.  However, there is a possibility that such operations cannot be cost-effectively arranged and acquired.  Therefore, as appropriate, offerors may propose to include either or both (fabrication and test) as part of their proposals.  These costs should be included as separately priced options.  Offerors are not compelled to make such fabrication arrangements and no preferences will necessarily be given to those that do so.  Testing is analogous.  The Government intends to see that all testable devices fabricated under this program are unambiguously tested for performance relative to the radiation criteria contained in the BAA.  Offerors may wish to perform or arrange these tests themselves.  If so, then the costs should be included as options.  If minimal or no testing is included in an offer, this should be clearly stated.  Regardless of the eventual organization performing test, any specialized costs associated with rediation testing of the proposed design devices should be included, such as test fixtures, packaging, shipping, etc.

Contract Information: The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer firms for two Multidiscipline Indefinite Delivery Contracts. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Ft. Bra gg Directorate of Public Works for use on federal projects at Ft. Bragg, NC, and Camp Mackall, NC. The contracts will consist of a base ordering period and two option periods, each period not to exceed one year, for a total of three years maximum. An optio n may be exercised before the expiration of the base contract period (or option period) if the contract amount has been exhausted or nearly exhausted. Individual task orders may not exceed $500,000. The total amount of each contract over the three-year ord ering period may not exceed $1,500,000. Task Orders will be primarily for small projects with a construction value typically under $2 million, however if required, larger projects will be executed under this contract. Assignment of individual task orders t o the contracts which will have identical scopes of work will be based upon the following factors:  (1) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, (2) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts, and (3) Pe rformance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC contracts.  These task orders are firm fixed priced. This announcement is open to all businesses. Small businesses are encouraged to team with other small businesses. The firm must be capable of r esponding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below. Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory based on the risk to the government that the o fferor will successfully perform the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Award will be made to the firm determined to be most highly qualified. None of these projects are yet authorized and funds are not pr esently available. The NAICS is 541330; size standard $4 million. This announcement is open to all firms regardless of size. Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum small business goals on the SF 255, Block 6, by identifying subcontracting opportunities with small business. If selected, the large business offeror will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52-219.9 and DFARS 219.704/705 as a part of the  Request for Proposal package. The following subcontracting goals are the minimum acceptable goals to be included in the subcontracting plan. OF THE SUBCONTRACTED WORK, 57.2% TO SMALL BUSINESS; 8.9% TO SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS (A COMPOSITE OF SMALL BUS INESS); 8.1% TO WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS (A COMPOSITE OF SMALL BUSINESS); 3.0% HUBZONE SMALL BUSINESS (A COMPOSITE OF SMALL BUSINESS); 3.0% TO SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (A COMPOSITE OF SMA LL BUSINESS). SEE NOTE 2.The smal1 business subcont racting plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFAR 19.7, Appendix DD. The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. For additional information, please contact Gwen Parker  at (912) 652-5340. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet  site at ht tp://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414. ** NOTES: (1) While the Savannah District does not have a specific target for subcontracting with Veteran Owned small businesses, this must be a ddressed in any subcontracting plan. (2) Service-disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is a composite of Veteran Owned Small Business target. The SD/VOSB target must be included in the Veteran-Owned small business target. **** Project Information: Work may  consist of preparation of reports, studies, project planning, design criteria, cost estimates, specifications, designs, and other general A-E services for multi-disciplined new construction, renovations, and repair projects for military and other governme nt agencies. The work primarily consists of the design of new vertical construction on facilities commonly found at military installations (barracks, dining facilities, offices, training facilities, equipment maintenance facilities, labs, etc.) as well as some smaller horizontal construction projects (airfields, roads, ranges, etc.). The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services that may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, shop drawing review, and commission ing/start-up/fit-up design support. All design CADD files must be delivered in the (*.dgn) format. If the use of scanned files is required, the scanned files must be converted to (*.dgn) format for delivery. All design must comply with the Savannah Distric t Design Manual and the Ft. Bragg Installation Design Guide. ** Selection Criteria: See Note 24 for general selection criteria. Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: **** Significantly More Important - means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor. More Important - means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater. Equal - means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as anot her factor. For this solicitation, Technical Competence, Geographic Proximity, and Knowledge of Locality are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Past Performance, Work Management and Key Personnel and significantly more imp ortant than the other individual factors. Past Performance, Work Management, and Key Personnel are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Small Business Participation and Volume of DoD Contract Awards. Small Business Participa tion and Volume of DoD Contract Awards are weighted equally. ** Each criterion should be submitted FOR THE OFFICE AND/OR EMPLOYEE PERFORMING THE WORK in lieu of other offices/employees for firms in multiple locations. For firms that have offices in multipl e locations, evidence of meeting the criteria should be presented for the office and/or employee that would actually be performing the work in response to this announcement.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for Consolidated Facilities Management (CFM) services to operate and maintain the Archives I facility at Washington, D.C. (D.C.) and the Archives II facility at College Park, Maryland.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  The CFM Contractor must provide all program management, engineering, and services required to operate and maintain both facilities.  The Archives I facility is comprised of the Archives I building at 700 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. in Washington D.C.  The site encompasses an eight-story building, parking area, dry moat, plaza, turf and plant beds, and guardhouse(s) (approximately 1.375 million square feet).  The Archives I building contains approximately 848,635 square feet of occupied area, including offices, records processing offices and storage areas, an exhibition Hall and Gallery, a research complex, media laboratories, an auditorium, conference and training facilities, a fitness center, a snack bar, and a gift shop. The Archives II facility is comprised of the Archives II building (actually composed of ten independent combined buildings numbered 0-9) and site on the northwest corner of the University of Maryland campus at 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland.  The 33 acre site encompasses a seven-story, 1.8 million square foot Archives II building, a cooling tower structure, and guardhouses located at the Adelphi Road entrance and each entrance to the garage. The Archives II building contains approximately 1,374,384 gross square feet of occupiable area, including offices, records processing offices and storage areas; a research complex; extensive conservation and special media laboratories; an auditorium; conference and training facilities; a cafeteria (300 seating capacity); a daycare center; and a physical fitness center; and a four level parking garage with approximately 800 spaces with free parking for employees and the general public.  Parking permits are required and are controlled by Security Contract parking attendants.  These facilities represent a significant investment that must be properly operated and maintained to prevent deterioration of the buildings and the invaluable records stored therein.  For the protection of documents, which are sensitive to chemicals and atmospheric conditions, there are restrictions on the introduction of chemicals, gases, oils, etc.  The buildings contain technology that controls temperature, humidity, and environmental conditions in the records storage (Stack) areas.  The operation of these facilities must be in compliance with strict environmental and atmospheric control standards to minimize potential damage to archival material.  Energy efficiency is an important secondary consideration. The auditoriums, research areas, cafeterias, and other office areas will be open to the public at various times with routine visits by members of Congress, Cabinet level staff, and other dignitaries.  Accordingly, all Contractor personnel must have a security investigation and must abide by strict standards of personal behavior.  Smartness of appearance and cleanliness of the facilities are exceptionally important.  An escort policy for restricted areas is strictly enforced. Normal operating hours are 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays.  Public access hours for specific locations are as follows:

Archives I & II Research Areas
Monday & Wednesday 8:45AM - 5:00PM Excluding Federal holidays

<DESC>Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK): Opportunity for collaborations to implement a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia.  A prospective database of pediatric cases of neonatal cholestasis will also be created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded Biliary Atresia Research Consortium that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large group of patients.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia also pose opportunities for collaborations.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for collaborative arrangements to provide corticosteroids, placebo (for corticosteroids), a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-containing formula to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial of therapy of  biliary atresia.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a collaboration to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia and other forms of neonatal cholestasis. 
	Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks one or more collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology company(ies) to provide corticosteroids, placebo, a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and MCT-containing formula to study important issues regarding possible treatment options and disease progression in biliary atresia.  The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies involving pharmacologic and/or nutritional therapy of newborns and infants.  The statement should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed in biliary atresia, proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels and/or biological effects of corticosteroids, ursodeoxycholic acid and fat soluble vitamins.  In addition, collaborators are being sought for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include: 
1)	The identification of host genetic factors associated with the development of biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis and with the risk of poor outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. This will involve the analysis of genomic DNA from individuals with biliary atresia as well as neonatal cholestasis for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in prioritized candidate genes, which have been identified using a combination of literature search and informatic algorithms including biologic mechanisms, pathogenesis, linkage analysis and biochemical studies.
2)	Development of methods for screening for novel or known infectious etiologies that may be associated with the development of biliary atresia.
3)	Development and/or refinement of new techniques for the diagnosis of biliary atresia and/or the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis.  These might include but are not limited to serum biochemical markers, radiologic/nuclear medicine imaging techniques, and liver histologic/histochemical markers.
4)	Exploration of biochemical and clinical markers to predict outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. 
5)	Development of gene expression arrays that are diagnostic of biliary atresia and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, cholestasis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.
6)	Development of strategies for assessing vaccine response in infants with biliary atresia who receive either corticosteroids or placebo after hepatoportoenterostomy.  This will involve but is not limited to measuring antibody titers to vaccine antigens routinely given during the first six months of life and providing a plan for revaccination if protective levels of antibodies are not found.
7)	Development of a molecular footprint for biliary atresia.  This can be accomplished by two independent methodologies using high throughput profiling. The first will be proteomics of circulating proteins from patients with biliary atresia or diseased-controls (other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of infancy). The second will be expression profiling using high-density gene chips and liver samples from patients with biliary atresia and diseased controls. These complimentary approaches will provide insight into potential diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets for children with biliary atresia.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. 
•	Study Goal:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with biliary atresia using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of biliary atresia and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database of infants with neonatal cholestasis and biliary atresia including clinical information as well as serum and tissue samples.  In addition, the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium will conduct a prospective, randomized, double blind controlled trial of promising therapies for biliary atresia, including use of corticosteroids compared to placebo.    
Applicants for a collaborative arrangement to support this clinical trial must include a description of investigators and staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies to assess patients with biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the pharmacokinetics of the proposed drugs to be used including how and when the drugs should be taken.  The process for biologic sample collection, storage and handling needs must be included.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed to monitor therapy, including assays to determine specific drug levels and/or biological effects along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.
Capability Statements:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages.  Capability statements related to the investigation of corticosteroids, a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat-soluble vitamins and MCT-containing formula in patients with biliary atresia and/or neonatal cholestasis should address the following selection criteria: 
1.	The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease progression in these patients.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the therapeutic agents and nutritional products in a timely manner for the duration of the study. 
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to therapeutic treatment and evaluation of biliary atresia or neonatal cholestasis, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.
4.	The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results and ability to be bound by PHS intellectual property policies if a CRADA is entered (see CRADA:  http://ott.od.nih.gov/newpages/crada.pdf).

DATES:  Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before June 9, 2003, will be considered.   Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement may be invited at the Applicants’ own expense to discuss with the Study Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study’s Steering Committee on date to be determined.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS:  Capability statements should be submitted to Rochelle S. Blaustein, J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 9000 Rockville Pike, MSC 5632, Bethesda, MD  20892-5632, phone: (301) 451-3636, fax: (301) 402-7461, e-mail: rochelleb@intra.niddk.nih.gov

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to add a clause to Section I and respond to technical questions submitted.  The due date for proposals, TUESDAY, MAY 27, 2003, at 3:00 PM Eastern Time, remains unchanged by reason of this amendment.
The following clause is hereby incorporated by reference into SECTION I  CONTRACT CLAUSES:  52.217-4 EVALUATION OF OPTION EXERCISED AT TIME OF CONTRACT AWARD (JUN 1988).  RESPONSES ARE PROVIDED TO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS SUBMITTED:  QUESTION:  This solicitation requires a very tight delivery schedule.  As such, it would be helpful if the government were to provide data files (geometry) at the time of award. The files would be helpful because the information could be downloaded directly to the CNC metal cutting machines.  Without it, the parts would all need to be redrawn.  The prints I see were well done and modern, it looks like they were done by professional engineers and I feel confident you would have good geometry we could use.   RESPONSE:  The Government will not provide data files (geometry) for this requirement.  QUESTION:  I am concerned about the requested melting point of the wax.  The melting point is so low, that it could melt during shipment.  It is not uncommon for temperatures inside the box of a truck to exceed the melting point of the wax.  Further, if the units were to be exposed to solar radiation for extended periods, such as on a flat bed truck, it could melt as well.  I am wondering if a higher melting point wax would be a better choice?  RESPONSE:  The melting point of the wax is derived from an internal specification that optimizes hydrogen content.  If there is a shipping risk, this can be taken into account by proper packaging.  QUESTION:  I notice that the solicitation indicates a period of performance time of 4 weeks after award.  Would you be willing to entertain offers with longer period of performance times?  (8-12 weeks?)  ANSWER:  NIST requires delivery of the shields 4 weeks after the date of award.  ISSUE:  NIST received information from offerors regarding discrepancies in the drawings provided (some missing and some extra).  NIST is currently looking into this issue.  A subsequent amendment will be posted to address the drawings.

STATEMENT OF WORK
IN SUPPORT OF THE 
820th Security Forces Group (820 SFG)

1.0	INTRODUCTION

1.1.  Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain and sustain a service contract in order to maintain and repair our assigned ATVs (48 each) for worldwide deployments and deployment training.

1.2.  Background.  ATV?s are authorized equipment items on all our Unit Type Codes (UTC) supporting three Force Protection Squadrons with a worldwide mobility mission.  In executing the unit mission of providing a secure operating environment at forward airfields, the 820 SFG must deploy operational ATVs to austere locations.  These vehicles are used daily for installation patrols, security missions, supply runs, rations deliveries, ammunitions re-supply, water re-supply, transporting casualties and enemy prisoners, and numerous other functions during a deployment.  In addition, during in-garrison training these assets must be operational for certification training, which is mandated by Federal Statutes.  The serviceability of the assigned ATVs is critical for mission success.         

1.3.  Scope.  This SOW addresses the service provided to the 820 SFG whom ever is selected to support this SOW.

2.3.  Contractor will perform work in a reasonable amount of time.  Although the 820th SFG attempts to keep ATVs in a high state of readiness, said contractor must be prepared to support short notice maintenance requirements.  

2.4.  Contractor shall have the capability to perform general/specialized maintenance on multiple ATV simultaneously.

2.5.  Contractor shall assume responsibility for any loss or damage to ATVs while on contractor premises (this includes loading/unloading of ATVs, fire, theft, dents and cuts).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared per the format in Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number INL 2072-329022 is a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The Government intends to award a firm, fixed price contract to conduct a series of three legal seminars in Kabul, Afghanistan.   

Background:  The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State is providing technical assistance and support to the judicial sector in Afghanistan.  The next formal step in the process of establishing a legitimate, democratic government and the rule of law in Afghanistan, is the ratification of a new constitution, currently scheduled for October 2003.   The constitution will be ratified in a Constitutional Loya Jirga, after a public consultative process.  One critical area within the Constitution is the consideration of individual rights and criminal procedure.  Holding a series of conferences that will bring together the different groups of players within the judicial sector to discuss this issue will complement the consultative process.  Additionally, lack of resources in terms of constitutional and criminal procedure texts continues to be a problem for Afghanistan.  Providing those who will be making these important decisions concerning the Constitution with translated criminal procedure texts as well as copies of compiled Afghan laws will be necessary to move this process forward in the most effective way.

Statement of Work:  The contractor shall provide the following personnel, support and services:

·	Identify and provide two international legal experts to lead discussions at a series of three short conferences held in Kabul, Afghanistan on comparative criminal law.

·	Identify facilities capable of holding discussions comprised of experts and groups from Kabul University Law and Sharia Faculties, Saranwali staff and Supreme Court judges.  

·	Conferences are to be held within the next 60 days and should take place over a time period of one to two weeks.

·	During the conference, distribute a paper-bound book containing Dari translations of several critical comparative criminal procedure texts.  

·	During the conference, distribute Pashtu and Dari translations of Afghan laws to include the Penal Code (1976), Criminal Procedure Law (1965, amended 1975), Civil Law of the Republic of Afghanistan (1973), Legal Procedures of Commercial Courts (1964) and the Bonn Agreement and Constitution of 1964.


Instructions and Evaluation Factors:  Interested offerors should provide a technical proposal indicating their capabilities to provide the services and articles required for the conferences as indicated above.  Offerors will be evaluated on those capabilities as well as their ability to organize and hold the legal seminars within the next 60 days.   This shall be a firm, fixed price effort with travel and per diem reimbursed at the prevailing Government rates and at cost.

The following Provisions and Clauses are incorporated into this RFQ by reference and are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  No addenda apply to these Provisions and Clauses.  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications – Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, FAR 52-212-5, Contract Terms and conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  No additional FAR clauses apply.  

Award will be made based on lowest priced, technically acceptable.  Point of Contact is Mary Pat Hayes-Crow, Contracting Officer, 202-776-8373; email:  Hayes-CrowMP2@state.gov or Timothy E. Henderson, email:  HendersonTE@state.gov.   This RFQ closes at 1600 hours ET, 14 May 2003.

<DESC>Video-on-Demand System The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, University Drive C, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 intends to negotiate with Instant Healthline (IH), 1520 W Altorfer Drive, Peoria, IL 61655, on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, for the purchase and installation of its Video On-Demand System (the system). The IH System will enable on-demand delivery of service to all television outlets located in the 'bedtower' addition at the University Drive facility.  The system has the capacity to store a minimum of 36 hours of digitized video and the ability for an expanded storage capacity. The system has the ability to deliver the video primarily through the existing RF CCTV network. Satellite systems are not acceptable. The system supports a minimum of 8 channels for simultaneous use. It delivers information, using streaming video, through a TCP/IP data network. It has an interface to the existing PBX. The user interface is through CCTV and a telephone (via PBX) to reply to screen prompts. The system has the ability to create reports and output to a fax machine, local printer or electronic storage. The system has the ability to conduct satisfaction surveys and testing using the user interface. The surveys will be developed by the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System and IH, and IH will place onto the system. The results of these surveys and tests are available the same way the reports are available. The system has the ability to print to a TCP/IP network printer, and a network-able laser printer is included. Reports have the option to print automatically or on-demand. Reports contain the following information: what video was viewed, when it was viewed and who viewed it, and any quiz or survey results. The system has the ability to accept analog input and convert it to a digitized file that is accessed from the system. A minimum of 40 educational digitized videos is provided by the IH, with an optional 20 more available based on the VA needs. The videos have unlimited usage without additional charges or usage fees. All video are copyrighted and the VA is given explicit permission to use.  IH will digitize VA owned videos and install them on the system up to the capacity of the system.  60 months of 24/7 Technical Support and Help Desk support is provided, as well as 60 months of maintenance, service and software upgrades. All installation tasks are provided, and installation is a complete turnkey solution. The system has the ability to interface with the VA's local area network (LAN) and IH will provide an interface to the VA's Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS/VISTA) for documentation.  An additional server (Capture Server) will be provided and equipped with Cisco IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) 3.0 Server Software.  This video capture server has 36 video-hour storage capacity.  It is equipped with a Cisco/Optibase MPEG1/MPEG2 capture board and Cisco IPTV Server and Content Manager Software.  The system will allow remote control of scheduled capture of analog video programming received via the VA system satellite equipment at the hospital.  The capture equipment will be connected to the output of the existing VA Knowledge Network satellite downlink receiver at the VA.  The Capture Server will be networked with the on-demand server to permit the transfer of programming from the Capture Server to the on-demand server previously specified.  Programs that have been transferred to the on-demand server have the same capabilities for on-demand access and categorization as the other programs residing on the on-demand server.  Documentation of usage of the transferred programs is consistent with those existing on the on-demand server.  Service, repair, parts warranty and 24-hour help line for the aforementioned Capture Server, software, and related parts will be provided.  Firms who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate system which will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than 4:30pm 6/6/03.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, University Drive C, Pittsburgh PA 15240 ('the VA') intends to negotiate with Media 100, 450 Donald Lynch Blvd., Marlboro, MA 01752 on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, for the purchase and installation of its Media 100 844/XE 10 Bit Uncompressed Digital Compositing and Editing Workstation (the 'unit' or 'workstation').  The Media 100 unit will be purchased to coordinate with the Instant Healthline Video On Demand system (Pittsburgh VA RFI 646-38-03).  The Media 100 Unit is a digital video compositing and editing workstation which has the ability to create 10-bit uncompressed digital video SDI I/O.  The VA will use digital video created by this workstation to create original CCTV programming that is specific to the VA's mission.  This workstation requires AESEBU digital audio, which provides a high quality audio to accompany the high quality video of 10-bit uncompressed digital video.  This workstation also has a breakout box and octopus cable supporting digital video and digital audio I/O and 730 GB 10,000 RPM Dual Ultra 160 Hard drive array for digital storage of programming created, since uncompressed video is so large. Four (4) real-time uncompressed video channels with four (4) real-time full motion Alpha Key channels are provided, essential for speed.  Real-time compositing is accomplished using keys and trasnsfer modes. VTR control is accomplished with the included V-LAN protocol. Character generation is added to programming with the included Inscriber Title Motion software. The file formats supported are Uncompressed, all Quicktime file formats, AIFF, Wave, uLAW, Mace, System7 Sound, OMF, and Photoshop Layer import directly into the timeline with the geometric and blend mode information intact. Other real-time functions include DVE with real-time rotation, scaling, and positioning across all four video/key pairs simultaneously, concurrent real-time color effects on each video and graphics parallel channel, color correction utilizing keyframe controlled RGB color in user defined regions and ranges, chroma and luminance keying with independent keyframing across all layers, and scaling. The time-saving functioning of the unit is imperative to VA needs.  The system is able to have a processing bandwidth of up to 420 MBps. In order to maximize the time of (only one) VA AV Production specialist, VA requires a system that works on four selected video channels in real time, rather than rendering. In this vein VA also requires unlimited video and audio layering, real-time simultaneous keying on all four video channels, real time 50 pixel Gaussian Blur, and video voicing of any four selected video layers in real time.  (The latter is a time saver). The system is able to utilize high-speed recursive processing of the unlimited layers to maintain a fast workflow through transparent management of intermediate files and intelligent allocation of processing routines. VA also requires that the unit be able to export to Adobe After Effects 5.5.  The CPU to host the system is a dual 2.8GHZ Xeon, HP WX8000, 2.5 GB RDRAM, 40GB internal hard drive, 36GB Ultra160 internal SCSI drive for audio, Matrox G550 dual-head graphics, dual Ultra160 SCSI card, color coded keyboard, internal DVD recorder for archiving video, animation and graphics files.  CPU has 3 year on-site parts and labor warranty.  CPU has the new PCIx 100mhz PCI bus architecture.  System requires Executive Software's Diskeeper Workstation 7.0 SE defragmenting software (certified by Microsoft not to cause data corruption).  The maintenance package includes 8x8 toll free telephone support, next day service on workstation, boardset and video storage hard drives, all software upgrades as available, and provides web access to technical forums.  Firms who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate workstation/unit which will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than 4:30pm 6/6/03.  Such notification must include a complete description of proposed equipment, including narrative and specifications, and must demonstrate that it meets or exceeds the capabilities described above.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Modification to Contract with Abt Associates Inc.
<DESC>USAID/Jordan intends to award a sole source modification to Abt Associates under award no.  278-C-00-99-00059-00.  The estimated amount of this modification is approximately $9.75m.

The above contract was awarded to Abt Associates on a Full & Open Competition basis on June 1999 for 5 years at a total amount of $39,752,232.00.  The purpose of this contract is to implement a Primary Health Care Initiatives Project (PHCI) to develop and implement a quality improvement program for primary health care clinics throughout Jordan that includes major improvements in the delivery of reproductive health and family planning services.  The original contract included major renovation and furnishing for 40 clinics, minor renovation for 160 clinics and minor furnishing for 340 clinics.  In addition, the contract included providing highly specialized technical assistance in helping the Ministry of Health (MOH) have sustainable systems for quality assurance training and reproductive health.

During the course of the contract renovation needs exceeded the governments estimate, the MOH requested to expand the medical equipment and furniture package in order to meet the new quality standards that the project is trying to set.  In addition, the sustainability initiatives had to be expanded in order to achieve strong systems in quality, training and reproductive health.  All those needs are an expansion of the scope of work Abt Associates is already implementing. 

The required supplies and services include continuation and expansion of services and supplies of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract.  Seeking new procurement to fulfill those expanded supplies and services will be duplicative, costly, and time consuming as time is of utmost importance as USAID is committed in completing the renovation in 2004 to meet the Government of Jordan’s transformation plan goals of improved Primary Health Care.  This modification is being proposed under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b) (5) for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or unacceptable delays.  Interested companies may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 15 days of publication of this notice.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Point of Contact a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation is available.

<SUBJECT>A -- Multicenter clinical trials: study of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy in hypertensives with Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)
<DESC>Multicenter randomized clinical trials studying the impact of combined angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy on kidney disease progression in hypertensive patients with Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD):

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service of the Department of Health and Human Services seeks collaborations with Industry to provide blinded (ACE inhibitor, ARB, and long-acting metoprololol) and unblinded (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, clonidine, and a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) anti-hypertensive medications to study their impact on kidney disease progression in the setting of PKD.  The study group will perform two prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials of combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.  In one trial, 560 hypertensive patients at an early stage of PKD will be recruited and the trial will compare combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy to beta-blocker, as the primary blinded intervention.  Two different levels of blood pressure control will be studied.  In the second trial, 700 patients with more advanced PKD will be recruited and the trial will compare combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy to ACE inhibitor, as the primary blinded intervention.  Enrollment for both trials will occur at four participating clinical centers.  The trials will have a two-year recruitment phase, and patients will have an average follow-up of four years.  Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK-funded Data Coordinating Center at Washington University, St. Louis, MO.  

Although substantial experimental and clinical data implicate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathogenesis of hypertension in PKD, in the progression of structural changes such as renal cyst growth and renal interstitial fibrosis, and in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, clinical studies to date have not addressed whether complete blockade of the RAAS alters the clinical course of PKD.  This effort therefore represents the first large NIH-sponsored interventional trials of PKD, which will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large cohort of PKD patients, and will determine the impact of intensive blockade of the RAAS and level of blood pressure control in patients with early and more advanced PKD.    

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in the selections.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement may not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria: (1)  willingness and ability to provide blinded and unblinded anti-hypertension medications; (2)  willingness and ability to provide repackaging and distribution of blinded medications;  (3)  timeline for providing medications.

SUBMISSION DATE:  A Collaborator Capability Statement must be submitted by  June 9, 2003.  

CONTACT INFORMATION:  Collaborator Capability Statements should be sent to:  Rochelle S.

Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia also pose opportunities for collaborations.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for collaborative arrangements to provide corticosteroids, placebo (for corticosteroids), a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-containing formula to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial of therapy of  biliary atresia.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a collaboration to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia and other forms of neonatal cholestasis. 
	Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks one or more collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology company(ies) to provide corticosteroids, placebo, a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and MCT-containing formula to study important issues regarding possible treatment options and disease progression in biliary atresia.  The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies involving pharmacologic and/or nutritional therapy of newborns and infants.  The statement should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed in biliary atresia, proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels and/or biological effects of corticosteroids, ursodeoxycholic acid and fat soluble vitamins.  In addition, collaborators are being sought for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include: 
1)	The identification of host genetic factors associated with the development of biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis and with the risk of poor outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. This will involve the analysis of genomic DNA from individuals with biliary atresia as well as neonatal cholestasis for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in prioritized candidate genes, which have been identified using a combination of literature search and informatic algorithms including biologic mechanisms, pathogenesis, linkage analysis and biochemical studies.
2)	Development of methods for screening for novel or known infectious etiologies that may be associated with the development of biliary atresia.
3)	Development and/or refinement of new techniques for the diagnosis of biliary atresia and/or the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis.  These might include but are not limited to serum biochemical markers, radiologic/nuclear medicine imaging techniques, and liver histologic/histochemical markers.
4)	Exploration of biochemical and clinical markers to predict outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. 
5)	Development of gene expression arrays that are diagnostic of biliary atresia and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, cholestasis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.
6)	Development of strategies for assessing vaccine response in infants with biliary atresia who receive either corticosteroids or placebo after hepatoportoenterostomy.  This will involve but is not limited to measuring antibody titers to vaccine antigens routinely given during the first six months of life and providing a plan for revaccination if protective levels of antibodies are not found.
7)	Development of a molecular footprint for biliary atresia.  This can be accomplished by two independent methodologies using high throughput profiling. The first will be proteomics of circulating proteins from patients with biliary atresia or diseased-controls (other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of infancy). The second will be expression profiling using high-density gene chips and liver samples from patients with biliary atresia and diseased controls. These complimentary approaches will provide insight into potential diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets for children with biliary atresia.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. 
•	Study Goal:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with biliary atresia using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of biliary atresia and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database of infants with neonatal cholestasis and biliary atresia including clinical information as well as serum and tissue samples.  In addition, the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium will conduct a prospective, randomized, double blind controlled trial of promising therapies for biliary atresia, including use of corticosteroids compared to placebo.    
Applicants for a collaborative arrangement to support this clinical trial must include a description of investigators and staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies to assess patients with biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the pharmacokinetics of the proposed drugs to be used including how and when the drugs should be taken.  The process for biologic sample collection, storage and handling needs must be included.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed to monitor therapy, including assays to determine specific drug levels and/or biological effects along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.
Capability Statements:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages.  Capability statements related to the investigation of corticosteroids, a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat-soluble vitamins and MCT-containing formula in patients with biliary atresia and/or neonatal cholestasis should address the following selection criteria:

<SUBJECT>--ATC, International Imaging Team to facilitate the Live Fire Demo for High Speed Digital Imaging 2003
<DESC>NA The Aberdeen Test Center, International Imaging Team is proposing to facilitate the Live Fire Demo for High Speed Digital Imaging 2003.  This event is a Ballistic High Speed Imaging System Assessment to be held at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, June 9- 12, 2003, for manufacturer representatives to demonstrate visible high speed imaging systems.  Manufacturer representatives are requested to set-up, operate and record high-speed imagery during a series of daylight ballistic firing missions.  This is an op portunity for industry to display their latest visible spectrum technology and to observe and participate in an actual ballistic range mission. Images collected will be evaluated and used as comparison criteria for selecting imaging systems for future ball istic test applications.  The proposed firing scenario is to fire a large caliber projectile at a steel target. a. Three different fields of view are scheduled to:1) record the projectile in flight prior to impact with the target 2) record the impact and i nteraction with the target 3) record the target and exiting debris field   b. Specific details on the ammunition, trajectory, velocity and distance from target will be provided upon registration.   Each manufacturer representative is limited to 2 visible i maging systems and ancillary equipment to operate, store and playback the images.  Representatives are required to bring all systems and components necessary to record and playback their visible images.  This includes tripods, cables, lenses and media conv erters required for downloading and/or transmitting the image over 500 meters of 50/125 multimode fiber optic cables.

<DESC>NA The Aberdeen Test Center, International Imaging Team is proposing to facilitate the Live Fire Demo for High Speed Digital Imaging 2003.  This event is a Ballistic High Speed Imaging System Assessment to be held at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, June 9- 12, 2003, for manufacturer representatives to demonstrate visible high speed imaging systems.  Manufacturer representatives are requested to set-up, operate and record high-speed imagery during a series of daylight ballistic firing missions.  This is an op portunity for industry to display their latest visible spectrum technology and to observe and participate in an actual ballistic range mission. Images collected will be evaluated and used as comparison criteria for selecting imaging systems for future ball istic test applications.  The proposed firing scenario is to fire a large caliber projectile at a steel target. a. Three different fields of view are scheduled to: 1) record the projectile in flight prior to impact with the target 2) record the impact and interaction with the target 3) record the target and exiting debris field   b. Specific details on the ammunition, trajectory, velocity and distance from target will be provided upon registration.   Each manufacturer representative is limited to 2 visible imaging systems and ancillary equipment to operate, store and playback the images.  Representatives are required to bring all systems and components necessary to record and playback their visible images.  This includes tripods, cables, lenses and media con verters required for downloading and/or transmitting the image over 500 meters of 50/125 multimode fiber optic cables.  ATC shall provide power remote start closure/ 5 volt TTL, 500 meters of 50/125 multimode fiber optic cables terminated with ST connector s and Field Of View details. Aberdeen Test Center and the US Army cannot be held responsible for loss or damage to any equipment or delay or cancellation of the Live Fire Demo for High Speed Digital Imaging 2003.  The range is an active range firing ballis tic projectiles.  Experienced photographers and electronic technicians from Aberdeen will provide guidance on positioning and system protection but cannot be held responsible for events outside their control.  The range is on an active military post that i s subject to multiple levels of security and missions that may influence the scheduled test demonstration.  Camera features that will be evaluated include: a. Ability of record triggered by TTL or dry closure. b. Ability to Remote control and image transfe r over 500 meters of fiber optic cable.  c. Ability to record greater than 512x512 pixel, 24 bit color at a minimum 5000 full fps for 1second internally or greater than 1000x1000 pixel, 24 bit color at a minimum 1000 full fps for 2seconds internally. d.  A bility to remote control through 10/100 Mb Ethernet/RJ45 or Fiber optic connection. e.  Ability to provide anti-bloom response. f.  Ability to provide Global electronic shutter (5 usec minimum). g.  Ability to provide TIFF (24 bit) files and/ or JPG, Quick time or AVI files with option for event metadata to be readable on each frame.  h.  Ability to protect the camera from dust and moisture, ruggedized for field use. i.  Ability to provide sensor sensitivity (minimum 100 ASA).  The anticipated schedule is as  follows: a. June 9 - set-up for manufacturer representatives. b.  June 10 Ã¢Â€Â“ multiple firing missions and data collection. Data collection scenarios will include in-flight, target interaction and behind armor debris.  c.

<DESC>Refurbishment of Pallet Pits



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is F16775-03-Q2181, and this is issued as a Request for Quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) PARTS 12 and 13 and those referenced below. This is unrestricted. Description:   Statement of work for Pallet pits. The contractor shall provide all personnel, tools, materials, management, supervision, and labor necessary to ensure the supply, delivery and installation for the repair of one of the pallet pits in the Air Mobility Command (AMC) Freight Terminal, RAF Mildenhall.  The contractor shall be required to remove the existing pallet pit (lifting tables) Remove existing Lifting-Table Top-Plate Assemblies, remove the Lift- Ram Pistons by cutting away the Pistons and fitting Cover-Plates to close off the existing Rams at pit-base level. Remove existing associated hydraulic tanks / pumps / motors etc., from pit antechambers. Remove existing Weighing Indicator Units from Operator Consoles / Desks. Transport away from site, all of the removed and obsolete equipment. Dispose as applicable. Supply and install new Scissor-Lifting Tables to the following outline-specification: Approx. 3m long x 2.5m wide Tabletop, surfaced with grip-faced tread-plate. Maximum load-capacity of 7,000 kilograms (15,400lbs) The Tables should incorporate four folded-shear-beam load-cells (which are also suitable for the weigh-bridge type activity, of wheeled-vehicles on and off the table). The Indicator Unit is suitable for trade use (Certificate T2532) and the display has 20mm high LED digits indicating least significant digit = 5kilograms (10lbs). The operating temperature range is from –10 to +40C and it are housed in an IP66 rated stainless-steel enclosure. Contractor shall supply, deliver to site, and install welded-construction steel base-frame (with levelling facility), fixed in the bottom of the pit, on which the Scissor Lifting / Weighing Table would be mounted. The top surface of the Table should be flush with the building-floor level when fully raised and at 1.83m (72”) below the building-floor level when fully lowered. Automatically operated shoot-bolts should engage the pit-surround when the table is at building-floor level, thereby eliminating any ‘lowering-creep’ when not being used for prolonged periods. The excessive gaps between the edges of the table and the pit-surround, should be in-filled by rubber buffering to meet health and safety standards. Rotating Beacons and Warning Sirens (operating approximately 10 seconds either side of and throughout the lowering / lifting cycles) should be supplied, fixed to the Operator Consoles / Desks for each Pit-Table position. Safety-switches should be incorporated to prevent lifting or lowering of the table when the pit antechamber door is unlocked. The existing basic structures of the Operator Consoles / Desks could be re-used. All work shall be carried out during the daily hours approximately 08.00 /18.00. Use of government electrical supply and government owned power-tools would be available to the contractor for use onsite. Government owed, government operated Lifting Equipment and Driver would be available to assist in the performance of this work as and when necessary. Personnel requiring entry to RAF Lakenheath/RAF Mildenhall without an escort require written and approved authorization IAW AFI 31-101 and related guidance.
