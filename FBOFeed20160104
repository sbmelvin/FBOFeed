<p>The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research about products which can virtualize the cyberspace aspects of Air Force weapon systems. These virtualized systems would be integrated as modular elements of high-fidelity cyberspace domain models to support realistic mission rehearsals for the warfighter.</p>
<p>The Air Force has routinely used test ranges and a variety of modeling and simulation capabilities to develop, test, evaluate, and provide training for its air and space systems. Increasingly, modeling and simulation capabilities are being used to create ranges which model the cyberspace domain. The Air Force seeks to increase the complexity and fidelity of cyber domain modeling and simulation without the need to install a full set of customized computing, storage and networking hardware for each weapon system that must be represented.</p>

References:
a.  Market Survey Announcement for EPICS, #21803, dated 7/23/15

1.  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Policy Â§ 3.2.1.2.1.  Interested parties are advised that: 
 - This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals;
 - The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals;
 - The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses; and
 - Any costs associated with the response submittals are solely at the interested partiesâ€™ expense.   

2.  Description of the Required Services
The EPICS contract will obtain support services for programs within the FAAâ€™s Communications, Infrastructure and Network Programs (CINP) Group and related programs in accomplishing their mission objectives. The CINP is responsible for the implementation, management, and execution of communications infrastructure programs supporting the National Airspace System (NAS) and non-NAS systems and networks. 
The EPICS contractors will provide a broad range of Program Management support, Acquisition Support, System Engineering including Program Implementation Support, In-Service Management Support, Business and Financial Management support, and other services required by the organization.  

The CINP Enterprise includes NextGen-enabling programsâ€”System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) and the NAS Voice System (NVS)â€”that are fundamental to the NAS. The CINP Enterprise also includes major telecommunications programs such as the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) program and the Alaskan Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure (ASTI) program.  During the EPICS contract period of performance, there will likely be considerable emphasis placed on the implementation of the FTI-2 program that is the follow-on to FTI. The CINP Enterprise also includes the FAAâ€™s portfolio of air/ground communications equipment, legacy voice switches for air traffic control operations, and digital audio recording and distribution capabilities.

In addition to CINP programs, the scope of the EPICS contract includes support for the planning, implementation, and execution of the Data Communications (DataComm) program, other NextGen programs, and other FAA programs that share common mission goals with CINP programs and require the specialized support that will be available through the EPICS contract. 

3.  The FAA intends to use FAA and contractor support staff in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement and will ensure that the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to any review.

4.  The attached draft SIR consists of Sections B through L, including draft Section J attachments.  Interested parties are requested to respond to this announcement by providing comments or suggestions on the attached comment form regarding any of the draft SIR documents.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID, PLANS AND SPECS ARE CURRENTLY&nbsp;NOT AVAILABLE.&nbsp; THE TENTATIVE ADVERTISEMENT DATE IS OCTOBER 8, 2015.&nbsp; THIS PROJECT WILL BE ADVERTISED ON A FULL AND OPEN BASIS.<br /><br />Project Location<br /></strong>Whitney Portal Road, also designated as County Road 4018, is located in Inyo County, and connects the City of Lone Pine to the Mount Whitney and Alabama Hills Recreation Areas. The route begins at the junction with US 395 in the town of Lone Pine, approximately 55 miles south of Bishop, CA and proceeds 11.7 miles to the Whitney Portal access area. The project begins near the western termini or the route, near the recreational parking facilities, continues east for 11.2 miles and end just before the intersection with Tuttle Creek Road (approximately 0.5 miles west of US 395). The route is primarily on federal lands including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Inyo National Forest. The road is maintained by Inyo County. The route is functionally classified as a major collector. All facilities along the route are associated with the use of adjacent lands, and the majority of traffic on Whitney Portal Road is related to recreational use in the forest and on BLM lands.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of the Work</strong><br />The existing Whitney Portal Road within the project corridor is a two-lane, paved roadway with varying widths and variable width unpaved shoulders, as well as multiple paved and unpaved pull-offs and intersecting roadways. The top 3.5 miles of the project are in steep mountainous terrain with very narrow roadway bench width, steep side slopes and switchbacks. The remaining 7.7 miles of the project are in rolling terrain. There are numerous recreational facilities and parking areas adjacent to the roadway throughout the route. The seasonal average daily traffic along portions of the route reaches 1700. There is heavy pedestrian use and parking along the road in the top 2 miles and bicycle use along the entire route.</p>
<p>The proposed road improvements involve pulverizing and paving, minor widening, grading and drainage improvements to 11.2 miles of Whitney Portal Road. Specific project elements, which would generally follow the existing roadway, include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 1, from Mile Post [MP] 0.00 to 3.50: rehabilitation of the existing 22 feet of roadway with the addition of curve widening as feasible. There is a &frac12; mile section of complete reconstruction within Segment 1 due to horizontal alignment shifts.</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 2, from MP 3.50 to 5.2: rehabilitation of the existing 22 feet of roadway.</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 3, from MP 5.2 to 11.2: widen the existing roadway approximately 4 feet to accommodate 11-foot travel lanes, and 3-foot shoulders (28 foot paved width).</p>
<p>&bull; Ditch grading, shoulder reconditioning, embankment reconstruction, pulverizing existing pavement and paving in all 3 segments.</p>
<p>&bull; Slope scaling of existing slopes with unstable rock.</p>
<p>&bull; Rehabilitation of existing pull-outs.</p>
<p>&bull; Replacing the curb, bridge rail and approach rail, and performing minor rehabilitation work (concrete crack repair and erosion mitigation) at an aqueduct crossing. The bridge repairs include the installation of carbon fiber reinforced polymer strips to the top of the bridge deck.</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement of old or damaged drainage culverts and extension of culverts to accommodate the wider roadway.</p>
<p>&bull; Upgrading regulatory/warning signs and guardrails to meet MUTCD guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Items worth noting:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; There is narrow bench width throughout Segment 1 with steep slopes and limited work areas.</p>
<p>&bull; There are steep rock cuts in Segment 1 that require slope scaling in areas with narrow bench widths.</p>
<p>&bull; Large cobbles and/or boulders exist beneath the pavement throughout all 3 segments.</p>
<p>&bull; There is high recreation use, parking adjacent to the roadway, and parking shortages near the Whitney Portal recreation area. Traffic control plans will need to consider methods to prevent parking within active work zones.</p>
<p><br />&bull; There are environmentally sensitive resources adjacent to the road in several locations.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Work along this route will take place within environmentally sensitive areas and will require interactions with the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the County, and the travelling public. Full road closures will only be permitted along portions of the route. In all other locations, delays due to construction will be limited to a maximum of 30 minutes.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Approximate quantities for major work items:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; 60 acres of clearing and grubbing</p>
<p>&bull; 112,000 linear feet of shoulder excavation</p>
<p>&bull; 6,150 cubic yards of waste</p>
<p>&bull; 10 stations of linear grading</p>
<p>&bull; 400 cubic yards of special rock embankment</p>
<p>&bull; 290 stations of pulverizing, 4-inch depth</p>
<p>&bull; 340 stations of pulverizing, 6-inch depth</p>
<p>&bull; 6,250 cubic yards of roadway aggregate</p>
<p>&bull; 33,000 tons of superpave pavement</p>
<p>&bull; 256 linear feet of carbon fiber reinforced polymer</p>
<p>&bull; 24,000 linear feet of asphalt curb</p>
<p>&bull; 3,025 linear feet of guardrail, steel post</p>
<p>&bull; 40 hours of slope scaling</p>

<a href="mailto:krista.weiland@ee.doe.gov">krista.weiland@ee.doe.gov</a>
<DESC>The Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, intends to award a sole source contract, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, to the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS).  Authority to sole source to NIBS is provided for in 12 USC 1701j-2(g)(3).  This contract will be awarded to assist in the development and implementation of a deployment strategy to promote the adoption and use of the National Guidelines for Commercial Advanced Energy Professionals across the public and private sectors.
These guidelines were developed to improve the quality and consistency of commercial building workforce credentials by reducing the uncertainty around workforce credentialing; lower costs; and supporting better credentials, better professionals and better buildings.  The guidelines set an industry-validated Job Task Analysis (JTA) for each job title, as well as certification schemes (blueprints) and learning objectives for training programs.  The guidelines are intended to benefit training and certification programs; employers and building owners/managers; governments and utility programs; and professionals.
In order to develop the guidelines, the Commercial Workforce Credentialing Council (CWCC) was established to lead the development.  The CWCC has completed the JTAs and credentialing scheme and the next phase of the National Guidelines for Commercial Advanced Energy Professionals initiative will be to develop and implement a deployment strategy to promote adoption of the JTAs and credentialing and certificate schemes across the public and private sectors.
In order to develop the deployment strategy, the Department of Energy will acquire contractor services to: ? Operate the CWCC by convening and conducting meetings to advise outreach and certificate development and assisting the CWCC to transition to self-support after FY2016 ? Outreach to Credentialing and Training Programs and Building Owner Organizations ? Maintain and Update the CWCC Website as Needed ? Develop a Building Operator Professional (BOP) and one other technician level certificate program
The estimated duration of the work under this contract is for 9 months, with a program magnitude of between approximately $110,000 and $120,000. 
No RFQ will be issued publically for this requirement.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, no later than January 7, 2016.  However, a determination by the government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Information or questions may be sent via email only to Krista Weiland at krista.weiland@ee.doe.gov.

Currently, NETL uses an IBM Intrusion Detection and Prevention System. This system is configured and tuned for the NETL computing environment. Some components of this system are end-of-life and are not eligible to receive hardware support and/or security software upgrades. This purchase would replace the end-of-life hardware components, extend support and bring our security posture up-to-date. NETL?s current IBM Intrusion Detection and Prevention System requires exact-match IBM brand replacement hardware components to guarantee compatibility with NETL?s existing IBM system. The IBM  maintenance/support items ensure continue use of the hardware components and software support to keep the IBM system operable within NETL?s computing environment. No other brand is fully compatible with NETL?s existing IBM Intrusion Detection and Prevention System.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. To that end NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. Division of Intramural Research (DIR) was established to serve as a hub where development of technology for the rapid isolation and analysis of disease genes will be carried out. The DIR's basic research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to conduct research in medical genetics. Research includes identifying and understanding the molecular basis of human genetic disease and planning and carrying out clinical trials to test methods for the treatment.</p>
<p>The cytogenetic laboratory experience of the trainees must include routine karyotyping from peripheral blood in both children and adults, karyotyping of products of conception, prenatal diagnosis, cancer cytogenetics, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The laboratory aspect of the training program will need to be conducted in cytogenetics diagnostic laboratories with equipment and personnel to provide the hand-on experience required for board certification by ABMG. The staff, which must include both ABMG board certified cytogeneticist(s) and a genetic counselor, will be required to train fellows in applicable laboratory techniques and the clinical interpretation and implications of the test results. The staff must also participate in the comprehensive teaching of fellows including participation in lecture series, journal clubs, and case conferences. A genetic counselor will assist in the training of fellows in the interpretation and genetic implication of tests they are learning to perform in these diagnostic laboratories.</p>
<p>The molecular genetics laboratory experience of the trainees must include a wide array of molecular diagnostic testing in the fields of neurodegenerative disorders, late onset disorders, imprinting disorders, mental retardation, neuromuscular disorders, and metabolic diseases, including prenatal diagnosis. The laboratory aspect of the training program will need to be conducted in molecular diagnostic laboratories with equipment and personnel to provide the hands-on experience required for board certification by ABMG. The staff, which must include ABMG board certified laboratory directors, will be required to train fellows in applicable laboratory techniques and the clinical interpretation and implications of the test results. The staff must also participate in the comprehensive teaching of fellows including participation in lecture series, journal clubs, and case conferences. The cost of disposable supplies used by trainees will be included in the contract.</p>
<p>Quest Laboratories provides training in Cytogenetics and Common Molecular Genetic Diagnostic Testing. This training is a segment of the mandated curriculum of the Washington DC Metropolitan Genetics Fellowship Training Program required for Board certification in Clinical Genetics, Clinical Biochemical Genetics, Clinical Cytogenetics and /or Clinical Molecular Genetics. This training must be provided in CLIA approved, diagnostic laboratories with expertise in this type of laboratory testing. Because most of these tests are diagnostic, for very rare disorders, these are the only labs that meet the American Board of Medical Genetics training criteria within a 40 mile radius of the NIH campus which will allow Fellows to maintain their responsibilities at the NIH Clinical Center and train in these settings.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objective:</span></p>
<p>The mission of the DIR includes the training of physicians and doctoral degree fellows in medical genetics through the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Medical Genetics Residency Program. The Metropolitan Washington D.C. Medical Genetics Residency Program is administered by the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) and is accredited by the American Board of Medical Genetics (ABMG). Requirements for board certification of competency of our trainees include laboratory experiences in cytogenetics, biochemical genetics and molecular genetics. To meet these requirements, the Medical Genetics Branch and OCD seek nearby institutions to provide these components of training for board certification in Clinical Genetics, Clinical Biochemical Genetics, Clinical Molecular Genetics and Clinical Cytogenetics. This institution or group of institutions must also provide the opportunity for trainees to see patients with genetic disorders under the direction of an ABMG board certified geneticist.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Important Considerations</span>:</p>
<p>The Government's minimum requirements are as follows:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific tasks to be performed are:</span></p>
<p>1. Each year the training program will enroll up to four (4) clinical genetics fellows, (2) clinical biochemical genetics fellows, and (3) clinical molecular genetics fellows. Each fellow will spend one (1) month each in the cytogenetics and molecular genetics laboratories.</p>
<p>2. Track the progress of each fellow to insure that they will have had necessary experiences for ABMG certification.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Contractor shall establish and adhere to time lines for:</span></p>
<p>1. Providing all the required experiences for board certification with each month period. <br />2. Evaluating each fellow to insure they have a full understanding of all the techniques taught during training experiences.<br />3. Having sufficient samples submitted to the laboratory so that the fellows can have first-hand involvement in 150 cases of sufficient variety to qualify for ABMG Board eligibility.<br />4. Personnel qualifications are to be provided by the Contractor to the Project Officer for review and approval prior to the award of the contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance:</span></p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Center (SPAWAR) intends to award a sole source follow-on contract to the Questionmark Corporation, a small business, located at 535 Connecticut Ave, Ste. 100, Norwalk, CT 06854. The anticipated contract will be for the procurement of annual software maintenance, consulting, training, and travel for the commercial Perception Learning Assessment System (LAS), to which the Navy and Marine Corp have perpetual enterprise software licenses. Questionmark Corporation, the sole proprietary owner of the Perception LAS, produced and owns the programming code. As such, Questionmark Corporation is the only source which can provide annual software maintenance, minor software modifications and training for the Perception LAS software. Pursuing award through competition would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling critical mission requirements, potentially leading to the non-availability of the LAS. The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and negotiations will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) (1)(b), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The maximum length of the anticipated LAS contract, estimated to be awarded on 20 March 2016, will be five years, comprised of a one-year base with four one-year options. The estimated total dollar value of this contract, inclusive of options, is $1.9M. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a size standard of $38.5M.
This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
Questions concerning this sole source acquisition may be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer, Katherine Holcomb, e-mail address: katherine.holcomb@navy.mil.

<DESC>The proposed IFB procurement is UNRESTRICTED under NAICS code 237110 - Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction. The estimated magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. The work includes civil, structural, mechanical and electrical improvements to the East Shaft Pumping Station to increase its reliability and improve its function. Specific work items include removal of the existing East Shaft pump and installing a replacement submersible pump. Construction of structural floor &amp; wall modifications, replacement of existing electrical transformers &amp; switchgear, SCADA modifications and replacement of traveling screens.
<p>The Washington Aqueduct (WA) provides portable water to approximately one million people in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. The East Shaft Pumping Station is the point of entry for water to the McMillan Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which handles and treats about 40% of the Washington Aqueduct's entire production. The project will provide a comprehensive rehabilitation to the East Shaft Pumping Station. The McMillan WTP is a critical component of the distribution system and so careful consideration has to be given to the phasing of work and critical outages have to be scheduled and met during the low production season. Therefore, an experienced contractor with resources and expertise to handle the following project constraints is needed:</p>
<p>The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) at www.fbo.gov on or about 19 January 2016.</p>

<p>Detailed Specifications are listed in the attachment identified below:</p>
<p>Attachment 1 - Minimum Requirements for a Hydros Water Electrolysis Propulsion System</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide these items to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 334519 (Other measuring Controlling Device Manufacturing) <br />with a size standard of 500 employees. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and indicate socio-economic status (SB, 8(a), SDVO, or HUBZone). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide the required commodities. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. The response must not exceed 15 pages.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: Stephanie.foster@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601HYDROS" If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and to identify interested sources. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. It is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.&nbsp;Unsolicited proposals will not be accepted. Funding is not available at this time. The United States Army has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. Response to this RFI is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this and any follow-on information requests. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responders to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this subject.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information on industry capability to provide Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) and Sustainment and Operations Support of the SHADOW Tactical Unmanned Aircraft (TUAS).

This effort includes contractor managed supply and maintenance, field supply support, depot level supply support, depot-level maintenance, software support, total package fielding, logistics and specialty engineering support, and the integration of Field Service Representative (FSR) personnel for the United States (U.S.) Army and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and Commonwealth of Australia.</p>
<p>The Government does not have a complete procurement Technical Data Package (TDP) for this requirement. However, a level three (production) drawing set, which supports its Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) component, has been procured. The Government is also reviewing Shadow legacy technical data. There are no plans to purchase a complete TDP for this requirement.</p>
<p>Potential responders must be able to maintain interoperability with the UAS Ground Control Stations, OSRVTs, and Army Aviation Platforms.</p>
<p>Additionally, responses may include data that vendors do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for information purposes. If your company wishes to restrict the data, the title page must be marked with the following legend:</p>
<p>Use and Disclosure of Data:<br />This response includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this response. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in these data if they are obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in Data Sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]. Your company may also mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this response."</p>
<p>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:<br />Responders must have a Communications Security (COMSEC) account and must demonstrate the ability to maintain Defense Information Security Program Standards. Security requirements will be Top Secret for the facility and will vary for selected personnel (including Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information, and Communications Security).

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Fort Eustis is conducting market research to ascertain the availability of interested and capable firms to provide exercise support, analysis, and instructional and educational services in support of the Center for Strategic Leadership &amp; Development (CSLD), Carlisle Barracks, PA. The Center for Strategic Leadership &amp; Development's mission supports the Army, combatant commands, and interagency requirements for senior leader education, strategic communication, research and publication. A multi-award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract type is being contemplated. It is anticipated that there will be one (1) base year and four (4) one (1) year option periods.
<p>General tasks within the scope of work may include the following:</p>
<p>Task 1: Exercise Support</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide support to various types of exercises, to include educational instruction, which examines issues and decision making processes at the strategic level, interagency level (including interagency activities), operational level, as defined in Chapter II, paragraph 2, Joint Publication 3-0 (17 September 2006, Incorporating Change 1, 13 February 2008) and for the strategic use of military power in joint and combined operations. These exercises, however, reach down only to and include the level of major operations but exclude issues related to battles; they also exclude issues dealing with the tactical level. The CSLD groups such exercises into four major categories: war-fighting, operations other than war, educational, and senior level decision making. Such exercises are used by CSLD and its customers to support education, training, decision-making, analysis, or planning.</p>
<p>Task 2: Analysis</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct analysis at the strategic and interagency level and for the strategic use of military forces in joint and combined operations for CSLD and its customers. Analysis is defined as examining issues and providing recommendations; examining problems and providing solutions; examining strategic and regional policies and programs; examining decision making processes; researching to gather data and information; researching to identify potential issues; researching to develop educational materials; and modifying or developing methodologies.<br /><br />Task 3: Instructional and Educational Support</p>
<p>The contractor shall design, develop, document, and execute educational courses. These subjects include Joint operations, educational gaming, Army's Title 10 roles, political-military interfaces, all aspects of the Joint phased planning (phases 0-5) and their related sub-activities, theater setting, joint and multinational warfighting, cyber warfare, and worldwide threats. This shall require the contractor to research, create outline curriculum, facilitate and support courses, including planning meetings and workshops. Contractor will utilize standard USAWC, US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), or other Army training and education development and documentation systems, as specified by the customer, for training and educational material development and documentation, as well as submission of course attendee documentation. The contractor shall review and update, as required, all course material prior to commencement of the course and will update and revise all course material after completion of the course and government approval of after-action review/lessons-learned recommendations.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research. The purpose of the sources sought notice is to determine interest and capability of potential qualified vendors relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611710 Educational Support Services.</p>
<p>Interested respondents should submit a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) clearly demonstrating the firm's ability to fulfill the government's requirements. A generic capability statement is not acceptable. Please review the requirements listed below. At a minimum, the package shall address the following:</p>

<DESC>Request for Information<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Topic:</span> Contamination Mapping</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span><br />The Warfighter requires an ability to reduce or eliminate CBRN contamination of equipment including vehicles, aircraft, maritime vessels, fixed sites (e.g. ports, airfields, roads, C2 nodes), and other major end items and supplies with an outcome of mitigating the spread of contamination, minimize exposure, reduce hazardous waste, allow personnel to reduce MOPP levels, and return equipment and fixed sites to operational capability.</p>
<p>An approach for accelerating this process and reducing overall logistical demand for decontamination is to rapidly identify areas of surface contamination (contamination indication) to segregate equipment for processing, focus efforts cleaning efforts on contaminated areas, and assure completeness of contamination (decon assurance).  Previous efforts have developed decon assurance solutions that provide a colorimetric indication of the areas of chemical warfare agent contamination.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability Sought:</span><br />Information is being sought on technologies to automate and accelerate the decon assurance colorimetric indication process and catalog digital location information for later retrieval.</p>
<p>Specifically, respondents shall outline their technology/capability for developing optical systems that automate the contamination indication/ decon assurance processes to:</p>
<p>&bull;	Work in conjunction with a contamination indication/ decon assurance spray to use visible and/or hyperspectral imaging to find contaminated areas on complex 3-dimensional surfaces and digitally map the contamination for later reference and retrieval.</p>
<p>&bull;	Scan an armored vehicle in less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>&bull;	Detect and map all residuals above threshold skin-contact hazards of chemical warfare agents such as HD, GD and VX.</p>
<p>&bull;	Exclude false readings from background and other environmental contaminants.<br /> <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response Instructions:</span><br />Respondents shall address the information described above (and any additional information the respondent shall deem appropriate) via a Capability Statement (five-page limit) in Microsoft Word format.   A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the provided solution also shall be provided.</p>
<p>In addition, respondents shall include their name, address, CAGE code, and DUNS, and submit company size standard under the 541712 NAICS code.</p>
<p>The information shall be submitted via e-mail to charles.a.bass10.civ@mail.mil with a cc: to brian.d.nuckols.civ@mail.mil. Hard copy submissions will not be accepted.  Submissions shall be submitted by no later than 2:00 pm local Ft. Belvoir time on January 20, 2016.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclaimer:</span><br />This Sources Sought notice is solely for the purpose of gathering information and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof. All information received in response to this notice that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:<br /><br />a) Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf.<br /><br />b) Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br /><br />c) JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date.<br /><br />Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br /><br />d) For assistance with the DD2345 or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br /><br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.<br /><br />4.

If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk. Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.<br /><br />a) The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted].<br /><br />b) The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.<br /><br />5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system.<br /><br />Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.<br /><br />Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

When testing for drugs in fatal crashes, there is no delineation between prescriptions drugs and illicit drugs. Testing for drugs in fatal crashes has been has also been limited, however, since 2008; there has been a steady increase in the number of deceased drivers with a drug presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>According to NHTSA research and FARS data, in 2008 41% of all drivers in fatal crashes were tested for the presence of drugs. For those tested, 26% were positive. In 2012, only 40% of all drivers in fatal crashes were tested for the presence of drugs, 32% were positive (NHTSA Berning &amp; Smithers, 2014). Developing training for those who prescribe medications and distribute medications (including prescribed and over the counter medications (OTC)) is an essential resource in reducing and preventing drug influenced serious injury and fatal crashes. </span></p>

While the Secretary of Transportation's emphasis on bicyclists and pedestrians has brought attention to these vulnerable road users, little is known about the effect of bicyclist safe passing laws on bicyclist-motor vehicle interactions and crashes.

If unsafe passing significantly contributes to the number of bicycle/motor vehicle crashes, the second phase of the project will involve enlisting a locality with a large number of these crashes to participate in a HVE program aimed at driver compliance to bicycle safe passing laws. Observations of motorists passing bicyclists will be documented before, during, and after an HVE program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The program will be evaluated to determine the impact law enforcement combined with increased education about bicyclist safe passing laws has on motorists passing bicyclists at a safe distance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The enforcement and education effort would use a modified methodology based on the Gainesville, Florida pedestrian yielding study.

During a typical investigation, a police officer, who has reason to believe that a driver is impaired by alcohol, will administer a series of tests to the driver. These tests serve to confirm the initial suspicion and may provide probable cause to arrest the driver for DWI. The driver's performance on these tests is also a critical part of the evidence presented in court to support the DWI charge. The Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><sup><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><sup><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">[1]</span></sup></span></sup></a>), which is widely used today, was calibrated to assist officers in determining whether the Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2"><sup><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><sup><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">[2]</span></sup></span></sup></a>) of a person stopped for suspicion of DWI is above or below .10 grams per deciliter (g/dL).

While NHTSA has made research contributions throughout the years, including our frequently cited report from the 1998 NCSDR/NHTSA Expert Panel on Driver Fatigue and Sleepiness </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">(NCSDR/NHTSA Expert Panel on Driver Fatigue and Sleepiness, 1998)</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> and our ongoing work on in-vehicle drowsy driving detection, many research gaps still exist that, if closed, would provide substantial progress toward understanding the impact of drowsy driving as well as offering potential solutions to problems it causes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The need for sleep is an inescapable biological phenomenon that when not met leads to widespread and deleterious effects on the mind and body. Whether sleepiness is caused by sleep restriction due to a baby crying all night, a late shift at work, a teenager staying up all night with friends, or due to our natural circadian rhythm, the negative outcomes can be the same. Not surprisingly, the longer someone remains awake, regardless of the reason, negative outcomes become more probable. Sleepiness, without fail, results in cognitive and behavioral decrements that can contribute to diverse negative outcomes including poor school performance, accidents at work, long-term physical and mental health consequences, and, most<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>pertinent to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)-motor vehicle crashes resulting in injuries and death.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The number of drowsy driving crashes per year has remained relatively constant since NHTSA and others started recording and analyzing related crash statistics. Using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and the General Estimates System (GES), NHTSA estimated that between 1989 and 1993 (Knipling &amp; Wang, 1994) there were, on average, 56,000 total crashes (1% of total crashes) and 1,357 (4%) fatal crashes per year that involved a drowsy driver. Using updated data from FARS and GES, NHTSA (NHTSA, 2011) estimated that between 2005 and 2009 there were, on average, 83,000 (1%) crashes and 886 (3%) fatal crashes per year involving a drowsy driver. Due to the subjective nature of the reporting and the reliance on crash investigators who often have to make their best guess<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>of cause in crashes where no survivors remain, FARS data for drowsy driving crashes and fatalities is likely conservative.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In the United States a number of surveys have asked drivers if they have fallen asleep while driving before. One study found that 41% of drivers report having fallen asleep at the wheel at some point since beginning to drive, 4% fell asleep during the previous month, 7% during the past six months, and 11% during the past year (Tefft, 2010). A NHTSA study (Royal, Street, &amp; Suite, 2002) using a nationally representative telephone survey of 4,010 drivers also found similar results, 37% of drivers reported ever falling asleep at the wheel and 8% fell asleep in the previous six months. Most recently the CDC (Wheaton, Chapman, Presley-Cantrell, &amp; Croft, 2013) performed a telephone survey of 147,076 drivers across 20 U.S. States. They found that 4% of respondents reported falling asleep in the past 30 days while driving.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Drowsy drivers come from every race and ethnicity, gender, age, income level, education, and employment status. Some groups are more frequent drowsy drivers than others. Men report falling asleep while driving in the preceding 30 days more frequently than women (5.3% vs. 3.2%), 25 to 34 year olds are the most likely to report falling asleep while driving (6.3%), as are people with less than a high school diploma or GED (4.8%), black (6.1%) and Hispanic (5.9%) drivers are more likely than white (3.2%) drivers to report falling asleep during driving, and employed (5.1%) and unable to work (6.1%) drivers were more likely than unemployed (3.1%) or retired drivers (1.0%)(Wheaton et al., 2013).</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Recently, one study explored how college students' self-reported attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control was able to predict study participants' willingness and intention to engage in drowsy driving (Lee, Geiger-Brown, &amp; Beck, 2015). Unfortunately not much is known beyond this about the public's knowledge and attitudes that lead to drowsy driving. Understanding the public's attitudes and knowledge is an important step in building predictive models of behavior that will allow NHTSA to design and deploy countermeasures that will impact the incidence of drowsy driving across the United States.</span></p>

The Contractor shall conduct a survey of randomly-selected drivers ages 18 years or older. Drivers in this context are individuals with or without a driver's license, permit or endorsement who operate a motor vehicle. NHTSA aims to collect 7,000 completed surveys; however, Offerors can recommend a different number of surveys in their proposals based on a power-analysis or other appropriate justifications.

However, deteriorating response rates in telephone surveys and evolving technology require moving away from telephone surveys. NHTSA intends to conduct the survey in an approach that emphasizes Web-based administration but includes a printed-on-paper mode through the U.S. mail. The methodology shall follow address-based sampling, U.S. mail contact, and random selection of a single respondent within households.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In 2001, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sponsored the creation of the National EMS Research Agenda; this document, among other important topics, advised the EMS community to apply evidence from scientific research to improve pre-hospital patient care. In 2006 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) furthered this recommendation by also advocating for evidence based guidelines (EBGs) in its report on the Future of Emergency Care in the United States. These documents led to recent efforts to create a nationally accepted evidence-based guideline model process that will allow Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Systems to provide scientifically validated, and more effective, pre-hospital care to the American public. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">NHTSA and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) recently sponsored the development of a number of EBGs focusing on topics such as pain management, trauma care, air medical transportation of trauma patients, pediatric seizure management, and pediatric respiratory distress. In addition to sponsoring the creation of EBGs, NHTSA is exploring the implementation of EBGs at the State level through a cooperative agreement awarded to the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) in 2012. As more EBGs are created and are adopted by States and EMS systems, it is critical that a method for tracking their implementation and effectiveness is conceived.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The first step in tracking the implementation and effectiveness of EBGs is to assess the utility of currently available medical data from EMS information systems, States, and the Federal Government. Most States are now participating in the National EMS Information System, commonly known as NEMSIS, which provides the framework for collecting, storing and sharing standardized EMS patient care data. Participating States collect and transmit a subset of their data to the National EMS Database, where it is available for EMS stakeholders, researchers and public use. In addition, data not available to the national system may be available in individual State's individual EMS databases allowing for additional tracking and analysis not available on the Federal database.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The existence of these sources of data provides a potential mechanism to track, assess, and understand the impact of pre-hospital EBGs on patient care outcomes from motor vehicle crashes and other health emergencies. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the appropriate data exist, or are in the appropriate format for scientific assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of new EBGs. The current proposed project seeks to:, 1) create performance measures to assess the implementation and effectiveness of the EBGs over time, 2) determine whether the appropriate data exist in national and State databases to monitor and assess EBG implementation, 2) provide suggestions to State and national database managers that will assist them in modifying databases to improve EBG tracking, 3) Create performance measures for EMS agencies/systems to evaluate their implementation of EBG's, and 4) if appropriate data exists to track the implementation and effectiveness of EBGs, analyze the currently available data to show the beginning stages of EBG implementation.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The results of the current research project will help improve pre-hospital emergency medical care for persons injured in motor vehicle crashes or who have other emergency health conditions, by helping Federal and State EMS stakeholders determine not only the rate of adoption and effectiveness of new EBGs, but it will also help them identify geographic areas where the adoption of EBGs could have the largest impact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing data acquisition electronics for a scintillator based neutron proportional counter.<br /><br />The Research Facility Operations group at the NIST Center for Neutron Research has been engaged in a large development project to develop an ultrathin neutron detector as part of a larger project to develop and energy-analyzing neutron detector. <br />The ultrathin sensor uses 6LiF:ZnS(Ag) plastic scintillator as the neutron converter. Scintillation light could be conducted out of the scattering plane into photosensors using wavelength shifting fiber optics. The photosensors selected for this application are silicon photomultipliers. These photosensors are inexpensive, use low bias voltages (&lt; 100V), and are insensitive to the magnetic fields which are expected to be used by many sample environments on this spectrometer.<br /><br />The signal processing for this type of neutron detector is rather more sophisticated than that used for the more traditional gas-filled proportional counters. The burst of scintillation light produced by a gamma ray capture event can be equally as intense as that for the neutron capture event, but is much shorter lived (&lt; 200 ns). .<br /><br />For this reason, the technique of Pulse Shape Analysis must be used to discriminate neutron capture events from gamma rays or other extraneous sources. To that end, the most flexible way of performing this signal processing is to digitize the amplified signal from the photosensor and to use programmable logic (e.g., FPGA) to apply the algorithm to the digitized waveforms. Alternatively it is possible to use discrete components of fixed values to approximate the pulse shape analysis algorithm.<br /><br />NIST is seeking contractor capabilities and pricing for these two general forms of solution to this requirement: one involving digitization and real time processing of analog signals from the photosensor and the other using a discrete component front end to discriminate the analog signal and a logic backend to read out those events. <br /><br />NIST is particularly interested in solutions which have a following characteristics:<br /><br />&bull; Readout<br />o Uses open communication standards (Ethernet &amp; TCP/IP)<br />o Scalable to 1620+ channels<br />o Capable of assigning unique identifier (or "Pixel ID") to each channel<br /><br />&bull; Timestamping<br />o The system must be able to associate a timestamp with each neutron event (absolute or relative to a provided reference signal)<br />o Time resolution is minimally 1 microsecond (&lt;50 ns preferred)<br />o Dynamic range of timestamping is 60 s or greater<br />o Preference is given to a solution that can produce absolute timestamps according to the IEEE 1588 (Precision Time Protocol) standard<br /><br />&bull; Throughput<br />o The system must be able to handle 10,000 events per second per channel without any perceptible downtime<br />o The system must be able to handle a total of 8 million events per second over the entire collection of channels<br /><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the instrumentation that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.</p>
<p>Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture these instrumentations are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Lynda.Roark@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(s) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to Lynda.Roark@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide these items to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>

The government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made.

<p>&bull; Mission Command - Research, develop and engineer advanced computing platforms, software architectures and visualization systems<br /><br />&bull; Tactical and Deployed Power - Advance the generation, storage, management and distribution of Soldier and mobile power and energy as required for training, moving and sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations</p>
<p>&bull; Tactical Cyberspace Operations - Provide capabilities that protect the network and enable capabilities that deny or manipulate information and infrastructure for intelligence protection, collection and other efforts</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic Warfare - Extend capabilities to dynamically sense, protect and control the electromagnetic spectrum and deny its use by adversaries</p>
<p>&bull; Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting - Provide advanced collection capabilities that adapt to changes in the operational environment and strategically narrow precision and focus based on signatures of interest<br /><br />&bull; Intelligence Analysis, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination - Enable systematic processes to discover, select, organize, distill, share, develop and use information to provide a holistic understanding of the enemy and the enemy's environment while conducting full-spectrum operations</p>
<p>&bull; Countermine/Counter-IED - Provide dismounted forces and ground and air platforms with the ability to detect, identify and mitigate IEDs, landmines, minefields and other explosive hazards and obstacles</p>
<p>&bull; Tactical and Strategic Networks - Enable networks and networking technologies that transport, secure, manage, filter, and analyze data from numerous Army, Joint and Coalition intelligence and information sources</p>
<p>INTENTION:</p>
<p>In order to exploit industry creativity and innovation, the Army must work more closely with industry in the earliest stages of the product lifecycle, before requirements are firm and before design concepts are determined. The sooner industry learns of the Army's interest in a new capability, the sooner industry can begin to explore or invest in applicable technologies and formulate ideas for Army consideration. The intent of the sessions will be to enhance Government-and-industry communication and enable industry to quickly respond to emerging requirements with innovative technology solutions and partnerships. This event will serve as the kick-off meeting, designed to:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist industry in identifying and aligning efforts with CERDEC's Mission Areas<br />&bull; Articulate high-level capabilities and their derived technical requirements <br />&bull; Present technology roadmaps and CERDEC's strategies to fulfill these needs</p>
<p>FINAL NOTES:</p>
<p>Information presented during the event is for planning purposes, does not represent a pre-solicitation synopsis, does not constitute an invitation for bid or request for proposal, and is not a commitment by the government to purchase the desired products and services.</p>
<p>The event is currently planned to be held at the Unclassified - For Official Use Only level. Further distribution statements may apply but final determination has not been made at this time.</p>
<p>Registration is anticipated to open 1 February and close 28 February. Due to the high-level of interest in this event, registration is will be limited. It is anticipated the limit will be set to no more than three (3) at this time. While priority registration will be given to industry, the forum is also open to academia and other government organizations.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army holds the right to cancel and/or change session event times, dates and locations under certain conditions. These conditions usually include, but are not limited to: inclement weather, event venue cancellation or rescheduling, speaker cancellation or rescheduling, and insufficient number of participants for the event. The U.S. Army holds the right to cancel the event for any reason up to and including the day of the event. In the event that the U.S .Army must cancel the event, the U.S. Army will not be responsible for costs incurred in preparation. In the event of predicted inclement weather, a decision will be made by 5pm on the prior day. If the event is cancelled, the notice will be posted on this website and an email will be sent to all registered participants.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		8530-01-490-7372<br />Name:		Kit, Toiletries<br />Description:	Toiletries kit includes personal sizes of basic items. Kit contains shampoo/body wash (2 oz.), conditioner (2 oz.), hand/body lotion (2 oz.), fluoride toothpaste (0.85 oz.), wrapped toothbrush (1), shaving cream (0.85 oz.), twin-edge plastic razor (1), and a plastic comb. Packed in a plastic bag. UOI is BX. BX = 12 individual kits.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8530-01-490-7372<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	COP4907372 / 490-7372;</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than January 21, 2016 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
<p>Neurally Inspired Computing Principles</p>
<p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking information on neurally-inspired computing principles.  This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information gathering purposes; the RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals.  IARPA anticipates that responses to this RFI will be used to help organize a workshop on this topic at the 2016 Neuro Inspired Computational Elements conference (http://niceworkshop.org/) and to inform future programs in this technical area.  The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND SCOPE<br />Seventy years ago, John von Neumann found inspiration for the design of the EDVAC in what was then known about the design of the brain.  However, despite the early influence of neuroscience on what has become known as the von Neumann architecture, the principles of computing underlying today's state of the art digital systems deviate substantially from the principles that govern computing in the brain.  In particular, whereas mainstream computers rely on synchronous operations, high precision, and clear physical and conceptual separations between storage, data, and logic; the brain relies on asynchronous messaging, low precision storage that is co-localized with processing, and dynamic memory structures that change on both short and long time scales.  To understand the potential opportunities and challenges in developing next-generation computers that exploit these and other principles of neural computing, IARPA is seeking information from two groups of experts: (1) computer scientists with experience in designing or building computing systems that rely on the same or similar principles as those employed by the brain; and (2) neuroscientists who have credible ideas for how neural computing principles can offer practical benefits for next-generation computers.<br />Responses to this RFI should clearly and concisely answer the questions posed below (to neuroscientists, computer scientists, or both) in one or more of the following topics:</p>
<p>Topic 1: Spike-based representations:</p>
<p>Brains operate using spike-based codes that often appear sparse in time and across populations of neurons. In many systems, these codes appear noisy or imprecise, suggesting a plausible role for approximate computation in brain function.</p>
<p>For neuroscientists:<br />&bull;	What practical benefits could our current understanding of the brain's use of spike-based representations, sparse coding, and/or approximate computation offer for next-generation computers?  What gaps in understanding or challenges must first be overcome?<br />&bull;	Have there been simulations or demonstrations of how spike-based representations, sparse coding, and/or approximate computation can be used to perform real-world tasks?</p>
<p>For computer scientists:<br />&bull;	What is the current state of research in the use of spike-based representations, sparse coding, and/or approximate computations for digital or analog computing systems?  <br />&bull;	Are there existing hardware systems that utilize representations similar to spikes? If so, in which application areas and use cases have these been deployed, and what are their performance characteristics?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Topic 2: Asynchronous computation:</p>
<p>Brains do not employ a global clock signal to synchronously update all computing elements at once. Instead, neurons function independently by default, and only transiently coordinate their activity (e.g. when participating in a coherent cell assembly).</p>
<p>For neuroscientists:<br />&bull;	What practical benefits could our current understanding of the brain's use of asynchronous computation and/or transient coordination offer for next-generation computers? What gaps in understanding or challenges must first be overcome?<br />&bull;	Have there been simulations or demonstrations of how asynchronous computation and/or transient coordination can be used to perform real-world tasks?</p>
<p>For computer scientists:<br />&bull;	What is the current state of research in the use of asynchronous computation and/or transient coordination for digital or analog computing systems?  <br />&bull;	Are there existing hardware systems that utilize asynchronous computation and/or transient coordination? If so, in which application areas and use cases have these been deployed, and what are their performance characteristics?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Topic 3: Learning:</p>
<p>Brains employ plasticity mechanisms that operate continuously and over multiple time scales to support online learning. Remarkably, brains continue to operate stably during ongoing plasticity.</p>
<p>For neuroscientists:<br />&bull;	What practical benefits could our current understanding of the brain's use of online learning over short and long time scales offer for next-generation computers? What gaps in understanding or challenges must first be overcome?<br />&bull;	Have there been simulations or demonstrations of how online learning over short and long time scales can be used to perform real-world tasks?</p>
<p>For computer scientists:<br />&bull;	What is the current state of research in the use of online learning over short and long time scales for digital or analog systems?  <br />&bull;	Are there existing hardware systems that utilize online learning over short and long time scales? If so, in which application areas and use cases have these been deployed, and what are their performance characteristics?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Topic 4: Co-local memory storage and computation:</p>
<p>Brains do not strictly segregate memory and computing elements, as in the traditional von Neumann architecture. Rather, the synaptic inputs to a neuron can serve the dual role of storing memories and supporting computation.</p>
<p>For neuroscientists:<br />&bull;	What practical benefits could our current understanding of the brain's use of co-local memory storage and computation offer for next-generation computers? What gaps in understanding or challenges must first be overcome?<br />&bull;	Have there been simulations or demonstrations of how co-local memory storage and computation can be used to perform real-world tasks?</p>
<p>For computer scientists:<br />&bull;	What is the current state of research in the use of co-local memory storage and computation for digital or analog computing systems?  <br />&bull;	Are there existing hardware systems that utilize co-local memory storage and computation? If so, in which application areas and use cases have these been deployed, and what are their performance characteristics?</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>This notice is being published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.201 and 5.204 requiring notice of a proposed contract action.</p>
<p>This posting is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Award is subject to Sole Source Justification approval.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to issue a purchase order to Life Technologies, 5791 Van Allen Way, Carlsbad, California, 92008-7321pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)----Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. This requirement will provide a service maintenance agreement for a one year for the EVOS system. The anticipated performance period will be from January 19, 2016 - January 18, 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Immunity, Inflammation, and Disease (DIID), utilizes the EVOS system in imaging to investigate the autophagy and LAP pathways in the control of inflammation. This equipment is necessary to provide my lab with tools for analysis of the inflammatory process and immune response.<br />The DIID had a one year warranty with Life Technologies that expires on December 31, 2015. This 1-year service contract shall ensure efficient long-term operation of our instrument and uninterrupted service coverage. Life Technologies is the sole source for the licensed selling, maintenance and care of their inverted microscope system.</p>
<p>AMG (Advanced Microscopy Group), (Life Technologies is now part of ThermoFisher Scientific and is the sole manufacturer of the EVOS&reg; Digital Inverted Imaging System (including the AMAFD-1000 series, AMEX-1XXX series, AME-33XX-XX series, AMF-43XX-XX series and AMEFC-43XX-XX series) - a fully self-contained inverted microscope system. No other vendor manufactures these items and ThermoFisher Scientific is the only company that can service and support the EVOS line of Microscopes.<br />The lenses, light cubes, and culture dish brackets in the attached quote are of proprietary design, specifically manufactured to work with the EVOS line of inverted fluorescent microscopes. As such, no other company is able to offer the modifications to our apparatus.</p>
<p>This seamless pipeline is necessary to ensure extensive research which relative to how our innate immunity patrols the body searching for environmental cues that are potential danger signals, such as irradiation, chemical exposure, or pathogens. The ability of the innate immune system to resolve these stresses relies in part on engagement of the autophagy machinery. Our ability to study these proteins and their actions in the resolution of these danger signals is critical to understanding the mechanisms by which we handle environmental danger in terms of wound healing, inflammation, and immunity. This mechanism is vital to the mission of the NIEHS.<br />This service contract serves to maintain current working status, on-site visits for repair when necessary and software upgrades as needed. Failure to purchase this service agreement will mean that upgrades will not be performed and that service visits will need to be paid upon request, costing thousands of dollars for each visit. This service contract will enable the equipment to operate at optimal levels and generate data comparable to what has been historically produced. <br />This service maintenance agreement at the NIEHS from January 19, 2016 - January 18, 2017 in support of the Department of Immunity, Inflammation and Disease and this anticipated action will provide a seamless and fluid transition in terms of maintenance for this critical equipment.<br />This contract action is anticipated in FY 2016.<br />This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government may consider responses received within fifteen calendar(15) days of this posting.<br />A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capacity to fulfill this requirement. NIEHS will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice.<br />Contracting Office Address: <br />PO Box 12874<br />Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709 <br />Place of Performance: <br />National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) -- Building 101</p>

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for a one year service and maintenance contract for a Bruker D8 Discover Diffractometer and a Bruker D8 Advance. This service and maintenance is available through the manufacturer, Bruker AXS Inc. of Madison, WI. The NAICS code is 811219 with a size standard of $20,500,000.00.</p>
<p>The proposed purchase order is being solicited on a sole-source basis to Bruker AXS Inc.

The basis for restricting competition is for the following reasons: Bruker AXS Inc. is the manufacturer and they have the proprietary data rights to this software and hardware. The NSWCCD intends to award a firm fixed-price purchase order to Bruker AXS Inc. using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest to this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement no later than 19 January 2016.

(See 452.237-74 KEY PERSONNEL (FEB 1988.) Missing, incomplete, or ambiguous information could result in a rating of "unacceptable".</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance</strong><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quoters must provide Past Performance references for at least three (3) projects for work performed by the Quoter within the last three years</span></strong>. Include the project title, description, dollar value, dates performed, location, and contact information (name, title, phone, and email address). Missing, incomplete, or ambiguous information could result in a rating of "unacceptable".</p>
<p>The Government may contact any or all of the past performance references provided by the Offeror in response to this solicitation, and may also use information obtained from any other sources when evaluating past performance. The past performance factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. Past performance will be rated "unacceptable" if the contractor receives an unsatisfactory rating from references unless the offeror can demonstrate that adequate corrective actions were taken. In the case of an Offeror with no relevant performance history, or for whom no information on past performance is available, the Offeror will be evaluated as "acceptable" provided the Offeror certifies that additional past performance information is not available and provides an acceptable explanation as to why past performance information is not available.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK 		

System Description 

The Q800R1 Sonicator is a specialized sonicator designed specifically to shear DNA and chromatin. This equipment is modular to enable customization to suit specific research needs. This instrument set up includes a temperature monitoring system and generator to provide optimal conditions for DNA and chromatin shearing among a variety of samples. This equipment is necessary for generating specific size ranges of DNA to then prepare the samples for Next Gen Sequencing. The specialized nature of this particular piece of equipment is essential for our research requiring a specific size of DNA for mechanism and targeting. The sophisticated technology offered by this instrumentation is not currently available to our laboratory at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center Research Service. 
Clinical Utility 
The Q800R1 Sonicator is a specialized sonicating machine that is not currently available for use by our laboratory. This product will be used for animal research and will not be used on human subjects. This instrument is a complex, highly specialized technology that is essential for DNA and chromatin shearing. To our knowledge, there is no currently similar instrumentation that allows for DNA to be sheared to specific size ranges. The sonicator includes a chiller that is able to control temperature during the shearing protocol. It also includes a digital operating system with programmable memory, a high intensity ultrasonic horn, and a sound reducing enclosure. The Q800R1 incorporates sample rotation to ensure even sonication and reproducible results. Also, the system is designed to be compact and modular to maximize space and customizability. The modular nature of the The Q800R1 Sonicator allows for the system to be customized meeting both current and future needs without unnecessary additional equipment. Additionally, the sonicator comes with sample protocols for mammalian, yeast, and C. elegans chromatin to further optimize results from this specific machine. In the past, we had access to a Q800R1 sonicator else where we have used it to generate data for my VA MERIT supported research. We have published 1 manuscript (Inhibition of class I histone deacetylase activity represses matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 expression and preserves LV function postmyocardial infarction. Mani SK et al. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol, 2015. 308(11): H1391-401) and 2 other manuscripts under review. Unfortunately, we no longer have access to the sonicator. Therefore, for research continuity, we need to purchase the exact same model Q800R1 sonicator for the continuation of our research. 

 The vendor must be able to supply instrumentation to meet the following specifications: 
1.	A specialized DNA/chromatin shearing sonicator designed specifically for multiple size ranges. 
2. Real-time data to view parameters on screen and in graph 
3. Digital operating system with programmable memory for multiple protocols 
4. Upgradable, modular system that can be customized and expanded to meet specific needs over time 
5. The ability to view history 
6. A high intensity ultrasonic horn 
7. A sound reducing enclosure

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Ankle Supports. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Ankle Supports products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil">https://www.medical.dla.mil</a>. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Ankle Supports in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885. <br /><br />The QSL for Ankle Supports will be established approximately June 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately July 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Ankle Supports. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Ankle Supports. <br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Ankle Supports. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,129,818.60. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Twenty-seven items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 48.5% ($548,090.22) of the total volume in sales ($1,129,818.60). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below. <br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. <br /></strong><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor offered products should be TAA compliant. End-items offered shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample. <br /><br /><strong>Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong><br />1.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />28<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-<br />(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or<br />(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (May 2013)<br />As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions.

(D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.<br />"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:<br />Solicitation:<br />30<br />ITEM NO.<br />SUPPLIES/SERVICE<br />QUANTITY<br />UNIT<br />UNIT PRICE<br />AMOUNT<br />0001<br />Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse<br />20<br />EA<br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:<br />ITEM NO.<br />SUPPLIES/SERVICE<br />QUANTITY<br />UNIT<br />UNIT PRICE<br />AMOUNT<br />0001<br />Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse<br />20<br />EA<br />0002<br />Monitor<br />20<br />EA<br />(End of provision)<br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)<br />(a) Definition.

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes &amp; Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure blood sample analysis services. Specifically, the NIDDK would like blood samples obtained from its Mechanisms of Microbial Translocation in Hepatitis C related liver disease study analyzed for metabolomics and other phenotyping and clinical assessments for HVC patients to have a more comprehensive understanding of disease progression and treatment response in a cohort of control subjects (mild disease) and patients with advanced disease.</p>
<p>Project Background:<br />The NIDDK is conducting the Mechanisms of Microbial Translocation in Hepatitis C related liver disease study. The overall focus is on the connections between the innate immune system and liver-related damage and repair. The clinical focus is on noncirrhotic portal hypertension, which is when a person's blood pressure rises above normal levels in the hepatic circulation of the liver for other reasons than the liver disease called cirrhosis. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease, sickle cell disease, Turner syndrome, sporadic nodular regenerative hyperplasia, hepatitis D, acute hepatitis C, and congenital hepatic fibrosis are also examined.</p>
<p>The study cohort of 30 patients has both portal blood and peripheral blood samples (EDTA plasma) collected at a single time point, and also stool, liver biopsies and other samples for secondary analysis. A comparison between portal and peripheral blood is sought in the first instance, totaling 60 samples for each assay. About two thirds of the study samples have been collected to date and collection is expected to be completed by February 2016.</p>
<p>As a part of data analysis, the Government prefers the following services:</p>
<p>&bull; Data spreadsheet, per sample including relative quantitation<br />&bull; Detected biochemicals grouped by pathway and super pathway<br />&bull; Statistical results for each group, including p value and q value, as appropriate<br />&bull; Written summary of 5 pages or less outlining biochemical differences<br />&bull; Adding special interest biochemicals to platform library for positive identification</p>

This meter functions as a compound pressure gage, simultaneously measuring the high side and low side gage pressures along with the differential pressure, and displays each of the readings in sequence. Any reading may be alternately displayed in English or metric units and may be directly converted to other units immediately following display of the reading. Any mix of readings or units can be stored for later recall.<br />EXTREMELY SENSITIVE OVER BROAD RANGE<br />The HydroData Multimeter is accurate across an extremely broad range of fluid gage pressures and differential pressures. The high pressures existing at pumps, chillers, cooling towers, and high rise building conditions can be measured up to 250 psi. The meter will also measure very low pressures, such as reheat coil pressure drops, and low flow conditions on flow measuring orifice plates, or pitot probes down to 0.1 in wc differential and gage pressures. Additional low<br />pressure applications include negative pump suction head and air side pressures of fans, coils and filters.<br />DESIGNED WITH CONVENIENCE IN MIND<br />The HydroData Multimeter comes complete with a shutoff, bypass, and blow down valve network mounted on a portable meter panel. The valve network panel facilitates meter zero procedure, bleed-off of air, venting of pressures, or draining of water. The valves are quarter turn, brass body, stainless steel ball, teflon seat design.<br />The HydroData Multimeter may also be removed from the valve network panel and used independently.<br />The rugged carrying case is designed with storage compartments for accessories, hoses, tools and reports or paperwork. The meter and valve network panel are easily removed from the carrying case and conveniently carried to various project locations.<br />S HYDRODATA<sup>TM</sup> MULTIMETER HDM-250<br />i ELECTRONIC PRESSURE GAGE<br />AUTOMATIC RANGE AND MANUAL ZERO<br />This meter automatically selects the proper range and compensates for internal temperature. A combination valve setting and keypad sequence is used to zero the meter, providing unusually accurate low gage and differential pressure readings down to 0.1 in wc.<br />MEMORY STORAGE AND RECALL<br />The memory function of the meter will store up to 100 sets of pressures and/or temperatures with selectively variable units. All readings are tagged and recalled in sequential order. Memory is particularly useful for comparing previous set points to final conditions during the hydronic balancing process.<br />SLOW READING MODE<br />The slow mode averages multiple measurements over a four to eight second sample time to improve repeat- ability and reading accuracy of fluctuating pressures.<br />AUTOMATIC READINGS<br />The auto-read setting allows continuous automatic readings for monitoring ongoing changes in a system as it is being adjusted. This function can be used with the memory mode for later recall and analysis.<br />TEMPERATURE READINGS<br />This meter is ideally suited for temperature efficiency testing of boilers, chillers, cooling towers, coils, and all types of heat transfer and energy recovery systems. The 1/8" or 1/16" diameter, stainless steel TemProbe is uniquely suited for measuring air wet bulb, dry bulb, and water line temperatures. The optional AirData MultiTemp may be used with the HydroData Multimeter to measure temperatures at eight remote locations in<br />very rapid sequence.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in, writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. <br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] <br />(5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-<br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or<br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause.<br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-<br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or<br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.<br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.<br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.<br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.<br />(e) Definitions.

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. <br />(3) Ceiling price.

The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check.

The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

Disposal of all hazardous wastes shall be performed by the Contractor and the Contractor shall meet all federal and state requirements. The Contractor is also required to submit an acceptable hazardous waste management plan to the Port Engineer at the Arrival Conference. The plan will be reviewed by the facility hazardous waste manager. An acceptable plan must address, at a minimum, the following requirements:<br />(a) EPA and local authority hazardous waste generator ID numbers or registration of the Contractors, his transporters, and disposal facilities (TSDFs);<br />(b) An inventory of all hazardous chemicals, compounds and other agents brought aboard the facility accompanied by their respective Material Safety Data Sheets;<br />(c) A list of all anticipated hazardous wastes to be generated and a federal/state/local regulation cross reference list for those wastes;<br />(d) Waste collection and containment procedures;<br />(e) A hazardous material spill and cleanup plan including tools and materials that will be on hand and readily available to facility containment and cleanup;<br />(f) Training certification for the Contractor's hazardous waste manager.<br />(8) VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: <br />1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.</p>

<p>(11) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any Quotation submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the Quotation includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the Quotation.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor and shall be included in the Composite Labor Rate. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(12) DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT<br />Work requests can be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how work requests are to be followed during an availability:</p>

<p>(13) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); <br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br /><br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling<br />Housekeeping Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration Security Testing<br />(8) all consumables;</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(14) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the Contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the Contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the Contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The Contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the Contractor at time of award. The Contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all Government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The Contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(15) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>(16) CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>
<p>(a) The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistic Center (SFLC) will monitor and evaluate the successful offeror's past performance of this contract and prepare a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) in accordance with FAR Part 42.15.

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation is the lowest price technically acceptable quotation. Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. The Government will evaluate "Key Personnel" and "Past Performance" to determine if a quote is considered technically acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Key Personnel</strong><br />Key personnel are defined as the quoter's proposed employees responsible for providing regular ASL Interpreting Services. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quoters shall submit a one-page resume for all individuals proposed as key personnel.</span></strong> Interpreters shall have a minimum of three years continuous experience in performing similar interpreting services in a diverse office environment.</p>
<p>The Key Personnel factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. In order to receive an "acceptable" rating, Quoters must demonstrate that all key personnel proposed have sufficient relevant experience to indicate they have the knowledge and capability to successfully perform their assigned roles. If proposed key personnel are replaced during the execution of this project, replacement personnel must have equal or better qualifications as those proposed and must be approved by the Contracting Officer before they perform work. (See 452.237-74 KEY PERSONNEL (FEB 1988.) Missing, incomplete, or ambiguous information could result in a rating of "unacceptable".</p>

Past performance will be rated "unacceptable" if the contractor receives an unsatisfactory rating from references unless the offeror can demonstrate that adequate corrective actions were taken. In the case of an Offeror with no relevant performance history, or for whom no information on past performance is available, the Offeror will be evaluated as "acceptable" provided the Offeror certifies that additional past performance information is not available and provides an acceptable explanation as to why past performance information is not available.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(viii) <strong>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items</strong>, applies.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation is the lowest price technically acceptable quotation. Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. The Government will evaluate "Key Personnel" and "Past Performance" to determine if a quote is considered technically acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Key Personnel</strong><br />Key personnel are defined as the quoter's proposed employees responsible for providing regular ASL Interpreting Services. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quoters shall submit a one-page resume for all individuals proposed as key personnel.</span></strong> Interpreters shall have a minimum of three years continuous experience in performing similar interpreting services in a diverse office environment.</p>
<p>The Key Personnel factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. In order to receive an "acceptable" rating, Quoters must demonstrate that all key personnel proposed have sufficient relevant experience to indicate they have the knowledge and capability to successfully perform their assigned roles. If proposed key personnel are replaced during the execution of this project, replacement personnel must have equal or better qualifications as those proposed and must be approved by the Contracting Officer before they perform work. (See 452.237-74 KEY PERSONNEL (FEB 1988.) Missing, incomplete, or ambiguous information could result in a rating of "unacceptable".</p>

The past performance factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. Past performance will be rated "unacceptable" if the contractor receives an unsatisfactory rating from references unless the offeror can demonstrate that adequate corrective actions were taken. In the case of an Offeror with no relevant performance history, or for whom no information on past performance is available, the Offeror will be evaluated as "acceptable" provided the Offeror certifies that additional past performance information is not available and provides an acceptable explanation as to why past performance information is not available.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<DESC>1. The purpose of this amendment is to:<br />a. clarify the following questions:<br />i. Will the Government provide any proposal template, example or format?<br />1. Instruction for proposal content and format are included throughout Section B, Section C,<br />Section H, Section I and Section L of the Solicitation.<br />ii. How is this solicitation being evaluated? Will it be based on the total contract value (summation of<br />all the CLINs)?<br />1. Proposal evaluation factor are included throughout Section M of the solicitation.<br />iii. Can the Government extend the Solicitation due date, because I am awaiting SAR approval?<br />1. As indicated on the Pre-Solicitation "Award of this requirement will not be withheld<br />pending SARs approvals.<br />iv. Will the Government accept proposal from non-approve sources or sources waiting SAR approvals?<br />1. Interested parties can submit proposal prior to or at the proposal due date, but they<br />cannot be evaluate or consider it for award unless and until they become an approved source at any time<br />before award.<br />v. Why is "Overhaul/Repair" mentioned repeatedly throughout this solicitation? Does this imply that we<br />have control on whether a valve gets overhauled or repaired and if so, what constitutes a repair versus an<br />overhaul?<br />1. Overhaul refers to the valve as an assembly and the repair refers to the repairable subassemblies<br />or piece parts. All valves get overhauled. The repair of specific sub-assemblies or piece<br />parts have specific repair criteria in accordance with the DMWR. If these parts exceed repair limits they<br />must get replaced. Again all valves get overhauled.<br />2. The Government will extend the due date from 04 January 2016 to 18 January 2016 to give all<br />interested parties time modified their proposal base on the clarification of this question.<br />b. Amend SECTION B - SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS NARRATIVE B0001 to include Overhaul Support Services<br />LLC (CAGE Code 52VE4) as an approved source for NSN: 2995-01-313-0691 P/N: 4046T28G15 and NSN: 2995-01-294-9867 P/N:<br />4046T28G14.

<DESC>Purpose of Amendment:  The purpose of this Amendment 0005 is to provide a revised Performance Work Statement, Beal Irrigation Table, a copy of the Sign in Sheet for the site visit and provide the questions and answers submitted in response to this solicitation.

Receipt of Offers:  The date for receipt of offers/quotes remains Thursday, January 7, 2016, at 2:00 p.m., local time.  Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to dlrodriguez@usbr.gov.  The subject line should reference the solicitation number.  

Acknowledgement:  See block 11 of the SF 30 of this amendment regarding how to acknowledge this amendment.  The acknowledgement must be received at the designated email address stated above.

Offer/Bid Modification:  See block 11 of the SF 30 of this amendment if you have submitted your offer/bid and now desire to modify it or withdraw it.

A.  As a result of the above, this amendment revises the following and provides the appropriate revised pages:

1.  Performance Work Statement, Page 2, months of irrigation is being corrected to read "March through September" instead of "March and September."

2.  Performance Work Statement, Page 3, requirement to fertilize is being removed.  Checking berms and roads for blow outs is being updated to be performed daily while on site irrigating.  

3.  Performance Work Statement, Page 3, Paragraph titled Manual Removal of Vegetation is being updated to include removal of other "nonnative" vegetation.  Also being updated is the contractor shall keep the roadways, walkways, irrigation valves and rock struction clear of "at least 90% of all" vegetation "per week" for safety purposes.

4.  Performance Work Statement, Page 5, Performance Requirements Summary is being updated to remove the requirement to fertilize from Task 1 and update the performance standard for Task 4 to include the requirement to remove at least 90% of vegetation along roadways, walkways and around the irrigation valves. 

B.  The following responses are provided to questions submitted in response to this solicitation:

1.  Can more than on alfalfa valve be open for irrigating cells allowing two or cells to be irrigated at one time?

Answer: If the question is Â¿Can more than one alfalfa vale be opened for irrigating cells allowing two or more cells to be irrigated at one time?Â¿, then the answer is no.  Each cell should be irrigated individually, one cell at a time.  The irrigated cell, berms and pump shall be monitored during the irrigation cycle and the irrigation time recorded.

2.  With the number of cells and required no of flood events in four days assumptions have to made to cover all required work. One cell, EE, is "as needed". Is the goal to keep this cell at a specific moisture/wetness? In the past, generally speaking, how often was this cell irrigated (?) or please provide a schedule so I can ensure we get it covered. 

Answer: See updated cell irrigation schedule.  Note MM and II are now listed as once a month, and EE is listed as once a week.  Irrigation schedules for each cell can be adjusted per the decision of the Project Manager throughout the season.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>Background and Description: <br />The DSO, which is a part of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), is a recognized center of excellence for DoD spectrum matters. One of DSO's missions is to provide spectrum and Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) engineering and analysis support services on a reimbursable, customer-funded basis to DoD Components, federal agencies, non-federal government organizations, and to foreign entities when authorized by the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), or the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. <br />Engineering support related to spectrum operations are an integral part of the overall information battlespace. In future operational environments it is essential that electromagnetic systems perform as expected to help achieve mission objectives. The challenges faced in meeting our objectives include:
<p>&bull; Rapidly changing technologies associated with spectrum systems<br />&bull; Competing demands for spectrum access<br />&bull; Adversaries utilizing advanced technologies<br />&bull; Coordinating and collaborating with all pertinent stakeholders (e.g., services, intelligence community, commercial, academia)<br />&bull; Providing timely and accurate information for decision makers at the appropriate level<br />&bull; Working efficiently across multiple mission areas and organizations</p>
<p>A thorough understanding of the physics and technologies related to spectrum-dependent systems and how tactical operations are affected, is essential in supporting this effort. This would include:</p>
<p>&bull; Spectrum related technologies (e.g., electromagnetic propagation, non-linear effects, antennas, near field conditions, Electromagnetic Pulse, etc.) across the electromagnetic spectrum<br />&bull; System performance considerations (e.g., digital signal processing, Software Defined Radios, encryption technologies, system vulnerabilities, etc.)<br />&bull; Software tools (e.g., engineering, scenario) applications and limitations<br />&bull; Testing and measurement tools and processes and limitations<br />&bull; The integrated operational, technical, and policy (e.g., regulations generated by the World Radiocommunications Conference) aspects of the EMS Applied Engineering Support tasking</p>
<p>To achieve the objectives of this PWS, it is imperative that the contractor takes an integrated approach, considering the DSO and its customer base and technical, operational, policy, and acquisition factors, and working with close communications with all stakeholders to ensure requirements and expectations are met. This includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Promoting and leveraging a multi-disciplinary, highly-skilled workforce with technical, analytic, and operational expertise<br />&bull; Encouraging collaboration to strengthen partnerships across diverse domains<br />&bull; Aligning business processes, management practices, and tools to best serve the broader community<br />&bull; Applying consistent and repeatable quality management practices (e.g., ISO 9001) to ensure that requested products and services are value-added and delivered within cost and schedule. Management of elements include:<br />&bull; Planning<br />&bull; Execution<br />&bull; Communications <br />&bull; Monitoring (e.g., periodic reviews, testing)<br />&bull; Adjustments<br />&bull; Delivery and acceptance criteria<br />This contract will provide technical support to DSO for the following tasks:</p>
<p>a. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and E3 Analyses EMC and E3 Analyses in support of DoD Components, Federal Agencies, and FMS countries to ensure that spectrum-dependent (S-D) systems being developed or fielded are spectrum supportable in their intended training, test, and operational environments.</p>
<p>b. Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessments (SSRAs). SSRAs in accordance with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 4650, the Joint Services Guide, and service specific regulations. <br /><br />c. Equipment Spectrum Certification (ESC) and Supportability. ESC in support of DoD Components to ensure that S-D systems being developed will able to obtain the spectrum necessary to accomplish their mission both nationally, as well as host nation (HN) coordination internationally.</p>
<p>d. Spectrum Measurement Support. Measurement support to DoD Components, Federal Agencies, and FMS countries to ensure that S-D systems can operate compatible with intended operational and test environments.</p>
<p>e. Protection of International Usage of the Spectrum. Support for program developers of S-D systems that are intended for worldwide deployment by monitoring spectrum allocation changes that are being proposed at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).</p>
<p>Contract Type: The Government contemplates award of a single-award indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed-price, cost plus fixed-fee, and cost type CLINs contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Competition: This solicitation is a full-and-open competition.</p>
<p>The requisite NAICS code for the acquisition is 541330.</p>
<p>Questions &amp; Comments: The RFP HC1047-15-R-4012 is attached. Proposals must be received no later than January 11, 2015 at 5:00PM Eastern. Industry's questions and/or comments related to this solicitation will be posted to the Government Point of Entry (Fedbizopps.gov) as an amendment.

<DESC>UPDATED 4 January 2016: Due to technical difficulties, any emails sent to <a href="mailto:usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.list.uas@mail.mil">usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.list.uas@mail.mil</a> were not received by the Government.<br /><br />The email issue has been corrected. PLEASE RESEND any communications that were sent to this email.<br /><br /><br />DESCRIPTION:
<p>Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC-ORL) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) in support of United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) requirements. This acquisition will be referred to as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). NOTE: This SSN was associated with Special Notice and Request for Information (RFI) listed under solicitation number W900KKHTASC. UAS requirements will be supported by a separate contract vehicle now associated with this SSN's solicitation number W900KK-16-R-0024.</p>
<p>Potential North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for UAS: 611512 Flight Training.</p>
<p>The Government has provided a DRAFT UAS Performance Work Statement (PWS, Attachment 01 to this SSN).</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information regarding relevant experience and capabilities of industry partners interested in performing this potential requirement. Responses to this SSN will be used to gain insight from industry's experience performing similar requirements and to analyze the information in order to develop a contract vehicle capable of supporting the described mission. Based on this assessment, the Government will finalize an acquisition strategy and generate a formal draft solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc.</p>
<p>The Government also encourages industry to provide questions, comments, and suggestions relating to the PWS provided. Questions received will be consolidated, answered and, if deemed valuable information for all interested parties, will be posted at a later date on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. The Government will not disclose the identity of the potential offeror asking the questions.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>USAACE's training requirements were previously supported by Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) through the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract and the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract. USAACE's Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) requirements will be supported by the new UAS solicitation number W900KK-16-R-0024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Please submit all responses (and any other written correspondence) to the following email inbox (the size limitation is 20MB) with email Subject: "UAS Sources Sought Notice Response". <br /><br />usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.list.uas@mail.mil</p>
<p>Responses are DUE: Wednesday, 17 FEBRUARY 2016, 12:00 PM EST.</p>
<p>Government Points of Contact: <br /><br />Susan Halvatzis Contract Specialist, ACC-Orlando, 407-208-3378<br />&nbsp;<br />Jennifer Kimzey Contracting Officer, ACC-Orlando, 407-208-3297<br /><br />JD Summers UAS Requirements Lead, USAACE, 334-255-2143</p>
<p>NOTE: Responses are due after the Government's USAICoE Industry Day (planned for 26-27 January 2016). Additional information regarding USAICoE Industry Day is provided in the "USAICoE Industry Day" section below.</p>
<p>Please mark submitted proprietary information/data accordingly.</p>
<p>Cover page shall include:</p>
<p>Contractor name, address, point of contact information, DUNS, CAGE, and small business information, if applicable (including reference to above listed NAICS).</p>
<p>Responses shall be:</p>
<p>- 20 pages or less (not including cover page);<br />- Arial, font size 12, (graphics can utilize smaller/different font);<br />- 1 inch margins; and<br />- organized into three distinct sections:</p>
<p>Section I. Describe your firm's applicable capabilities related to the enclosed PWS and related past performance (to include contract name/number, customer name/contract information, period of performance, and a brief description of the related services). Past performance should be recent (meaning contract is ongoing, or, if the contract has ended, the contract end date shall be no more than three years prior to this SSN posting date). Firms can provide verbatim language from the HTASC RFI #1 (W900KKHTASC) submission as needed.</p>
<p>Section II. The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc. Describe your firm's perspective on effective strategies for satisfying this requirement, focusing on real-world and/or conceptual solutions and relevant lessons learned that address the Government's UAS requirements. Please provide any realized or theoretical earned value (e.g. cost, schedule, performance) that may be derived from the strategy/strategies. Describe the basis behind the recommendation and the expected outcomes. Outcomes should be rationalized and articulated in terms of the costs and benefits to the Government.</p>
<p>Section III. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is it your firm's intention to support UAS as a prime contractor? If so, which requirements/tasks would your firm intend on supporting through subcontracts (if your firm is identified as a small business under one of the identified NAICS, please consider FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting)?</p>
<p>2. What would your firm consider an appropriate length of time for transition from the incumbent contract to the UAS contract?</p>
<p>3. In general, are there specific portions of the Government's DRAFT requirements documentation that your firm feels need to be defined more clearly?</p>
<p>4. Do you feel the requirements are defined enough to allow for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract, or, some FFP line items for specific tasks?</p>
<p>5. Relating to the instructor qualifications, will your firm be able to provide fully trained employees by the period of performance start date as required by the attached DRAFT PWS? If not, how do you intend to meet the requirements? What limitations does your firm have? If you feel that your firm requires external and/or Government provided training to meet the requirements, how does your firm intend to retain your workforce/knowledge base to continue meeting the requirements of this effort?</p>

AMENDMENT A003: Issued January 4, 2016 to replace Attachment 9 with Attachment 9R to correct the due date for receipt of Past Performance Questionnaires.

AMENDMENT A002: Issued December 23, 2015 to extend date for questions to January 6, 2016 and due date for proposals to January 21, 2016.

AMENDMENT A001: Issued December 11, 2015 to add Contract Line Items for data requirements.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of replacement driver amplifier substrate assemblies and output amplifier substrate assemblies; both subassemblies are used inside the primary power amplifier for the Mode Select Beacon System (Mode S). The Mode S Beacon System is a combined secondary surveillance radar (beacon) and ground-air-ground data link system.  Mode S provides positional information and minimizes interference.  Mode S provides the medium for a digital data link which can be used to exchange information between aircraft and various air traffic control functions and weather databases.

The primary power amplifier produces high power radio frequency (RF) pulses that are radiated in space through the antenna main directional beam (frequency of operation is 1030 MHz).  The Government requires form-fit-functional replacement subassemblies that contain modern and available RF components; e.g., the RF transistor(s); that can replace the legacy units. 

Westinghouse; now Northrop Grumman originally designed, developed, and manufactured the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly, which were procured by the FAA when the Mode S systems were initially fielded.  The available specifications or drawings are provided with this market survey. The subassemblies must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the Statement of Work.  

The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract, with a first article delivery of two (2) units of each subassembly and options to buy 50 production units of each subassembly. 
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-16-R-05357 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  The SIR includes a technical evaluation to allow the FAA to determine Best Value.  Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Surveys to customers/contractors who are familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables of the prime/general contractor demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature  [Provision L.3(g)(2).]  Offerors will complete Page 1 and Page 2, Section A of the Past Performance Surveys and then provide the surveys to their customers, who will in turn complete and return the surveys directly to the Contracting Officer by the due date specified on the surveys.  Two (2) to five (5) Past Performance Surveys must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.  Surveys received after the established due date may not be evaluated.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among Small Businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 750 employees.

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROJECT/SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING (CONNIE.M.HOUPT@FAA.GOV) NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CST ON JANUARY 6, 2016, TO ALLOW FOR RESPONSES TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID, PLANS AND SPECS ARE CURRENTLY&nbsp;NOT AVAILABLE.&nbsp; THE TENTATIVE ADVERTISEMENT DATE IS OCTOBER 15, 2015.&nbsp; THIS PROJECT WILL BE ADVERTISED ON A FULL AND OPEN BASIS.<br /><br />Project Location<br /></strong>Whitney Portal Road, also designated as County Road 4018, is located in Inyo County, and connects the City of Lone Pine to the Mount Whitney and Alabama Hills Recreation Areas. The route begins at the junction with US 395 in the town of Lone Pine, approximately 55 miles south of Bishop, CA and proceeds 11.7 miles to the Whitney Portal access area. The project begins near the western termini or the route, near the recreational parking facilities, continues east for 11.2 miles and end just before the intersection with Tuttle Creek Road (approximately 0.5 miles west of US 395). The route is primarily on federal lands including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Inyo National Forest. The road is maintained by Inyo County. The route is functionally classified as a major collector. All facilities along the route are associated with the use of adjacent lands, and the majority of traffic on Whitney Portal Road is related to recreational use in the forest and on BLM lands.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of the Work</strong><br />The existing Whitney Portal Road within the project corridor is a two-lane, paved roadway with varying widths and variable width unpaved shoulders, as well as multiple paved and unpaved pull-offs and intersecting roadways. The top 3.5 miles of the project are in steep mountainous terrain with very narrow roadway bench width, steep side slopes and switchbacks. The remaining 7.7 miles of the project are in rolling terrain. There are numerous recreational facilities and parking areas adjacent to the roadway throughout the route. The seasonal average daily traffic along portions of the route reaches 1700. There is heavy pedestrian use and parking along the road in the top 2 miles and bicycle use along the entire route.</p>
<p>The proposed road improvements involve pulverizing and paving, minor widening, grading and drainage improvements to 11.2 miles of Whitney Portal Road. Specific project elements, which would generally follow the existing roadway, include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 1, from Mile Post [MP] 0.00 to 3.50: rehabilitation of the existing 22 feet of roadway with the addition of curve widening as feasible. There is a &frac12; mile section of complete reconstruction within Segment 1 due to horizontal alignment shifts.</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 2, from MP 3.50 to 5.2: rehabilitation of the existing 22 feet of roadway.</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 3, from MP 5.2 to 11.2: widen the existing roadway approximately 4 feet to accommodate 11-foot travel lanes, and 3-foot shoulders (28 foot paved width).</p>
<p>&bull; Ditch grading, shoulder reconditioning, embankment reconstruction, pulverizing existing pavement and paving in all 3 segments.</p>
<p>&bull; Slope scaling of existing slopes with unstable rock.</p>
<p>&bull; Rehabilitation of existing pull-outs.</p>
<p>&bull; Replacing the curb, bridge rail and approach rail, and performing minor rehabilitation work (concrete crack repair and erosion mitigation) at an aqueduct crossing. The bridge repairs include the installation of carbon fiber reinforced polymer strips to the top of the bridge deck.</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement of old or damaged drainage culverts and extension of culverts to accommodate the wider roadway.</p>
<p>&bull; Upgrading regulatory/warning signs and guardrails to meet MUTCD guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Items worth noting:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; There is narrow bench width throughout Segment 1 with steep slopes and limited work areas.</p>
<p>&bull; There are steep rock cuts in Segment 1 that require slope scaling in areas with narrow bench widths.</p>
<p>&bull; Large cobbles and/or boulders exist beneath the pavement throughout all 3 segments.</p>
<p>&bull; There is high recreation use, parking adjacent to the roadway, and parking shortages near the Whitney Portal recreation area. Traffic control plans will need to consider methods to prevent parking within active work zones.</p>
<p><br />&bull; There are environmentally sensitive resources adjacent to the road in several locations.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Work along this route will take place within environmentally sensitive areas and will require interactions with the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the County, and the travelling public. Full road closures will only be permitted along portions of the route. In all other locations, delays due to construction will be limited to a maximum of 30 minutes.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Approximate quantities for major work items:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; 60 acres of clearing and grubbing</p>
<p>&bull; 112,000 linear feet of shoulder excavation</p>
<p>&bull; 6,150 cubic yards of waste</p>
<p>&bull; 10 stations of linear grading</p>
<p>&bull; 400 cubic yards of special rock embankment</p>
<p>&bull; 290 stations of pulverizing, 4-inch depth</p>
<p>&bull; 340 stations of pulverizing, 6-inch depth</p>
<p>&bull; 6,250 cubic yards of roadway aggregate</p>
<p>&bull; 33,000 tons of superpave pavement</p>
<p>&bull; 256 linear feet of carbon fiber reinforced polymer</p>
<p>&bull; 24,000 linear feet of asphalt curb</p>
<p>&bull; 3,025 linear feet of guardrail, steel post</p>
<p>&bull; 40 hours of slope scaling<br /><br />Contracting Range = $10 - $15 million</p>

<p>Solicitation Number: D14PC00002</p>
<p>Synopsis - D14PC00002, Noncompetitive Contract Action to increase BIO Assistance Contract Ceiling<br /><br />The Department of the Interior (DOI), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), intends to issue a sole source modification action to increase the ID/IQ contract ceiling from $95M to $125M to the incumbent, by other than full and open competition, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by DOI. Responses may be submitted until January 3, 2016 to Corletta Campbell, Contract Specialist, at corletta_campbell@ibc.doi.gov or Jarreau Vieira, Contract Specialist, at jarreau_vieira@ibc.doi.gov.</p>
<p>The purpose of the contract is to provide administrative and technical support services the Business Integration Office (BIO) requires in order to fulfill its need for Financial and Business Management System (FBMS) Production support and development, technical support of the FBMS environments, project management, and managing and providing assistance to other systems closely aligned with FBMS.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide critical support services required by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Business Integration Office (BIO), to accomplish its mission. These services shall also be provided to other parts of DOI for BIO related activities. The mission of the BIO is to perform Financial and Business Management System (FBMS) operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) including Tier 2 Help Desk support and managing software upgrades; manage overall system security; perform Business Intelligence reporting development and support; manage and deliver training in support of process standardization; optimize the FBMS solution, including mobile and light applications (where effective) and in support of legislative and regulatory compliance; lead application leverage efforts, based on the direction of FBMS governance; and take a leadership position in the U.S. Federal workspace for FBMS software products such as SAP ECC, SAP BusinessObjects, and PRISM.</p>
<p>FBMS is the cornerstone of a fully integrated business management system, supporting DOI as a world-class organization acknowledged for management excellence and effective mission delivery. It is critical to the DOI's financial management modernization strategy and to meeting future business needs. FBMS is a functionality driven SAP and Compusearch solution designed to incorporate the majority of DOI's financial management functions into one system. FBMS uses many modules of SAP. DOI strived for the least amount of customization and promotes business process standardization across bureaus. Still, all system implementations require some amount of configuration and customization. This integrated system will ultimately eliminate over 80 DOI and bureau-specific systems and enable the alignment of a business management system with the DOI's strategy of modernization, integration, accountability, and customer value. The full implementation of FBMS allows the DOI to realize the benefits of common processes, a common technology platform, integrated real time data, and improved operational decision making. FBMS achieved the initial goal of having all of DOI on one system with Deployment 8 (D8) go-live in November, 2013. For an introduction to FBMS, please see http://www.doi.gov/fbms.</p>
<p>The Business Integration Office (BIO) is the successor to the FBMS Program Management Office (PMO). The PMO was assigned with developing and deploying FBMS to all of DOI. D8 completes this original assignment. The scope of the BIO is larger than simply supporting FBMS. The primary difference between FBMS PMO scope and BIO scope is that the BIO is not constrained to FBMS support alone, but is tasked with supporting the full functional scope under the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Finance, Performance and Acquisition (DAS-BFPA). This may include managing or providing assistance to other systems closely aligned with FBMS such as Concur Government Edition (CGE) travel or supporting Roadmap efforts resulting in projects or new systems.</p>
<p>The BIO directs the work of a variety of Government and contracted resources in order to achieve program objectives. The BIO consists of several workstream teams all of which contain an integrated mixture of Federal and contractor resources. These teams have worked closely with the System Integrator (SI) to identify scope, develop custom objects, and deploy FBMS to all of the bureaus in the DOI.</p>
<p>The FBMS deployments have followed a cyclical development process with each deployment increasing functional scope while transitioning additional bureaus into FBMS. Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) support to the deployed bureaus is being provided simultaneously with ongoing development. O&amp;M support will continue through 2030. The BIO will continue to ensure FBMS is up to date and meeting DOI needs. The BIO will also continue to optimize this initial investment in FBMS and leverage this investment as appropriate with expanded functionality.</p>
<p>In summary, the purpose of this acquisition is to acquire services to support the BIO Federal staff. The contractor shall perform duties related to FBMS Production support and development, technical support of the FBMS environments, project management, and managing or providing assistance to other systems closely aligned with FBMS. <br />The scope of BIO work consists of three primary types of work: FBMS Production Support and Development; Technical Support; and Project Management Support. The scope of this contract is to support all three of these types of work. The bureaus and offices, as users of FBMS and other BIO services, have similar support needs. The intent of this contract is to provide a vehicle for bureaus and offices to issue task orders for similar support. The Government recognizes that the most efficient solution to this type of support may include resources being shared across task orders.</p>
<p>Following the deployment of FBMS, the Business Integration Office (BIO) has been focusing on a number of critical activities to sustain the solution and leverage the efficiencies of an enterprise-wide business management tool and organization to support business management integration. These activities include:</p>
<p>Operations of the BIO to support the operations, maintenance and enhancement of FBMS, as well as closely related business integration and roadmap activities;<br />Analysis and implementation of system improvements needed to comply with critical business management reporting requirements and directives;<br />Implementing required and user-driven functional improvements to strengthen internal controls; <br />Completing migration to a larger, secure, modernized cloud hosting technical infrastructure;<br />Leveraging the FBMS investment and the BIO to support modular opportunities to increase management efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and accountability; and<br />Implementing an in-memory database to optimize real-time analytics, transactional processing and storage techniques.</p>
<p>Duration of the contract period.<br />Option Period 2: February 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017<br />Option Period 3: February 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018<br />Option Period 4: February 1, 2018 through January 31, 2019</p>
<p>Source. <br />CACI INTERPRISE SOLUTIONS INC.<br />14370 Newbrook Drive <br />Chantilly, Virginia 20151-4206<br />DUNS: 145070723</p>
<p>Statement of the reason justifying the lack of competition.<br />The projected orders under this contract are so integrally related that only a single contractor can reasonably perform the work, The DOI's Financial and Business Management System is a single application with multiple business modules and applications whose data moves in and out of the system. Having a single contractor support this type of environment is advantageous in regards to such a complex application. With a single award the contractor gains the perspective of the whole system and not just one business module.</p>
<p>CACI Inc. is the only source with the capability of providing the necessary systems expert personnel in an efficient, economical and timely manner to satisfy the Government's immediate requirement. CACI Inc. has the historical knowledge to produce the desired personnel with the required skills rapidly and via a cost-effective approach based on its experience and performance on the current BIO Assistance IDIQ contract and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agencies requirements.</p>

<p>Data Services Modernization and Feature Requirements<br />ETA's Information Management Reference Architecture including Data Management Layers and the progression of data from the Raw Data Reservoir to Foundation and then onto Access for increased data quality and enrichment, increased formalization of definition, increased "ease of use", simplified data model and reduced cost of query concurrency.<br />ETA's Data Ingestion, responsible for moving, cleaning and transforming data, as near real-time streaming, Extract Transform and Load (ETL) and Extract Load and Transform (ELT). <br />The Information Interpretation component to present information to ETA's external systems and services. It may interface with any of the data management layers. The Information Interpretation component will be implemented using a variety of Analytical, Data Science and BI tools. <br />High-Level Enterprise Data Services Technical Requirements using the components in the Information Management Reference Architecture as a foundation, including a scalable and balanced hardware platform. An ETA-wide capability to store and manage large volumes of data cost effectively, while meeting reliability, availability and performance service levels. <br />Functional capabilities for an efficient data load and transformation, in batch and real time scenarios as well as application-transparent optimizations for physical data models that will enable ETA systems to support high levels of concurrency and low query response times, even in ad-hoc query environments. <br />Tools to monitor, manage and optimize the environment as a whole and integrated analytics and feature-rich reporting capability for high performance Information Interpretation. <br />Data Modeling including Conceptual, Logical, Physical and Derived Model to answer the business questions and the logical relationships between different parts of the information and DOL's Governance and data integrity requirements may demand the use of certain constraints, primary keys and foreign keys and comparing the logical design with various physical attributes of enterprise database.<br />Hardware Architecture considerations require building a balanced infrastructure that is both reliable and easy to scale out quickly requires considerable expertise and not only delivers a reliable, high performance platform, but scalability is also fundamental to its design. It should also provide high-end design for extreme IO performance; the ability to read and write data at very high rates. <br />Absolute application transparency with enhanced scalability and performance is fundamental to the modern ETA Data Services design. Servers enabled scans and other resource-consuming features to be off-loaded away from the database servers and multiple nodes can be connected together using a unified InfiniBand fabric. <br />New Data as a service solution requires high performance interconnects between database servers and the storage infrastructure because queries and transformations are likely to read and write large volumes of data and a high performance data channel or interconnect is required between database servers to enable parallel processing to scale across a cluster of machines. <br />Industry level enterprise storage architecture that can distributes database IO across all available storage devices, and scale up (or down) capabilities in a seamless manner without outage. Assurance of efficiency and high performance for large table scans and other IO-intensive operations. All components in the storage infrastructure must be optimized to sustain high levels of IO throughput. <br />ETA-wide managing high data volumes ad larger tables must be partitioned for optimal and scalable data management. Similarly subdividing partitions into smaller sub-partitions that can be used to for improving query join and scan performance. <br />In addition data compression functionality to reduce the amount of storage space required for ETA's enterprise consolidated and relational environment. The advanced compression in different partitions can be subject to different compression choices including basic compression, OLTP compression (a component of the Advanced Compression option), and Hybrid Columnar Compression techniques. <br />Similarly the Data Services modernization may require the implementation of Raw Data Reservoirs to ingest data from applications and deliver data from a staging area for high performance systems. It should be designed and tested carefully to ensure that they will be capable of delivering data at the required rate. Network storage devices are likely to require multiple network paths to the database servers. The design can be leveraged with Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) for storing and processing very large volumes of data. <br />Moreover the new data services design should be capable enough to use external tables and provides a consistent, optimized and flexible approach to batch and micro-batch loading from raw data reservoirs implemented using "conventional" file systems. External tables created can be queried in the normal manner using standard SELECT statements. Master Data Management (MDM) based Data Services design should have the Batch Loading services capability for high-performance data loads. Direct path loading can be commonly used in combination with external tables. <br />Functionality for data replication and streaming to capture Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) changes made to database objects and replicate those changes to one or more other databases. ETA data streaming capability will require capture processes or synchronous capture captures changes made to source database objects and formats them into LCRs, which can be propagated to destination databases and then applied by data streams apply processes.<br />Handling ETA data coming from multiple programs and concurrent quarterly loads parallelism for query performance and parallel execution is a key requirement to utilize all available hardware resources effectively: multiple CPUs, multiple IO channels, multiple storage arrays and disk drives, and large volumes of memory. Auto degree of Parallelism should be used to invoke parallelism when it is appropriate meeting the SLAs in Cloud set-up.<br />Materialized views and data reusability approach for expensive repetitive queries to optimize runtime and OIST resource consumption. Queries will usually analyze a subset or aggregation of the detailed data, so a mechanism to pre-summarize and pre-aggregate data for direct use by queries offers the potential to improve query performance significantly for BI canned and ETA-wide ad-hoc reporting.<br />The next generation System Management capabilities should include data workload management including important components like Real Application Clusters (RAC), Database Resource Manager, IO Resource Manager and Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (EMCC), including enterprise data monitoring and optimizer Statistics management. <br />CURRENT ENVIRONMENT: <br />The Data Services solution must be capable of interfacing with the existing environment in order to eventually displace this functionality. The current Data Warehouse development, test, and production environments are built upon the following set of tools:<br />Environment #1<br />Data Tier: Oracle 10g/Oracle 11g<br />OS: Oracle Solaris<br />Space: 7TB<br />Growth is approximately 5 GB per month.</p>
<p>Environment #2<br />Data Tier: Sybase IQ/ MySQL<br />OS: MS Windows<br />Space: 2.4TB<br />Growth is approximately 5 GB per month.</p>
<p><br />CONSTRAINTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS:<br />All responses should be sure to include recommendations for optimal bandwidth, data storage, architectural components and any additional requirements to ensure optimum SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS capabilities are maximized.</p>
<p>ETA also desires to understand the best practices in managing onboarding of multiple data sources along with recommendations about how to manage loading of data into the warehouse including but not limited to architectural designs that provide maximum flexibility to consume large volumes of data while not limiting the access to the data from the users of the reporting tools (i.e. proposed methodologies, schedules, batch windows, etc).</p>
