It is very well<br />understood that global gene expression profile in biological samples change in response to<br />exposure to toxic agents. Therefore, determination of global gene expression changes in response<br />to exposure to a toxic agent and further analysis of the gene expression data will result in the<br />identification of mechanisms potentially underlying the toxicity of the agents being studied. The<br />next generation sequencing service will help us to obtain global gene expression data required to<br />understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of silica and diesel exhaust<br />particles. Our lab or any other lab at NIOSH, Morgantown, does not have the facility to do next<br />generation sequencing or any other technique that can be employed to determine global gene<br />expression profile in biological samples.<br />Project Objective<br />The project objective is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity due to exposure<br />to silica and diesel exhaust particles in a rat toxicity model.<br />Scope of Work<br />The Molecular Carcinogenesis Laboratory will isolate RNA from rats exposed to silica and diesel exhaust<br />particles. These RNA samples will then be sent to Genomics Sequencing Core, Biology Department,<br />Eberly College of Arts and Sciences, West Virginia University dba WVU Research Corporation to determine the gene expression profile<br />by next generation sequencing technique. The results will then be delivered electronically to the P.I. /<br />Molecular Carcinogenesis Laboratory for further analysis.<br />Technical Requirements<br />Genomics Sequencing Core, Biology Department, Eberly College of Arts and Sciences, West Virginia<br />University will supply all reagents, etc. and perform next generation sequencing using the next generation<br />sequencing system. The results will be delivered electronically to the P.I. / Molecular Carcinogenesis<br />Laboratory.<br />Reporting Schedule<br />The results will be delivered electronically to the P.I. / Molecular Carcinogenesis Laboratory upon<br />completion of the work.<br />Deliverables<br />The RNA samples will be personally delivered to the Genomics Sequencing Core, Biology Department,<br />Eberly College of Arts and Sciences, West Virginia University by the PI or another member of the<br />Molecular Carcinogenesis Laboratory.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent from the Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, Maryland to contract on an other than full and open competition basis with Zel Technologies, LLC Hampton, VA for specific Engineering Investigations (EIs), consisting of Multi-Spectral Electromagnetic (EM) and Electro-Optical (EO) Propagation through atmospheric, marine, and land environments for the U.S. Naval Non-Acoustic Anti-Submarine Warfare (NAASW) mission support. Zel Technologies, LLC (Zel) shall perform research and evaluation of remote sensing technologies, initially focusing on (but not limited to) the following areas: radar, radiometry, infrasound, and hydrodynamics. This contract will also provide for procurement of these aforementioned efforts with the ability to integrate Foreign National Non-traditional ASW programs with emphasis on foreign scientific research in radar ocean sensing. Zel employs personnel with many years of scientific investigation and unique S&amp;T experience in the fields of Multi-Spectral Electromagnetic and Electro-Optical phenomenology. Zel has developed scientific tools such as models, algorithms, and simulations that are essential to investigate the underpinning physics related to atmospheric or ocean surface modification produced by underwater objects, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements in a timely basis. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable cost, schedule and programmatic risks which would result in failure to fulfill the NAASW's requirements. This Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements). The total estimated dollar value of this procurement is estimated to be $7,880.000.00. The period of performance for this procurement will be five years (Base and 4 Option years). This is not a solicitation. No RFP will be issued on the basis of this Notice of Intent. See numbered Note(s) 22.</p>

<a href="mailto:James.E.Kitahara@nasa.gov">Jim  Kitahara</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/AFRC (formerly DFRC) in-conjunction with NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement for SOFIA Aircraft Modification and Mission Systems Technical Support. The requirement is to provide transitory engineering and technical support to enable the orderly transition from the developmental phase to the sustaining engineering phase of the program.  Technical support tasks will include the following: Transfer of knowledge of the SOFIA Mission Control and Communication Subsystem (MCCS), Platform Interface System (PIS), and Telescope Assembly Image Processing Subsystem (TAIPS) software code; and temporary continued engineering support for the immediate serviceability (and limited development of new capabilities and upgrades) for the PIS and TAIPS software code.  Upon completion of the knowledge transfer and engineering services transition, NASA/AFRC and NASA/ARC intend to perform the sustaining engineering phase of the program in-house. <p> NASA/AFRC intends to acquire the services directly from L-3 Communications Integrated Systems, Waco, Texas (i.e. the SOFIA platform developer). Authority for this action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2), which implements the Statutory Authority from 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), for the acquisition of supplies and services from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Due to the specific technical nature of the requirement, award to any other service provider would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Additionally, the time required for any other service provider to gain the required technical understanding of the SOFIA related hardware systems and software code would result in unacceptable schedule delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. The award of the contemplated contract will be subject to the availability of funds for Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. PST time on June 16, 2014. Such capabilities/qualifications will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <p> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>  . <p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a non-competitive contract to the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) located at 4015 Fair Ridge Drive Fairfax, VA 22033.
<p>The United States Fire Administration (USFA), in coordination with fire service organizations has maintained a continuous program of support of health and safety of volunteer fire and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) departments and responders throughout the country.</p>
<p>The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of the purchase order is to procure the services to continue the development of the National Safety Culture Change Initiative to provide additional outreach and educational resources focusing on key individual and organizational behaviors identified in the previous study with the IAFC on the Study of Behavioral Motivation on Reduction of Risk Taking Behaviors which identified major factors that adversely impact on firefighter health and safety.</p>
<p>This project would continue to and enhance the support and advocacy for the need of a culture change in the fire service - incorporating organizational leadership and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>The IAFC and their (IAFC) Safety, Health, and Survival (SHS) Section have a long history of performing successful complex fire service health and safety studies for both the USFA and the fire service in general, including the FY 2012 Study of Behavioral Motivation on Reduction of Risk Taking Behaviors of which this FY 2014 National Safety Culture Change Initiative Study is based on which makes them uniquely qualified. This requirement is intended to augment and expand the 2012 study.</p>
<p>Founded in 1873, the IAFC and their staff have tremendous experience and credibility among the U.S. fire service. They are the only national, if not international organization, with a 141 year history of serving the needs of fire service leadership.</p>
<p>IAFC has proprietary oversight of their Safety, Health, and Survival (SHS) Section which serves as a national level focal point of management expertise in firefighter health and safety. The IAFC SHS has the unique ability to reach across all aspects of the fire service by working with the IAFC Metro Chiefs to reach the large fire departments and the career fire service, the IAFC Volunteer and Combination Officers Section (VCOS), small fire departments, the volunteer fire service, the IAFC Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Section, and others whose participation is imperative to the successful completion of this study. Because of this broad outreach, the IAFC SHS has the ability to implement the findings of this project and develop support and advocacy for the need of a culture change in the fire service through organizational leadership and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>IAFC SHS members serve on many national-level consensus standards committees in numerous areas involving firefighter and EMS responder health and safety. The SHS organizational and memberships experience and knowledge related to this topic will be utilized and incorporated into this project. Other organizations would not be able to develop the involvement and support of the IAFC SHS Section.</p>
<p>Additionally, the IAFC will establish a dedicated section on the National Safety Culture Change Initiative for the Fire Service on their website that will greatly expand the outreach of its new findings, which is an integral part of this study. This IAFC website is well known and utilized among the fire and emergency services community to access information on fire service operational safety. The IAFC would not allow any other organization(s) access to the site.</p>
<p>as a result of the study the IAFC will provide outreach of the results at IAFC-sponsored national level fire service leadership conferences, including Fire Rescue International as well as other proprietary fire service resources administered by their organization. <br />Because of their long term reputation to the fire service, the IAFC would not support or endorse such outreach performed by other entities at their proprietary conference.</p>
<p>All of this organizational and staff history related to conducting complex fire service health and safety studies, especially those targeted for fire service leadership, will benefit this study.</p>
<p>The contractor must be able to meet core capabilities required for this requirement as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Expertise in conducting complex fire service health and safety studies for local fire departments at the national level, especially those targeted for fire service leadership and change of the safety culture in the fire service;<br />&bull; Promote and provide national level leadership education and training for local level fire departments;<br />&bull; Gather applicable information from and disseminate information to fire service leadership of fire departments from the United States Fire Administration (USFA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS);<br />&bull; Serve as the voice and advocate for fire service leadership in the national arena and provide tools, resources, and programs in health and safety for fire and EMS departments and responders;<br />&bull; Conduct research, develop training, collect information and distribute that information which has an impact on health and safety for fire chiefs, firefighters, and EMS responders, including linkage to and utilization the resources of the IAFC's Safety, Health, and Survival Section, as well as national level fire service leadership conferences including the IAFC's Fire Rescue International.<br />&bull; Experience with performance of successfully conducting complex fire service health and safety studies for local fire departments at the national level, especially those targeted for fire service leadership and change of the safety culture in the fire service, for both the USFA and the fire service in general;<br />&bull; Existing mechanism to deliver outreach, information, and training targeted toward fire service leadership and the fire services, specifically utilizing the resources of the IAFC's Safety, Health, and Survival Section, as well as national level fire service leadership conferences including the IAFC's Fire Rescue International;<br />&bull; Experience with the development and delivery of national level materials targeted specifically for fire service leadership related to changing the culture of the fire service at all levels. This would include the National Safety Culture Change Initiative and the Study of Behavioral Motivation on Reduction of Risk Taking Behaviors.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) determined that the IAFC is uniquely qualified to perform this work. This purchase order will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications demonstrating their ability to provide these services via email to Jane Huwig-Leister no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on June 10, 2014. Email address for receipt of capabilities and qualifications is jane.huwig-leister@fema.dhs.gov</p>
<p>Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotation/proposals.</p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>:
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive sole source basis to Appistry Inc., 1141 South 7th Street, Suite 300, St. Louis, MO 63104 to procure the following:</p>
<p><strong>PROCUREMENT</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Service runs and analysis covering up to 60 whole genomes, Quantity: up to Sixty (60).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. <br />NHGRI Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA will be isolated from all admitted Undiagnosed Diseases patients and family members. Depending on the phenotype of the patient, these DNA samples will be sent for exome sequencing as the first step to obtain variant information that may determine the mechanism of the patients' disease. It is necessary for the Undiagnosed Diseases Laboratory to then perform extensive analyses on the large amount of exome sequencing and variant data that s generated in a timely manner to facilitate genetic studies when combined with SNP analysis. This information will then be used to perform research experiments to discern the genetic and molecular basis of the unique disease of the patient.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</strong>:</p>
<p>Appistry Ayrris has been integrated with the RURO LIMS 24/7 system that allows for a continuous pipeline that makes collecting, storing, managing and routing data simple, reliable and efficient. This has enabled the NIH UDP laboratory to establish and maintain a full change of custody for samples and associated data across the experimental life cycle, standardize physical and digital processes to achieve compliance with specific regulations, and create production-grade workflows necessary for the laboratory. They have executed the NIH UDP Diploid-Alignment Pipeline on Ayrris and integrated this pipeline within LIMS 24/7 that allows users to monitor the progress of the pipelines without requiring detailed knowledge of how the pipeline is executing.

If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for delivering Brocade Storage Hardware for the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC). Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis then the Bill of Materials.
<p>The Air Force anticipates a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded. The Air Force anticipates a delivery 30 - 45 days after receipt of the order. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 334112, size standard 1,000 employees. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Managment database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>

<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.

Any firms believing that they can provide the materials may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than five (5) days after the date of publication of this notice. <br />While a final decision has not been determined, the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is preliminarily set as 326299 with a size standard of 500 employees. A set-aside determination has not been made.<br />1.2 Details. It is emphasized that this Sources Sought is for planning and information purposes only, it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Pursuant to FAR 52.215-3, this Request for Information (RFI) Sources Sought is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations. Information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. <br />2.0 SCOPE OVERVIEW:<br />2.1 Statement of Need. This is not a request for Proposal, Quotation, or Invitation for bid notice. The following information is included as a description of the current requirements/scope: The 772d Test Squadron (TS), Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement to provide electromagnetic energy absorption, in the medium and standard power, handling ranges of 3 watts per square inch and 0.5 watts per square inch for use in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF). This capability requires increased power handling (medium power) performance to accommodate high power systems, without major degradation of reflectivity performance across frequency. The overall use of Radar Absorbing Material (RAM) is to eliminate multi-path reflections within the chamber. <br />The requirement is for a total of 180 pieces size; base is 24" x 24" length and depth and pyramidal height 24" up to 26", medium-powered pyramidal absorber at 3 watts per square inch maximum CW power handling. And 640 pieces size; base is 24" x 24" length and depth and pyramidal height 24" up to 26", standard-power pyramidal absorber at 0.5 watts per square inch maximum CW power handling. All pieces will have hook-and-loop fastener (Velcro&reg; style) backing (820 each) on the base of each piece.<br />Applicable documents: 1) IEEE Standard 1128 - "Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz" 2) NRL Report 8093, 1, 2, and 3.<br />3.0 REQUIREMENTS: <br />3.1 Reflectivity Attenuation Testing for RAM. Frequency reflectivity measurements are required for each lot. <br />3.1.2 Data Delivery Requirements. All data collected for frequency testing must be provided on or before date of RAM delivery. Each measurement plot must identify, by serial number, which pieces were tested for that plot and a table must be provided to show which serial numbers belong to which lot. Delivered data must include frequency-attenuation graphs.<br />3.2 Manufacturing constraints.<br />3.2.1 RAM Glue lines. Due to the multi-use test nature of the BAF, glue lines are generally undesirable for high frequency BAF tests. If any manufactured RAM will include any seams whatsoever, the seams must be characterized for possible performance degradation. Appropriate data and graphs must be provided. The seam lines are to be specified. <br />3.2.2 RAM Design. The RAM required shall be of standard Vent/polyurethane pyramid design with 9 pyramids per RAM piece for base size: 24" x 24" length and depth and pyramidal height 24" up to 26". The RAM paint color will be selected after contract award from vendor's standard palette but will be other than standard blue to differentiate medium power RAM pieces from low-power pieces already in use within the BAF.<br />3.2.3 Footprint Size Tolerance. The RAM shall be manufactured to a 24 inch by 24 inch base with a maximum size tolerance of +0.25 inch/-0.25 inch.<br />3.2.4 Physical Integrity Requirement. The RAM must not shed or leach carbon and fire retardants through the outer paint. <br />3.2.5 Loading and Fire Retardant Binders. The RAM manufacturing processing must use a binder for both the loading ingredients and fire retardant ingredients.<br />3.3 Fire Retardancy. Independently test the flammability of the RAM's manufacturing method to meet the fire retardancy required by NRL Report 8093 (test 1, 2, and 3). <br />3.4 Physical Characteristics for RAM. The physical description for the RAM, base 24-inches deep by 24 inches length by 24-26 inches in height pyramidal, is provided in the table below:<br />Overall Height Between 24 inches and 26 inches +/-0.5 inch<br />Overall RAM Footprint 24 inches square (24" x 24") +0.25/-0.25 inch <br />Pyramids per piece 9 per 24" x 24" base (height of pyramid can be between 24 and 26 inches)<br />Pyramid Shape Standard pyramid<br />Fire Retardancy IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3)<br />RAM Material Open cell Vent/Polyurethane absorber<br />4.0 RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS<br />4.1 The AFTC is seeking capability statements from potential sources for the purpose of aiding in the acquisition planning for this requirement. All written documents shall be in Microsoft Word and shall be no more than 10 pages in length (8.5"x 11", using not smaller than a 12 point font). <br />5.0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />5.1 A one-page summary shall be included with the capability statement, which identifies the company's specific capabilities that are relevant to the requirement. In addition, the summary should also include the following: Name and address of company, number of employees, type of business ownership (i.e., Large Business, Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business,8(a) Business, HUB Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Veteran-Owned Small Business), and location of the business.

<DESC>Information for Army Exam and Survey Application <br>  <br> THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of Market Research being conducted by the Mission and Installation Contract Command, Fort Eustis to identify existing commercial software applications that will provide an Army Exam and Survey Application (AESA) to automate the management and administration of online exams and survey products and if this effort can be unrestricted. This is not a request for proposal (RFP). <br>  <br> Problem Statement:  The Army uses web-based applications for distributed learning.  These applications automate course scheduling, registration, training administration, testing, record keeping, reporting, collaboration, course delivery, and other training support functions. Some of these applications also deliver exams and surveys to the student.  There are thousands of exams and associated sets of question banks, answer keys, and test items, including multiple versions of exams and end-of-course surveys, all of which must be controlled and managed.  In addition, the Army needs to control the process for exam and survey development, testing, assembly, and publishing.  These exams and surveys must undergo a technically complex development and testing process for assembly into tiered data structures across two (or more) automated hosting platforms.  Currently more than seventy (70) different Army/DoD organizations develop online exams and surveys and each may need its own secure organizational domain for development, testing, and storage of content. The Army requires a commercial software application to create, store, manage, administer, and deliver exams and surveys to learners.   <br>  <br> AESA Desired Capabilities:  The Army's intent is acquire a COTS application with licenses to store, manage and administer all online exams and surveys using one centralized Web-based system that is integrated with existing training management systems. Students will use this system to take online exams and surveys as components of training/education curricula or as stand-alone products supporting classroom instruction. Trainers will use the application to import individual question/answer combinations from other training systems or create and store exams directly through a user interface (UI). Instructors/proctors will use the application to remotely administer exams and surveys to students in either synchronous or asynchronous modes. Training managers will use the application to obtain pre-formatted or custom reports from a database composed of individual student exam/survey question responses. The Army will use the AESA to close a large, existing capability gap in online exam training management and administration at the enterprise level. <br>  <br> The AESA should use an online enterprise approach to manage the lifecycle of exam content and related historical data including content development, content testing, exam updating, and student access to/completion of exams.  The AESA should provide near-real time interfaces or data exchange with other Army training systems.  The AESA must accept and process exam/survey registration data from external systems and provide status and completion data back to those systems.  The AESA must exchange user identity, user authentication, learning object identity and related data, registration and completion data, etc. with other systems.  A single software application is desired; however, an alternate solution may be comprised of a combination of applications that, working together, provide all or most of the features shown below. <br>  <br> The AESA should: <br>   <br> * Be web-accessible to all users with no client-side plug-ins or applets required.  <br> * Operate in the .com and .mil networks (Must be US Army Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) NetOps compliant1). <br> * Operate as stand-alone or in combination with other automated business systems using data provided by them or providing data to them. <br> * Process validated direct user access requests ( quote mark stand-alone quote mark  mode) from external systems performing identification and authorization (I&A) when an access request is provided directly to the AESA. <br> * Process valid user exam or survey requests redirected to the AESA from external training systems.  <br> * Store user account data including selected user profile elements and update these elements upon login. <br> * Match user access requests against known user accounts.   <br> * Automatically create and store new accounts for authorized users. <br> * Comply with data protection laws, Army policies, and industry information assurance best practices. Online exam materials are considered to be sensitive but unclassified. The AESA will not store classified information. <br> * Provide survey user identity anonymity at the reporting level.  <br> * Meet requirements for (or already have) an Army Certificate of Networthiness (CON) and Army Approval to Operate (ATO) in the Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET). <br> * Track workflow status across the lifecycle of the exam or survey, including content development and testing, fielding and delivery, content revision, recoding or other sustainment actions, retirement, and archiving. <br> * Import/upload functionalities for common media file types to include jpg, wav, mpeg, etc. <br> * Resume functions after interruption without loss of data. <br> * Deliver exams and surveys to, and obtain responses/results from, Android, iOS, or Windows mobile devices.  <br> * Employ a range of question parameters, including weighting, sub-setting, partial crediting. <br> * Support organization of exam questions into sub-sets up to two levels.  <br> * Establish and maintain searchable associations between question/answer combinations and learning objectives.   <br> * Insert objects, composed of common types of media files, into exams or individual question/answer combinations. <br> * Provide built-in user interfaces for exam development, administration and delivery (exam/survey-taking environment). <br> * Assign and maintain user roles as part of profile data for use in controlling system permissions, access privileges, etc. <br> * Restrict access of exams, exam components, and related materials to users authorized by system-enforced security/job roles and organizational domains. <br> * Provide configurable controls to limit student attempts on exams. <br> * Establish configurable controls to specify exam performance feedback detail at the learning object level. <br> * Provide aggregated reports at the individual exam response level that support  quote mark test-item analysis quote mark . <br> * Support UI searches based on user name, unique identifier, questions, learning objective, exam or survey title/version number, organization/domain, or date range. <br> * Provide configurable audit capability (user, date/time, action, reason) for specified objects and fields (create/edit/delete activities.) <br> * Associate (assign) users with specific exam(s) from the UI or in bulk via import. <br>  <br> The AESA should support:  <br>  <br> * Various/multiple types of question formats, such as hot spot, drag and drop, matching, multiple choice/one or more correct, True/False, short answer/essay <br> * Upload and storage of student files, such as written assignments in response to exam requirements, within specified time limits. <br> * Electronic signatures from learners in support of student assessment verification. <br> * Optional bookmarking during an exam session with re-authentication upon resumption. <br> * Reuse of stored exam/survey questions/response combinations. <br> * User-defined multi-level organization of questions and assessments into exam sections with sectional scoring against configurable mastery score definitions and reporting of overall results and results by section. <br> * Custom  quote mark branding quote mark  of the UI for exam or survey presentation windows at organizational level. <br> * Knowledge-based test question types described in TRADOC Pam 350-70-5 (http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/p350-70-5.pdf). <br> * Import (bulk) and manual input of individual exam results from external assessments. <br> * Pre-formatted and customizable report templates. <br> * Designation of a proctor role with associated permissions such as testing with live face-to-face proctors or testing with a remote proctor using webcam and other authenticating devices. <br> * Establishment of durations for individual exams, set/control actual exam start/stop times, and allow reset of testing time limits by instructors/proctors.   <br> * Multiple instances of the same scheduled exam and user selection of specific exam events by location and date/ time.  <br>  <br> There is a 20-page limitation on technical information responses.

<DESC>Introduction:  This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to solicit responses from the broader spaceport community to enable KSC to continue its transformation into a multi-user spaceport.	This transformation is based upon the effective utilization of land assets that have been identified in the 2013-2032 KSC Master Plan.  This RFI is intended as a means to identify potential partnership opportunities for: the expansion of non-NASA launch operations and launch support functions at KSC; activities related to the assembly and processing of payloads or launch vehicles; and/or additional ventures that encourage activities in space.	 The Master Plan describes the vision and supporting activities that will enable KSC to continue to evolve into a multi-user spaceport supporting both government and commercial operations.  Purpose of this RFI: The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to identify potential partners who are interested in developing vacant land consistent with the land use requirements outlined in the KSC Master Plan. To assist respondents in understanding the geographic area and related land use requirements is the KSC Master Plan Future Land Use Map (Attachment 1).  The Future Land Use Map shows the extent of Functional Areas and where potential operations will be located.  Respondents will need to visit the KSC Master Plan website at <A HREF="http://masterplan.ksc.nasa.gov/">http://masterplan.ksc.nasa.gov/ </A>	   to obtain Land Use Descriptions and Future Development details.  It is important for respondents to understand the land use descriptions and future development details in order to submit a useful response.  A question and answer period will be available as a part of this RFI.  Respondents having questions regarding land uses or other issues should submit questions to the Points of Contact listed below, on or before 12:00 pm local time on June 10, 2014.  All questions received by this date will be answered.  NASA will disclose all questions received and provide the respective answers via an amendment to this RFI.  Questions received after the due date will not be answered.  <p> This RFI asks responders to: 	Describe the intended use for the development and specific locational requirements they may have (e.g. line-of-sight, near transportation corridor, etc.). 	Describe the operational requirements of the proposed development, including an ideal and minimum land requirement (in acres), estimated height requirement for buildings/structures, and the types of hazardous operations that may occur within the property. 	Describe the timeframe for the proposed development. 	Describe the preferred duration of KSC Land Use.  Note:  NASA policies and land use requirements may place restrictions on term length. If NASA determines that it is in the governments best interest to make vacant land available, formal competitive announcement(s) may be issued at a later date.  Competitive announcement(s) would provide all potential respondents a fair opportunity to propose and request land for development.  NASA expects potential partner(s) to be fully responsible for the development, construction, operations, and maintenance of the facility and land. NASA KSC also seeks to ensure broad awareness and visibility of this RFI.   All categories of U.S. domestic entities including commercial, federal and state organizations are encouraged to submit responses to this RFI. Response Instructions: The requested responses are for information and planning purposes for NASA KSC only. NASA does not intend to post information or questions received to any website or public access location, except for the question and answer period described above. NASA does not plan to respond to the individual responses received from this RFI. NASA reserves the right to share all information received in response to this RFI throughout NASA and with its Federal and State Government Partners. It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained through this RFI; therefore, if proprietary information is included, it should be clearly marked. NASA will protect such data from public disclosure to the extent permitted under the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations. All responses must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF) via email to both: Steve.Parker@nasa.gov and nancy.a.potts@nasa.gov Font should be Times New Roman, size 12. Responses should not exceed five (5) pages and should reference RFI-KSC-Land-Assets-2014. Responses are due on or before 12:00 pm local time, July 11, 2014. Responses received after the due date may not be considered. Respondents will be sent an acknowledgment upon receipt of their response. NASA reserves the right to conduct follow-up interviews with respondents to clarify responses, if needed. Additional Information: This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract or other type of agreement. Moreover, the Government will not pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will the Government reimburse respondents for costs incurred to prepare responses to this RFI. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Services (NAIS). It is the respondents responsibility to monitor these sites for release of any solicitation or synopsis. NASA reserves the right to amend or withdraw this Request for Information at any time. Comments and Questions: Comments and questions must be submitted in writing via email to both Steve Parker (steve.parker@nasa.gov) and Nancy Potts (nancy.a.potts@nasa.gov), by 12:00 p.m. local time on June 10, 2014.

These studies are aimed at investigating regional brain structure and function in normal individuals and in patients with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. During the course of these experiments, behavioral and neurophysiological data are collected, which, along with the large volumes of neuroimaging data, constitute enormous databases that require large-scale storage systems, several layers of database management software, and multiple levels of database-specific security measures.<br /></span></p>

Each page should be separately numbered.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />4.1 GENERAL <br /><br />A high priority for modernizing the Peace Corps is to more effectively use technology to drive innovation, be more efficient, and improve the lives of people in the developing world through the work of over 7,000 Peace Corps Volunteers serving in 65 countries. Our vision for technology includes these goals: <br />&bull; More efficient operations: Modernize our IT platforms and systems to put us on par with leading organizations, streamline operations, recruit and support the best and brightest people to serve in the Peace Corps, and ensure that staff and Volunteers can easily collaborate anywhere, anytime, on any device. &bull; Drive culture of innovation and openness: Develop a modern, holistic IT Strategy that allows us to be flexible, innovative, and adapt to a rapidly changing global technology environment, drives openness and autonomy, and uses open data for strategic decision-making. <br />&bull; Improve development outcomes: Expand Volunteers&rsquo; access to digital tools and resources so they can promote the use of technology to achieve sustainable results in health, education, economic growth, the environment, and other sectors. <br />&bull; Communicate impact: Empower everyone who is connected with the Peace Corps to use digital technology to more effectively convey the work and impact of Peace Corps. Expand our presence in digital communities to share and discuss the tremendous work Volunteers are doing in their communities and how Returned Volunteers continue to make a difference after they complete their service. <br /><br />To achieve these goals, the Peace Corps is seeking strategic management services to assist us in developing new operating models and new, innovative approaches to technology that are drawn from leading thinkers and organizations and that can be applied in a large-scale, global environment. <br /><br />The challenges facing the Peace Corps and its technology operations are complex and inter-related. One of the most pressing challenges (and opportunities) is the fact that we work in 65 countries around the world, with vastly different levels of access to technology, broadband capabilities, and network reliability. Some of our overseas posts have the same level of connectivity as we experience in the U.S., while others have very low bandwidth capabilities, which can change from day to day. While this is the current state, we want to ensure that we&rsquo;re planning for what the future holds in terms of expected worldwide growth in technology. <br /><br />The Peace Corps must also be prepared to operate in a 24/7 environment since our mission is to support the safety and security of over 7,000 Volunteers in the field. In addition, we have a large domestic footprint, with 7 Regional Recruitment offices and hundreds of part-time recruiters at college campuses across the country. This is partly what makes our mission unique &ndash; we are supporting a very large, global, and distributed network of both staff and Volunteers. While Peace Corps Volunteers are not employees of the federal government and thus have a different status than staff, they are the heart and soul of our organization. Frequently, Volunteers bring the latest technology solutions and modern thinking to their work, but are sometimes hampered by a headquarters operation that is not aligned or not always attuned to their needs. We need to ensure that we&rsquo;re constantly thinking about the environment of Volunteers and recruitment staff &ldquo;on the ground.&rdquo; We want to address this challenge by creating a technology ecosystem that is dynamic and adaptable to global changes -- and enables staff and Volunteers to easily collaborate and support each other using whatever digital tools and technology they need to be successful. We also want to take advantage of the fact that technology advancements, such as cloud computing, mobile devices, big data, and grid computing have allowed leading organizations to provide greater information ingestion, processing, and dissemination capabilities at greater scales. There&rsquo;s also a tremendous opportunity to take advantage of newer operating models for getting work done, such as crowdsourcing solutions, iterative and incremental development cycles, flexible staffing approaches, etc. We also have a cultural opportunity to take advantage of: the changing behaviors and expectations that Peace Corps Volunteers and new entrants to the workforce bring with them. These expectations include information devices and services that are highly interactive and promote information sharing, collaboration, and innovation. We can extend these behaviors, and the more open culture they support, into business policies, practices, and processes.<br />&nbsp;<br />Additional challenges facing the agency and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) include the expected exponential growth of content and data holdings, as advances in data collection technologies increase both the resolution and frequency of collection. Along with this rapid growth in data volume and technology, cyber security concerns continue to rise with each new, increasingly sophisticated threat. An additional challenge is the availability of skilled technology workers and the frequent turnover of Peace Corps staff, partly due to a unique term limit of five years imposed on most staff. This can lead to a fundamental loss of institutional knowledge and experience, most notably among IT staff. <br /><br />In addition, our expectation is that budget levels will remain relatively static, which can make it challenging to fund needed transformation efforts. <br /><br />We must find innovative ways to approach these challenges. One path is to develop an implementation roadmap that identifies incremental programs, whose funding can be identified and independently justified, but which, when taken as a whole, will transform the agency&rsquo;s and the OCIO&rsquo;s business model, business practices, operating culture, and technology. Our approach to addressing this complexity is to pursue a comprehensive transformation, with innovation and adaptability as the core concept. <br /><br />4.2 LIST OF TASKS <br /><br />The Contractor will provide the capabilities to assist Peace Corps in evolving and implementing its IT strategy, and will provide capabilities to support four Service Areas of Strategic Management: IT Strategy Services, Decision Support Services, Enterprise Architecture Services, and Project Management Services.<br /><br />To be fully successful, the Peace Corps is seeking a Contractor with broad and deep expertise in all aspects of information technology, not just in one specific subject area or domain. The Contractor must have deep technical expertise to look across the different aspects of IT and assist us in developing holistic, integrated strategies that support our agency environment and culture. The Contractor must have experience helping leading organizations and federal agencies to transform their IT strategies on a very broad scale. In particular, we are seeking a Contractor with experience working in a global environment, particularly in the developing world. <br /><br />4.2.1 IT Strategy Services<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide services to assist the Peace Corps in developing, implementing, and continuously refining its IT Strategy. It will include the following deliverables: <br />&#9679; IT and Digital Strategy: Identify the major technology, social, and business trends that will impact the Peace Corps in the near- and long-term future, and determine how to translate those trends into an effective and forward-looking Digital and IT Strategy. <br />&#9679; Current IT structure, staffing, and operations: Assess current state of IT operations across the agency. Determine the current capacity (staffing, skills, and infrastructure) for the Peace Corps to deliver tools for staff, Volunteers, and other customers to innovate, collaborate, and be effective in a rapidly changing and diverse technology environment. Assess the effectiveness of the OCIO and other offices to use technology to achieve Peace Corps&rsquo; strategic priorities, deliver results, and achieve efficiencies across the organization.<br />&#9679; Management / cultural issues: Identify and evaluate the management and cultural issues that impede or facilitate implementation of a &ldquo;future-leaning&rdquo; IT strategy, including office structure and leadership, policy and decision-making processes, budget and staffing, employee morale and attitudes toward IT/digital, risk tolerance, and working within the federal space. <br />&#9679; Case studies / best practices: Compile examples from organizations that have implemented comprehensive IT strategies, particularly those with a large global footprint like Peace Corps. Assess lessons learned (good and bad) and identify best practices that can be applied to Peace Corps. <br />&#9679; Recommendations: Provide findings and recommendations to strengthen Peace Corps&rsquo; IT Strategy and Operations, based on the analysis above. <br />&#9679; Road Map: Based on the recommendations, deliver a high-level Roadmap for the next 1-3 years that lays out the steps Peace Corps should stake to implement the IT Strategy. The Roadmap should include prioritizing those actions and investments that will have the biggest impact. <br /><br />4.2.2 Decision Support Services<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide decision support services to enable more efficient and effective business and technical decision making. Executive decision support must include change and communication management in order to ensure the workforce is aware and prepared to implement any decision made. <br /><br />Decision support at Peace Corps ensures actions taken by individuals and groups are consistent with Peace Corps&rsquo; mission, vision and goals and can be depended upon to operate in a self-directed manner. Peace Corps&rsquo; system of decision support provides the thrust necessary to jump start, develop and sustain desired behaviors in the identification development, implementation and evaluation of IT projects and services.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
VA Survey of Veteran Enrollees' Health and Utilization of Health Care

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought is to identify qualified small business contractors who are able to meet Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requirements and gather other readily available market information.

This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to form a binding contract.  The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI.  Further, the Department of Veterans Affairs is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals or any cost or pricing data. Personal Services contractors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the contractor. All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned.

Background

VHA is a part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and administers the largest integrated health care system in the nation.  In October 1996, Congress enacted the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-262).  Among other requirements, this law required that VHA implement a priority-based enrollment system.  

It is critical for VHA to understand enrolled Veterans' health care needs and their use of VA health care services and programs relative to their use of any non-VA health care services and programs (i.e. VA reliance).  In addition, the role demographic and socioeconomic factors play in enrolled Veterans' health care usage patterns is important to VHA's planning process.  

The major vehicle for obtaining this data is the annual "VA Survey of Veteran Enrollees' Health and Utilization of Health Care" (Survey of Enrollees).  There is no other valid or current information available in VHA's administrative databases on all enrollees' health status, income, and "reliance" upon the VA healthcare delivery system.


With increasing reliance on web-based social networking for communication and decreasing use of land-based telephone lines in an increasingly mobile society, VHA expanded  the scope of this project in 2012 to include multi-mode survey techniques.  Statistical understanding of the implications of moving to a multi-mode format is critical to the success of this project.

Description of Tasks

Task 1: Development of Methodological tests to reduce survey bias

The contractor will gather additional information on outcomes, test alternative procedures, and conduct methodological research to improve the methodology of this survey and assess the quality of information in the sampling frame of administrative records as well as potential survey bias.  This may include 1) advice to VA on how to enhance the coding of case level outcomes to better understand reasons for survey bias or 2.) research that may include tracing Veterans with inadequate contact information, and testing strategies for identifying and handling Veterans residing in institutions, etc., to correct for observed biases.  A separate report will be required discussing testing conducted, outcomes, and recommendations.  The report will be shared with OMB.

Task 2: Pre-survey Preparation

2.1 Sample Design and weighting schedule:  VHA has permission from OMB to interview up to 42,080 Veterans each year.  VHA's current sample design stratifies by geographic location, enrollee priority group, and pre/post enrollee status.  In addition, oversampling of special populations is considered on a year to year basis.  Conclusions about the universe of enrollees must be able to be extrapolated from sample.  

A minimum of successful interviews will be required for each priority group within each enrollment group within each VISN.  Current sample allocation is as follows: 125 interviews for priority groups one through five, at least 250 for combined priority group six/seven/eight, and priority group six sampled at the same rate as priority group seven/eight.  

VHA will work with contractor to reach appropriate size for stratified random sample.  Sample will be used both in field-testing of survey instrument and data collection.

Contractor will complete complex weighting schedule, incorporating health measures into the non-response (and frame coverage) adjustment to mitigate biases in the survey response data. This adjustment corrects for the differential non-response by health utilization and demographic information.  The contractor will perform non-response bias adjustments to correct for observed biases, i.e. between those enrollees with and without valid contact information and provide analysis to evaluate the impact, and perform weights and adjustment for non-response bias.

2.2 Survey Instrument Refinement and Conversion: Contractor will be asked to assist in assessing and refining the survey instrument for question clarity, ease of understanding and usability.  VHA ADUSH/P&P will provide contractor with survey in Microsoft Word format.  The contractor will be expected to convert the survey tool into the appropriate format for a multi-mode survey administration (CATI, PAPI, CAWI).

2.3 Survey pre-test: Contractor will test the survey instrument on a small sample of Veterans to ensure that results will achieve VA's expectation.  All modes of survey administration will be used in this pre-test.  VA staff will be enabled to listen in on CATI pre-test.  This pre-test will be used to test item wording and skip patterns.  It should also be large enough to test the response distributions on new or key questions.  

2.4: Pre-Survey Notification letters will be sent to each sampled enrollee.  Depending on survey mode(s) selected, letters may be modified to suit the method of delivery.  Contractor will provide VHA with recommended survey content.  The letter will include a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding the survey's purpose, describe the information that will be collected, provide information about the VA office conducting the survey and the contractor performing the survey, and indicate when the survey call should be expected or the when the survey should be completed.  

The contractor will create groups of replicates to release for data collection. The contractor will direct the printer when to release the series of replicates for the most expeditious fielding of the survey.  The contractor will have in place address validation protocols required for bulk mailing and will articulate their protocols in their proposal.

Task 3: Data Collection

Contractor will have up to 18 weeks to collect 42,000 completed interviews stratified as agreed to in sample plan.  Contractor will provide weekly updates on progress towards completed interviews and alert COR immediately if project is at risk of not being successfully completed within designated timeframe.

Contractor will alert COR via e-mail of any adverse events immediately upon occurrence and follow up within 24 hours with a written report.  Contractor will need the capability to facilitate a warm transfer to the VA Crisis line in the event that a caller reaches a Veteran who needs assistance.  Contractor will forward any returned letters to COR on a bi-weekly basis.  Similarly, Contractor will forward copies of any written correspondence, including comments noted in PAPI white space to the COR on a bi-weekly basis.

Task 4: Data Results

4.1 Summarization: All data collected will be compiled and summarized into a final survey file in SAS (or other mutually agreed to format) for analysis.  Data summarization will include file cleaning and editing, and data will be accessible by Enrollee Type, VISN, Priority Group, and any identified special population.  Weighting adjustment, documentation, and program code to allow VA to calculate the weights on subsequent surveys will accompany data set.

4.2 Contractor will provide a written Methods report documenting Survey collection methods.  At a minimum, this will include sample design and allocation, response and cooperation rates, data collection methods and results by mode, and weighting adjustments.

4.3 Methodological Experiments Findings: Contractor will provide a separate report describing methodological tests and subsequent findings.


4.4 A Survey Results report for public dissemination will describe the survey results as generalized to the overall VA Enrollee population.  At a minimum, the report will discuss the general demographics, Public and Private Health Insurance Coverage, Prescription Use, Key Drivers of Enrollee Use of VA Health Care, self-reported health status, and any targeted questions such as Cigarette Smoking Status or Long Term Care use.  Where appropriate, trends from previous years should be addressed.  An outline can be found in Appendix B.  

4.5 In the Award Year only, two focused studies designed to further analyze findings from the tabulated results; topics will be determined by the government and provided in such a way that the government will be able to replicate the process and presentation of results for independent analysis of other topics.  

Task 5: Disposal of databases provided by VHA

All VHA data will be returned to VHA or destroyed in accordance with VA Security procedures immediately upon completion of the contract.  The contractor is not to maintain any copies of VHA data after the contract has concluded.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Procure FIPS-Compliant Integrated Two-Way FM Radio MultipleChannel Communications System from Pegasus Radio Corp. dba Federal Radio 
<SOLNBR>ADM-14-0060
<RESPDATE>053014
<CONTACT>Jordan Pulaski, Phone 3014923647, Email jordan.pulaski@nrc.gov
<DESC>The NRC requires an integrated two-way FM radio multiple-channel communications system that will provide real-time communications capability throughout the NRC's White Flint Complex. This system must meet the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 encryption standards. This system will support of the execution of the NRC's COOP and OEP, as well as tactical guard force operations. Currently the NRC does not possess a two-way radio communications system or any type of communications system. The NRC currently utilizes a combination of cell phones, runners and communication through the guard force's antiquated short-range two-way FM radio system. During the August 23rd, 2011 earthquake the area cell phone networks went down, which significantly increased the time and effort required to gain accountability of staff members. The existing two-way FM radio system employed by the guard force is limited to short range line-of-sight transmissions and is lacking in its ability to assist with tactical communications. The guard force radio system is also severely limited inside buildings due to a lack of an integrated antennae and repeater system. <br />NRC is required by the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Office of Spectrum Management, to utilize a specialized mobile radio (SMR) system operated by Pegasus Radio Corp., doing business as Federal Radio. The Office of Spectrum Management manages the Federal Government Radio Frequency Spectrum. The Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management, January 2008 Edition - May 2011 Revision, states:
<p>"Trunked land-mobile radio systems may be established by an individual agency or cooperatively by several agencies. Innovative methods of using commercial entities to design and operate trunking systems under sponsorship of one or more Federal agencies are encouraged. Frequency assignments for shared trunked land-mobile radio communication systems shall be obtained by the installing, sponsoring or lead agency which is responsible for managing the system. Individual user agencies are not required to obtain frequency assignments to share the system if operated in accordance with provisions of Paragraph 4, Section 9.1.2."</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 of the aforementioned section states: "Individual user agencies are not required to submit applications to obtain frequency authority for stations operating in a trunked land-mobile radio system. The agency, or designated lead agency managing the system, will obtain authority for all stations that use the system."</p>
<p>Accordingly, NTIA is the sponsoring federal agency and Pegasus Radio Corp. dba Federal Radio is the commercial entity. Pegasus Radio Corp. dba Federal Radio is the only vendor licensed by Department of Commerce to use the Fed SMR system - this is a set of pre-approved frequencies for use by the Government. Therefore, federal government agencies and contractors located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area are required to use this source for those types of requirements.</p>
<p>Based on the above, intends to satisfy this procurement requirement through Pegasus Radio Corp. dba Federal Radio, 1202 Technology Drive Suite C, Aberdeen, Maryland 21001-1245. The authority for this sole source action is 41 U.S.C. &sect; 3304(a)(1), as implemented at FAR 6.302-1.</p>

<a href="mailto:catherine.e.johnangle.civ@mail.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>This is a synopsis notice for  the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) W15QKN-14-R-0067 (DRAFT RFP) for the M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, National Stock Number 1010-01-566-9083(M320 GL) and M320A1 40mm Grenade Launcher, National Stock Number 1010-01-557-2542 (M320 GL).  This announcement is issued for planning purposes only and constitutes a request for exchange of information pursuant to FAR 5.205 Special Situations (c) Special notices and FAR 15.201 Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals.  The purpose of exchanging information is to both improve the understanding of United States Government (USG) requirements by industry and knowledge of industry capabilities by the USG.  Potential offerors are directed to NOT submit proposals at this time. <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW), intends to award this requirement as a Single Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders.  The contract will include five ordering periods to cover FY15- FY19 United States Army (US Army) M320 GL requirements and supplemental requirements for Other Agencies.  As future needs for the M320 GL are identified during the life of the contract, FFP delivery orders will be awarded to the IDIQ base contract.  It is anticipated that delivery orders will generally be placed annually.  However, delivery orders may be placed more or less often to accommodate changing needs of the USG Department of Defense.  A minimum of 7,200 M320 GLs and a maximum of 32,413 M320 GLs will be included in the planned IDIQ contract. <br> The M320 GL is a 40mm, single shot, grenade launcher that can deliver aimed fire to area targets at a distance of up to 350 meters.  The M320 GL is capable of being utilized in both standalone and M4/M16 mounted configurations. The M320 GL module (M320 GLM) system consists of a grenade launcher, buttstock, leaf sight, M4/M16 mounting hardware, sling, Laser Range Finder (LRF) and Grenadier Sighting System (GSS), when a GSS configuration is determined and GSS are produced. The M320 GL features an aluminum side-pivoting barrel assembly, aluminum receiver, removable buttstock and mounting brackets, along with a polymer pistol grip/trigger guard assembly. The M320 GL will be produced to a USG M320 GL Technical Data Package (TDP).   <br>  <br> Any offeror(s) awarded a contract resulting from the formal RFP shall be required to conduct First Article Test(s) and  Lot Acceptance Test(s).  Awardees will be required to safely and securely store Government furnished rifles, carbines, grenade launchers, 5.56 and 40mm ammunition, and equipment to be considered for award and will have to receive a  quote mark complete award quote mark  rating from their cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) under pre-award surveys and be approved by the Defense Security Service to physical security level(s) designated for the weapons and ammunitions manufactured by the contractor or provided by the USG. <br> Potential Offerors are invited to submit questions and/or comments to DRAFT RFP prior to the release of a final RFP.  Offerors shall submit questions electronically no later than July 24, 2014, to Therese Grimm at therese.m.grimm.civ@mail.mil and Catherine John- Angle at catherine.e.johnangle.civ@mail.mil.  It is anticipated that interested parties questions submitted in response to this synopsis notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) along with corresponding USG answers. <br> Note:  No information exchanged with industry will be considered in the evaluation process.  The only time that an Offeror's information is evaluated for award will be during the pre-award evaluation phase(s) of proposals submitted under the final RFP W15QKN-14-R-0067.  Potential offerors are directed not to submit proposals at this time. <br>  <br> The USG has acquired the rights to use the TDP for competitive procurements under a negotiated Special License Agreement (SLA).  Therefore, this TDP is categorized as Distribution D and is restricted to the terms of the SLA. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  This restriction also applies to distribution of the TDP to all subcontractors at every level. When the planned draft RFP and the planned formal RFP are released, only respondents who have a completed and signed AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, Non-Disclosure Non-Use Agreement (NDA), to be executed by an authorized representative of the respondent's firm that respond to this notification or the notice for the final RFP, and DD Form 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement will be granted access to the TDP. Draft drawings will be available on or about June 15, 2014 and provided to a respondent after the respondent meets the requirements set forth in this Synopsis Notice.  At the conclusion of the Final RFP process and upon notification from the USG Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), all respondents in receipt of data covered under the NDA, except to an offeror that may be awarded a contract under the final RFP, will be required to complete the supplied Certificate of Destruction notifying the USG that all licensed data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed.  If an offeror is awarded a contract under the final RFP they will be required to complete the supplied Certificate of Destruction notifying the USG that all licensed data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed at the completion or termination of the contract. <br>  <br> Release of a Draft TDP presents the opportunity for industry to provide any comments or concerns identified within the Draft TDP. Specific items for thought are availability of TDP materials, familiarity of processes, and overall TDP completeness. Items which are unclear to industry can be addressed prior to final RFP release. This opportunity will aid in providing industry a more clear understanding of the TDP, along with solicitation requirements, prior to release of the final RFP.  <br>  <br> This is a special notice only and is for planning purposes only.   <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A FINAL RFP AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A FINAL RFP. <br>  <br> The points of contact for this action are: <br>  <br> Catherine Johnangle, Contract Specialist, Email: Catherine.e.johnangle.civ@mail.mil and <br> Therese Grimm, Contract Officer, Email: therese.m.grimm.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED. <br>  <br> The Government will accept written questions by Email to therese.m.grimm.civ@mail.mil and catherine.e.johnangle.civ@mail.mil. <br>

<DESC>NOTICE OF DECISION TO CONTRACT WITH A SINGLE-SOURCE:  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, intends to award a single-source contact modificaiton to Cessna Aircraft Corporation to extend contract DTFAAC-09-C-00003 for a base period of three (3) months with three (3) one-month options.

This procurement is considered to be single-source based on the requirement to continue services under the contract while a competitive solicition is being prepared.  On 26 February 2014, the FAA posted a notice on the FAA's Contracting Opportunities (FAACO) website with an intent to single-source a follow-on contract to Cessna Aircraft Corporation.  Subsequent to the posting of the notice, addition information was obtained which indicated additional sources may be available and capable of providing the required aircraft lease and maintenance services.  Based on this augmenting market information received, a determination was made to change the acquisition strategy from single-source to full and open competition.  However, since there is not adequate time to issue a competitive solicitation and award a new follow-on contract prior to the expiration date of the current contract, and since there is a critical need to continuously maintain the lease of aircraft for support of the Washington Flight Program, the current contract must be extended for a commensurate amount of time while a new competitive solicitation is issued and a new follow-on contract is awarded.

Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAAs decision to contract with a selected source via single-source procedures.

All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Randall L. Bratcher, at e-mail address randall.bratcher@faa.gov, or mailing address FAA, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Aviation, Medical & Training Division (AMQ-310), P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK  73125.

<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">NSWCPCD provides no reimbursement for the submittal of White Paper. White Papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria:</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">(1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">(2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC PCD specific mission areas</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">(3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC PCD programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC PCD with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">(4) Interested parties' capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">(5) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the planned Principal Investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the White Paper's objectives</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">(6) Realism of the projected cost and the availability of funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">The above criteria are listed in descending order of importance and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. NSWC PCD reserves the right to invite parties with the most promising White Papers to submit full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their White Paper. Any such invitation does not assure an offeror of subsequent funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities. It is important to notify potential offerors that each grant or cooperative agreement placed under this announcement to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award. If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.</span></p>

Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1, the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The period of performance will be for twelve months, beginning October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015, with an additional four options years, if exercised.
<p>"OccuBrowse" will be accessed through SSA's Digital Library. This resource is used for SSA disability hearing and adjudication purposes by the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review and the Office of Disability Programs. The subscription is also used as a resource to support the agency's Ticket to Work program. "OccuBrowse" includes electronic access to search and browse job-specific information. This subscription is unique because it provides cross-searching of vocational data from various sources, enabling SSA staff to retrieve information on a wide range of occupations to adjudicate disability claims. It contains the entire Dictionary of Occupational Titles, with all 12,760 descriptions, with the ability to:<br />&bull; Search job descriptions by a key word in the title, description, or both<br />&bull; Review job requirements for any occupation<br />&bull; Review national, state, and local employment projections<br />&bull; Review wage data for occupational categories<br />&bull; Identify schools that offer training related to an occupation<br />&bull; Identify industries most likely to hire for an occupation<br />&bull; Write Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-compliant job descriptions using the job analysis form and report<br />&bull; Find groups of similar occupations by title, interests, industries, aptitudes, skills, etc.<br />&bull; Access sophisticated web crawlers that catalog over 4.5 million open job orders</p>
<p>This requirement is utilizing procedures in FAR Part 12 in conjunction with procedures in FAR Part 13. A determination by SSA not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of SSA. Information received will be considered for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this notice. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. Responses shall be submitted by 12:00PM ET on June 6, 2014. If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement by June 6, 2014, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with SkillTRAN LLC as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. Respondents should refer to 0919-14-1020 in their responses.</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted via email to Molly.Papas@ssa.gov.</p>

In the absence of this information, the Contracting Officer will have no choice except to find your company "not responsible," a finding which will make you ineligible for award." <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC- Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>REGISTRATION OPEN for PUBLIC MEETING to Discuss: FAA Intent to Establish an Air Transportation Center of Excellence (COE) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) <br />Applications for registration to the Public Meeting to discuss the Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems will be accepted beginning April 18, 2014. The open period for registration will end on May 22, 2014 or until participant enrollment reaches room capacity, whichever comes first. The meeting is open to the public on a first come, first served basis by online registration only. To allow equal access for all Academic and Industry registrants, the maximum number of participants from each University or Organization is limited. Please coordinate from within your group before you start the registration application process. You will receive confirmation of your registration application within two business days for the public meeting. Application acceptance will include a link to the meeting venue that offers group rate lodging (including meals).<br />Through enabling Congressional legislation (Public Law 101-508), the FAA establishes partnerships with universities throughout the country to create the Air Transportation Centers of Excellence (COEs) in aviation research, education and training. These Centers form flexible, multi-disciplinary teams with other government organizations and industry affiliates. The team members coordinate research and development in areas of aviation technologies that are important to the agency's mission and long-term vision.<br />To enhance research efforts in this topic area, in March 2014, the FAA Administrator announced the intent to establish a COE for UAS which will serve to advance aerospace technology to meet the current and future needs of the U.S. UAS community. This effort is in support of the FAA's mission to ensure safety during the integration of UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS). The Office of Primary Interest (OPI) for the COE is the Research and Development Integration Division (ANG-C2).<br />The successful COE applicant shall be required to perform research to assist the FAA fill some gaps in its roadmap to integrate UA in the NAS. The FAA needs to identify and develop criteria and standards required for the civil certification of UAS pilots, equipment and operations. Seven focus research areas have been identified that represent examples of the challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve safe, efficient, and timely UAS integration in the NAS.<br />The identified Research Areas are: <br />Air Traffic Control Interoperability <br />Airport Ground Operations <br />Control and Communication <br />Detect and Avoid (DAA) <br />Human Factors <br />Spectrum Management (Updated April 8, 2014) <br />Unmanned Aircraft (UA) Pilot Training and Pilot Certification Including Other UA Crewmembers<br />To begin the Registration process, visit: https://faa-uas-coe.net/ <br />Click on either "REGISTER FOR PUBLIC MEETING 2014" in the upper right-hand corner of the home page, or select the "PUBLIC MEETING" tab under the banner.<br />For FAA COE Program specific legislative requirements, visit the COE Program website: <br />www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/management/coe/<br />The FAA looks forward to your attendance and participation.<br />Kind Regards,<br />Patricia Watts, National Program Director<br />FAA Centers of Excellence
<p>In accordance with Public Law 101-508, the FAA plans to competitively select a Center of Excellence for UAS within the next year. The COE will be a geographically disbursed consortium of the FAA, university partners and their affiliates selected by the FAA Administrator to conduct UAS related research, education and training while working jointly on issues of mutual interest and concern. The FAA will initially issue cooperative agreements to the selected university team members and specific projects will be defined and funded through matching grants over the life of the COE. In accordance with Public Law 101-508, the COE is responsible for matching all funds granted to establish, operate and conduct related research, and may contract with others as appropriate. Following the COE competitive process, the FAA sponsor may also generate requirements that would be supported through contract tasks awarded by the FAA to the COE member universities for FAA purpose.<br />SELECTION CRITERIA: The FAA Administrator will select the COE team on the ability of the applicant to meet the following criteria mandated by Congress:<br />--The extent to which the needs of the State in which the applicant is located are representative of the needs of the region for improved air transportation services and facilities.<br />--The demonstrated research and extension resources available to the applicant for carrying out the intent of the legislation.<br />--The capability of the applicant to provide leadership in making national and regional contributions to the solution of both long-range and immediate air transportation problems.<br />--The extent to which the applicant has an established air transportation program.<br />--The demonstrated ability of the applicant to disseminate results of air transportation research and educational programs through a statewide or region-wide continuing education program.<br />--The research projects that the applicant proposes to carry out under the grant.<br />Please Note:<br />&bull; All criteria are weighted equally.<br />&bull; A page limit will be specified in the Draft and Final Solicitations.<br />&bull; The actual projects supported through the COE will be defined and further evaluated following selection of the COE members. A research agenda will be developed during the first year of operation, and additional topic related tasks will be funded throughout the life of the Center.<br />RESEARCH AREAS: The FAA intends for the Center members to support a broad range of research areas. Topics will include, but will not be limited to, the following:<br />1. Air Traffic Control Interoperability<br />2. Airport Ground Operations <br />3. Control and Communication<br />4. Detect and Avoid (DAA)<br />5. Human Factors<br />6. Spectrum Management<br />7. Unmanned Aircraft Pilot Training and Pilot Certification Including Other <br />UA Crew Members.<br />The FAA anticipates the COE will attract organizations such as industrial groups and other public and private entities interested in collaborating with and coordinating the research and related activities that will generate solutions to immediate and long-term UAS related issues. These organizations may be considered as affiliate members by the COE core universities and may provide matching contributions and receive funding from the COE.<br />The FAA will issue a Draft Solicitation, allow for a period of public comment, and discuss the COE and UAS technical requirements at a public meeting that will be conducted in the Washington, DC area in May. For additional UAS information and public meeting registration details, visit the COE UAS website: https://faa-uas-coe.net.<br />This meeting is a condition of the procurement process and potential applicants are encouraged but are not required to attend. Registration prior to the meeting, however, will be mandatory. <br />Contact: Patricia.Watts@FAA.Gov to be placed on the COE mailing list for future COE notifications or for COE Program specific questions.<br />AWARD DATE: The FAA Administrator expects to announce the final selection of the COE for UAS core team within the next year.<br />Issued in Atlantic County, New Jersey on April 17, 2014.<br />Grants Office Address: <br />FAA Centers of Excellence Program Office<br />Atlantic City International Airport<br />Atlantic City, New Jersey 08405 <br />Place of Performance: <br />Wm.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause.

(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor?s obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

The solicitation number is FDA-14-223-SOL-1131336 and this solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-73 effective April 29, 2014.<br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541711- Research and Development in Biotechnology; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.

<p>Contract Type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. <br />Part I: General Information (Introduction/Background/Scope)<br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requires miRNA Sequencing Validation and Confirmation Services for profiles and expressions of miRNAs specific to carcinogen exposure, for use in identifying carcinogens biomarkers.</p>
<p>Recent studies demonstrate that miRNAs play an important role in chemical carcinogenesis and are involved in the early stage of tumor development, suggesting that miRNAs could be useful biomarkers for the detection of potential carcinogens. Our previous studies show that there are changes in expression for a large number of miRNAs following carcinogen exposure and that these expression changes occur in tissue and chemical specific manners. Many of the miRNAs deregulated by carcinogens are involved in the regulation of genes that are important for the key pathways of chemical carcinogenesis, including xenobiotic metabolism, DNA repair, apoptosis, cell proliferation, tumor suppression, cell transformation, and tumor progression. <br />The previous aforementioned studies generated miRNA sequenced data using an Illumina Hi Sequencing Platform. To ensure future data is scientifically comparable with data from the previous studies, identical platforms across studies are necessary to the integrity of the sequencing quality, as well as the downstream analysis.<br />The resulting miRNA data will be utilized to evaluate miRNA profiles and changes in miRNA expression following carcinogen exposure, thereby resulting in potential biomarkers for identifying carcoinogens.</p>
<p><br />Part II: Work Requirements<br /><br />A. Technical Requirements</p>
<p>At a minimum the Contractor shall provide:<br />I. Library Construction<br />&bull; The library preparation shall be processed in a batch of 48 samples per run, using 48 indexed adaptors. <br />&bull; Each sample shall be processed individually by adding special bar-coded adaptors and reverse transcript and amplified. <br />&bull; Samples shall be pooled by mixing equal amount of DNA from each library based on the concentration measured by Picogreen. <br />&bull; miRNA library pools recovered from the samples shall yield a minimum of 20ng <br />&bull; The quantity of each library shall be measured by Picogreen DNA quantification, and the quality of library shall be recorded using high sensitive DNA chips on a bioanalyzer.</p>
<p>II. miRNA Sequencing<br />&bull; The barcoded libraries shall be sequenced utilizing the Illumina HiSeq2500 or above platform for single end 50 base pair reads. <br />&bull; Each pool of 48 different barcoded samples shall be evenly uploaded onto 4 flowcell lanes.</p>
<p>III. Data Collection, Management, Analysis and Processing (CMAP) <br />&bull; The sequencing data shall be de-multiplexed and transformed to FASTQ format data files (FASTQ files are ASCII text files that encode both nucleotide calls as well as 'quality information', which provides information about the confidence of each nucleotide). The final reads passed filter shall be no less than 10 million reads for each sample. <br />&bull; The Contractor shall upload all sequence data onto a secure data server and make the data available for download by FDA investigators. The provided data shall be in FASTQ data files format, and shall be able to offer an alternative method of data transformation upon request by the Government.</p>

<p>Solicitation Provisions</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (July 2013) applies to this solicitation. The following addenda apply:</p>
<p>The period of performance for the option periods in any resultant award will be estimated based on the date of award, estimated ultimate delivery of Item No. 0001. If/when Option Period One is exercised, the periods of performance for all options will be firmed via bilateral modification. <br />The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation.<br /><br />The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as<br />follows:</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>(i) Technical Capability <br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price (inclusive of options)</p>
<p>When combined, technical capability, and past performance are more important than price in determining the best value to the Government. If the Government determines non-price factors to be essentially equal, price becomes more important as the discriminating factor.<br />Technical Capability</p>
<p>Technical capability will be determined by review of information submitted by the offeror demonstrating corporate ability and experience in conducting miRNA sequencing by describing instrumentation, expertise with that instrumentation and operational integrity of the required instrumentation to conduct the proposed miRNA sequencing, RNA extraction, library preparation, and MicroRNA Deep Sequencing services. Describe in detail the existing facility and equipment that will be dedicated to successful performance of the required services identified above. Address the professional qualifications and experience of key staff who may be assigned in the production of the materials and delivery of services. Discuss specific software that will be used in data acquisition, statistics, quality control, data storage and archiving.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. <br />(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. <br />(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. <br />(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. <br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. <br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. <br />(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- <br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or <br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or <br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. <br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. <br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. <br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. <br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

<DESC>In many experiments on metals, nanomaterials, composites etc, being carried out by researchers and students at NPS (specifically in MAE and Physics) samples for analysis require analysis by x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques for assessing the identity of the phases, their crystal structure, lattice constants, crystallite size and strain. This equipment is heavily used in MS2201, MS3202 and MS4312 (as well as the solid state physics classes offered by Physics Department) in their laboratory courses. Many MAE and Physics students routinely use XRD as one of the materials characterization techniques in their research work for their thesis projects. The equipment currently in use (PANalytical XRD).
 MAE were purchased several years ago (before 1995) and is obsolete and even the manufacturer is unable to provide parts and the electronics have changed tremendously. The current PANalytical XRD was down for several months due to the difficulty of obtaining proper parts.  The procurement of a new, desktop x-ray diffractometer will allow for our laboratory courses and student thesis research to be fully supported. 

PLEASE SEE THE RFQ FOR THE LIST OF REQUIREMENTS.

Offerors questions shall be submitted no later than 5:00 PM PST 02 June 2014, the government will provide a response no later than 06 June 2014, and the proposal shall be submitted no later than 5:00 PM PST 11 June 2014 and shall be valid for 60 days.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

SECTION E - SOLICITATION PROVISIONS
E.1  52.212-2  EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
  (a) The Government shall evaluate proposals based on the lowest priced, responsible, technically acceptable offer.  The Offeror's technical capability shall be evaluated in accordance with salient characteristics (Section B).  All relevant facts and circumstances gathered from sources of information available to the Government (e.g., National Institutes of Health [NIH] Contractor Performance System [CPS] and Past Performance Information Retrieval System [PPIRS]) will be used as part of determining the responsibility of prospective suppliers. If an Offeror has not commented on negative past performance evaluations obtained by the Technical Evaluation Board, the Offeror may be given the opportunity to explain and/or mitigate adverse past performance during verbal or written interactions after receipt of proposals. Offerors who do not have relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (neither favorable nor unfavorable). 
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Question &amp; Answers: Abar Furnace 30 Apr 14 #1-6
<p>1. What exactly do they want for an auto tune screen? When the original contractor was training our maintenance for the tuning the process was cumbersome and the contractor suggested making a screen that would make this easier being all in one screen.</p>
<p>2. The Honeywell 900 has an auto tune function built in. True but as stated the process is cumbersome to do and the maintenance wanted an easier way to do this.</p>
<p>3. What do they want this screen to do or show, a trend of all the TC's used in a uniformity survey? They need to be able to program offsets during ramping of temperatures so it does not over shoot at any point during the program.</p>
<p>4. Do you want this listed as a profile to access. You would have two recipes, this would be number 3. It could be called auto tune. It would be run just as any other profile you would run. If having a profile that is similar to a recipe that will help the maintenance people tune the furnace, then yes. 4a. What do you to see on the screen??? No info to provide.</p>
<p>5. How many zones of temperature control are there? There are three heat zones controlled individually and adjustable individually.</p>
<p>6. Does the furnace now trend all TC's for a survey during a run or are there only a zone TC, and an overtemp? They are trending all of them which include TC's in the chamber for control and over temp and well as a TC in the foreline.</p>

<p>There were a few questions that were asked regarding this solicitation. The questions were forwarded to the engineer and he provided his response. Questions and responses are listed below. Also, the due date for offers is extended to 5 June 2014, 2 pm EDT.</p>
<p>1. Ref 4.7 Power - Are you OK with a submitted solution which is "either/or" rather than switchable with respect to power supply voltage and current combination?</p>
<p>Response: The "either-or" solution is fine.</p>
<p>2. Ref 4.2 Multiple Test Probes - Please clarify the requirement that the bath "shall be capable of holding at least four test instrument probes or glass thermometers plus a standard external reference probe simultaneously while maintaining the test temperature and temperature stability stated above. " Do you require a specialized mounting/holding kit or just enough size/capacity to insert all those probes?</p>
<p>Response: Bath must have the capacity for the probes, but no special holding device was mentioned in the Purchase Description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Ref 3.3 Fluid Media - What fluids do you want supplied with the baths? Three fluids are typically used for this range of temperature. If we must include fluids, please define what fluids are needed and what range of temperatures must be covered by the fluids. The one that covers high temps ~ 300C is especially expensive. Many times the baths are not used through the entire range, if this is known, it can help with Fluid selection.</p>
<p>Response: Bath is expected to come with fluids needed to cover the stated temperature range.</p>

Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as "No Charge" by entering "NC" in the unit price. <br />c.

In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Extreme care and attention should be given to ensure that all necessary items are included in the proposal.   <br>    <br>  L.1.1 CLAUSE FILL-INS:   Some clauses require the offeror to fill in information. Pay particular attention to 52.247-60 GUARANTEED SHIPPING CHARACTERISTICS and 52.246-4028 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE POINTS: ORIGIN as that information will be used by the Government to calculate transportation costs.  A completed copy of clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, must be included with your proposal.  <br>    <br>  L.2 TECHNICAL INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE (TIQ):  The offeror shall complete each section of the TIQ (Attachments 002, 004 and 006).  Failure to complete every section of the TIQ may render your offer ineligible for award.   <br>    <br>  L.2.1 ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL CAPABILITY INFORMATION: In addition to completing the TIQs, the offeror shall support its responses by electronically submitting supporting documentation where indicated on the TIQ.    <br>    <br>  L.3 CLIN STRUCTURE and PRICE INFORMATION: The offeror shall legibly fill-in, in U.S. Dollars, the Unit Price column and the total Amount column for all CLIN numbers 0001AA - 0003AA on Attachment 007.  <br>    <br>  SECTION-M EVALUATION:  <br>    <br>  M.1 BASIS Of AWARD:  The Government will award a single Firm-Fixed-Price contract for Pickup Trucks, Sport Utility Vehicles and 8-Passenger Van to the responsible offeror that is assessed as Acceptable in the Technical Capability Factor with the Lowest Total Evaluated Price.   <br>    <br>  M.1.2 EVALUATION:  The evaluation will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.6 ( quote mark Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items quote mark ).  There are two factors:  (1) Price and (2) Technical Capability.  The Government intends to conduct a price evaluation, to include transportation costs, on all proposals.  The Government will then conduct a technical capability review of the lowest total evaluated price proposal.  If the lowest price proposal is determined to be Unacceptable, then the Government will conduct a technical capability review on the next lowest price proposal.  Unless the Government determines it is in its best interests to conduct discussions, the Government will follow this process until the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal is identified.       <br>    <br>  M.1.3 TECHNICAL CAPABILITY FACTOR:  For an offeror to be eligible for award, its proposal must be assessed as Acceptable under each section of the Technical Information Questionnaire (TIQ) (Attachments 002, 004 and 006).  Offerors found to be Unacceptable under any section of the TIQ will not be considered for award.  To determine Acceptability,   <br>    <br>  (1)	the Offeror's response must indicate it can meet each requirement on the TIQ; and  <br>    <br>  (2)	where supporting documentation is required, the Government will review the information submitted to confirm that the Offeror is capable of meeting the requirement.   <br>    <br>  An Acceptable proposal is one which clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  An Unacceptable proposal is one which does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.   <br>    <br>  M.1.4 PRICE FACTOR:  The information submitted in response to Section L.3 will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of the offeror's total evaluated price.  A price is considered reasonable if it does not exceed what would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.    The total evaluated price will consist of the total sum of all CLIN numbers 0001AA - 0003AA and the transportation costs as determined by the ACC-Warren Transportation Office for all FOB origin CLINs (base only).  <br>    <br>  M.1.5 DISCUSSIONS:  In accordance with FAR clause 52.212-1(g), the Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical capability standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  In addition, the Government reserves the right, without entering discussions, to request additional information necessary to support the offeror's price in order to determine price reasonableness.  <br>    <br>  Offers are due no later than 30 June 2014, 1600 local time Warren, MI. Quotations must be submitted via email to darryl.c.eddings.civ@mail.mil.     <br>    <br>    <br>                       <br>                   <br>

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">In accordance with the 2012 NIH Master Plan, the two (2) buildings are to be demolished to make space for a new research building.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'"> The current NIH Master Plan calls for the demolition of Buildings 7 &amp; 9 as part of the plan to clear the Southeast portion of the site closest to Building 10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The site will be used for the new Research Facility (Building D).

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.3, NIH will employ source selection tradeoff procedures to procure and award the construction contract for this project. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly greater than cost or price. This is a Two Phase Design Build Selection Procedure in accordance with FAR 36.303-1(b). The selection process will have two phases. Phase I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), shall result in the establishment of a list of offerors identified as Viable Competitors, who will be invited to participate in the next stage of the procurement, Phase II. Phase II, Request for Proposals (RFP), shall result in the selection of the construction contractor whose offer provides the Government with the best value. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">In Phase I, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that are critical to this procurement and that will serve as the basis for the determination of the viable competitors. Interested offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each offeror in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the RFP or, based on the information submitted in the RFQ response that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding this advice, an offeror that is unlikely to be a viable competitor may not participate in Phase II of the procurement. Offerors that did not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase I will not be allowed to participate in Phase II of the procurement. After evaluating Phase I proposals, the Government shall select the most highly qualified offerors, not to exceed three (3).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">In Phase II, the Government will issue the RFP to the viable competitors and the other offerors from Phase I that elect to participate in Phase II. The RFP will serve as the basis for the firm-fixed price offers from the offerors in Phase II. The firm-fixed price offers will be due by the date established in the RFP. Based on the Phase I and Phase II submissions, the Government shall select the offer that reflects the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase I and Phase II offers without discussions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Any resulting contract will be firm fixed price. NAICS Code: 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million. It has been determined that competition will be limited to eligible 8(a) firms located within the geographical area serviced by the Washington DC Metropolitan District Office, and other eligible 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide place of business located within the geographical competitive area per 13 CFR &sect;124.507. All other 8(a) participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Magnitude of Construction is between $1 million and $5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">All responders are advised that this project may be cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and final award. All contractors are advised that they must be registered, by the time of Phase 1 submissions, in SAM's database (https://www.sam.gov). Joint ventures must also be registered into this database as a joint venture. We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure this registration is in place should they be selected for the award. Lack of registration in the SAM's database will make an offeror ineligible for award.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The procurement is an 8(a) competitive set aside for the local area of Metropolitan Washington DC District Office of the Small Business Administration per FAR 19.804-3(d). </span></p>

Offerors must include a statement in their offer that they acknowledge this RFQ Amendment #2.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Amendment #1 is to extend the quote submission deadline [see section highlighted in yellow].

Another amendment will be issued with the answers to those questions. Offerors must include a statement in their offer that they acknowledge this RFQ Amendment #1.</p>
<p>General Overview:</p>
<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD, has a requirement for various animal serological parasitology tests.</p>
<p>The USU is the only Federal health sciences university and we are committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>Minimum Specifications:</p>
<p>USU will collect, package, and ship the necessary samples for testing as need arises. We possess the capability to collect the samples in either serum or dried blood spot format.</p>

For this reason, we intend to include the winning bidder's entire animal serology catalog in this BPA. Interested vendors must provide an Excel spreadsheet of their complete animal serology catalog. This Excel spreadsheet must include the itemized, proposed prices.</p>

The M136A1 will provide the U.S. Army with the capability to defeat medium (e.g. BMP-3) armored targets encountered in urban combat environments. The capability of the M136A1 to be safely fired from confined (or enclosed) spaces will provide field Commanders and Warfighters with an effective capability that will increase mobility, flexibility in the application of force and lethality by significantly increasing engagement locations while limiting exposure to gunners.

<DESC>A provision of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, authorizes non competitive contracts to be performed by only one or a limited number of sources via 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1); Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) &sect; 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii) (A) and (B). As such, for the purposes described hereunder and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) authority of Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, coupled with the Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District intends to execute, without competition, a bilateral Contract Modification under Contract W912P6-13-C-0014 (Modification P00002). The incumbent Contractor is JOHN KENO AND COMPANY; the address for this organization is 8608 W. Catalpa Avenue, Suite 808, Chicago, Illinois 60656-1116 with Company Cage Code No. "1FTU3." The resulting modification will implement new Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) with a permit (IDNR) dictated quantity of 12,170 CY of properly grade sand for Beach Nourishment with permit (IDNR) driven for the Rosewood Park Beach GLFER project. The provisions of the CLINS will be required to coordinate final beach grades with the permanent boardwalk and miscellaneous structures currently under construction.
<p><br />The resulting modification will increase the sand placed at the Rosewood Park Beach GLFER project site required to supply and properly grade sand in conformance with specification section 31 00 00 for Beach Nourishment as required by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) permit no. LM2014003. The permit requires a surplus volume of 20% over and above the volume indicated in the base contract documents. The distribution of sand per the IDNR permit shall be as follows:<br />1. Pre-Fill Updrift beach add 1,800 CY <br />2. North Beach Cell add 1,440 CY <br />3. Middle Beach Cell add 1,760 CY <br />4. South beach Cell add 5,800 CY</p>
<p><br />The resulting modification will increase sand placed at the project site required to supply and properly grade sand in conformance with specification section 31 00 00 for Beach Nourishment an additional 1,370 CY beyond the aforementioned IDNR permit required surplus sand. This volume of sand is required to coordinate final beach grades with the permanent boardwalk and miscellaneous structures currently under construction by the Local Sponsor under separate contract.</p>
<p>The total amount of additional sand to be placed at the site is 12,170 CY.</p>
<p>John Keno and Company, Inc., the incumbent Contractor, possesses an extensive breadth of capabilities with constructing breakwaters and other project features; knowledge and experience with the Rosewood Beach site and associated constraints; and has established a broad communication system for coordination.</p>
<p>The original contract was competitively solicited and awarded based upon a "final determination" letter issued by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) dated 30 August 2013. Subsequent to the award, IDNR issued the permit authorizing work in the lake and on the beach. The permit required a surplus volume of sand for Beach Nourishment. This volume is in excess of the beach storage potential capacity as specified in the "Guidelines for the Submittal of Applications for Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources Permits for Shore Protection Projects in Lake Michigan". As such, this volume was not anticipated in the original design documents. The Local Sponsor has awarded a separate contract for work which is directly adjacent to and interdependent upon the work of this contract. The success of both contracts depends upon close coordination between both Prime contractors, the Local Sponsor and the Government. The Local Sponsor has closed the beach for public use for the entire 2014 season and notified the local residents. All construction and beach nourishment work has been carefully scheduled to complete during this construction season. This unanticipated addition must be immediately incorporated into the combined schedules of both current contracts.</p>
<p>The sequence of activities requires the sand be delivered prior to the completion of the new parking lot and the boardwalk and other structures. Sand delivery vehicles would damage the pervious concrete parking lot and off loading would be blocked by the boardwalk and other structures. A delayed delivery of sand would require extraordinary means and methods for placement and would impose a substantial additional cost to the Government.</p>
<p>The relatively short and narrow beach property causes major site constraints. The site would be required to host three prime contractors, each with their own subcontractors, tradesmen, heavy equipment and multiple material deliveries. This creates a substantial hazard to the safety of all workers on site and the public at large and would require an unreasonable level of legal, scheduling and scope coordination between the three prime contractors, their subcontractors, the Local Sponsor and the Government.</p>
<p>It would not be reasonable to expect that all the work could be coordinated and completed under the condition of three prime contractors within the current construction season. The resulting delay represents additional costs to both the Government and the Local Sponsor, as well as hardship to the public from an extended beach shut down.</p>
<p>Therefore, this contractual requirement is only obtainable form a single source, the incumbent Contractor.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this notice is to publicize this contract action prior to contract modification, as mandated in FAR Subpart 5.2 (Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions) and FAR Subpart 6.3 (Other Than Full and Open Competition). The contract type will remain Firm-Fixed Price Construction and the period of performance will&nbsp;be extended an additional 42 days.</p>
<p>This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal.</p>

<DESC> <br>  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District intends (USACE) to negotiate and award a Firm Fixed Priced follow-on sole source contract with Paul Ely.   The Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) currently has no grid-based routing scheme to simulate overland flow and surface soil erosion. This follow on work will provide for the addition of a new 2-D diffusion wave surface routing method and the addition of a grid-based surface soil erosion method to HEC-HMS.  The grid-based surface soil erosion capability will be based on the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM).  The grid-based erosion model requires commensurate surface hydrology capable of calculating the shear stress within each grid cell.  The existing ModClark transform method, while grid-based, is only quasi-distributed and cannot compute shear stress.  In order to support the development of the new erosion method, a new transform method will be created that can provide the required surface hydraulic information.  The new transform method will be based on the 2-D Diffusion Wave Routing method used in the HEC-RAS 2-D solver engine.  The previous work effort converted the RHEM source code to the Java language and implemented it as a beta version of RHEM in HEC-HMS.  The RHEM code will now be modified to work with the new 2-D Diffusion Wave Routing method.  <br>    <br>  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541511 - Applications software programming services, custom computer, which has a size standard of Size Standard: $25,500,000.00 in annual receipts is applicable.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	23 Christopher Way
     	Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
      	      
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Delivery Order (DO) for brand name Axiomatics Software Maintenance Support as well as the procurement of additional Axiomatics Software Subscriptions including including two Policy Server production licenses, four non-production licenses, one Reverse Query non-production license, two Policy Auditor licenses and software maintenance support.     The proposed effort will be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurements (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).  The period of performance (PoP) for the software maintenance support shall be 12 months from date of award.  Furthermore, there will be three 12-month option periods for continued software maintenance support.  Delivery of the additional Axiomatics Software Subscriptions including two Policy Server production licenses, four non-production licenses shall occur  within 30 days of receipt and processing of the DO.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is for for brand name Axiomatics Software Maintenance Support as well as the procurement of additional Axiomatics Software Subscriptions including two Policy Server production licenses, four non-production licenses, one Reverse Query non-production license, two Policy Auditor licenses and software maintenance support. The additional licenses allow VA to meet growing capacity demands as the number of consuming applications continues to increase, resulting in an ever growing Veteran population requiring authorization to access these applications. 

The Axiomatics tool suite provides a centralized capability to satisfy the specific requirements of the Specialized Access Control (SAC) service such as attribute and rule based access control by supporting policy creation, maintenance, decision, and enforcement functionality.  SAC provides a centralized, fine-grained authorization capability furnishing enterprise applications with the ability to externalize authorization and related audit functionality from the application logic.  It offers a greater and more granular degree of control on both access rights and the information that is being protected.  It is based on the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) 3.0 standards. 
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized".

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph eight of this document, it was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for this brand name item and associated services.  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  In 2013, VA procured the original Axiomatics software licenses based on a brand name or equivalent basis, to provide SAC solutions to VA.  Subsequently, the entire SAC system has been developed using Axiomatics as a foundational component.  Only Axiomatics or its resellers have access to Axiomatics' proprietary software maintenance support.  Therefore the brand name or equivalent approach was not followed for this action.  Without the renewal of the Axiomatics software maintenance support services for the existing licenses VA will not be able to receive critical software updates, enhancements, software corrections, and technical support; posing an immediate risk to VA's Authentication and Authorization capabilities.  A failure of the Axiomatics Tool Suite could render VA applications, systems, and data inaccessible to authorized users; potentially compromising Veterans safety.  Conversely, a system failure increases the potential for unauthorized users to access these same systems, putting at risk all data, including Personal Health Information (PHI) and Personal Identifiable Information (PII).

As the number of consuming applications, and by extension, the number of end users increases exponentially, investments in additional capacity are critical to meet that demand.  Since the Axiomatics software is proprietary, third parties cannot simply provide patches that alter the ability of the software to allow for increased volume.  In regards to scaling horizontally, the purchase of additional Policy Decision Points (PDP) and associated licenses from a vendor other than Axiomatics or its resellers would effectively complicate SAC by making it a multi-vendor offering.  Utilizing any other brand name would result in interoperability and compatibility issues with the currently fielded Axiomatics software.  Specifically, this is the only product that can meet all of  VA's functional requirements, for example allowing authorized users access to both required data and various VA applications which currently only work with policies developed with Axiomatics software.  Note: A policy is a rule or set of rules that provide authorization to an end user to access a system/application.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  It was determined however that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for this brand name item.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available.

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name item, there are several authorized resellers of the Axiomatics products on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  Limited competition for this requirement among these vendors is anticipated.  Finally, in order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered. 

8.  Market Research:  Market research was initially conducted in December 2013 by the Government's technical experts to ascertain the ability of any  source other than an Axiomatics reseller that can provide the aforementioned services.  They confirmed that the software currently contains proprietary information and only Axiomatics and its resellers can provide the necessary software maintenance support and software subcriptions.  While other sources possess general capabilities needed to provide similar services, no other source was found to meet VA's needs without access to the Axiomatics proprietary data.  The Government's technical experts updated their market research in April of 2014 by researching other similar brand name items. Specifically the Government reviewed software from Oracle (Oracle Entitlements Server) and IBM (IBM Tivoli Security Policy Manager) however these companies' items could not operate in the current environment due to the interoperability and compatibility issues previously discussed in paragraph five of this document.  Furthermore, given that the Axiomatics product is a proprietary solution, there are no other authorized vendors that can provide maintenance licenses without voiding the licenses currently in use.  Additional market research was conducted by utilizing the Manufacturer Look up tool on the NASA SEWP website.  This search revealed that there are two authorized Axiomatics resellers; zero in Group A Value Added Resellers (VARs), one in Group B Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business VARs, one in Group C Small Business VARs, and zero in Group D Large Business VARs.
