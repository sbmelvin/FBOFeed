<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>The work to be performed will be to provide a receiver aircraft and pilot with probe/drogue air refueling capability. The effort will entail multiple sorties to evaluate the Variable Speed Drogue (VSD) flight characteristics prior, during and after dry aerial refueling at various contact closure rates.

The contractor shall provide at minimum a 2 seat aircraft with sufficient room in the cockpit for the second crew member to operate photo/test equipment. The receiver aircraft should be able to have government data gathering equipment installed or able to accommodate data gathering equipment to be brought onto the aircraft. Such instrumentation shall be approved by the contractor and the USAF. The contractor shall provide a functional MA-2 flexible tip probe equipped aircraft that is physically compatible with the prototype VSD(s) attached to a MA-2, MA-3 or a MA-3-1 coupling. The VSD(s) are approximately 50 inches in diameter and 25 inches in depth(measured from the coupling latch point to the center of the perpendicular plane across the trailing edge of the drogue). The Aircraft shall support VSD testing throughout the CV-22 refueling envelope (150-210 KEAS) at altitudes from 3000-20000 ft MSL. The contractor shall also provide highly qualified pilots current in aerial refueling, and necessary ground support to complete a surrogate receiver test effort. For purposes of this contract, aerial refueling currency is defined as "at least one probe/drogue receiver contact within the 90 day period prior to the first scheduled receiver test sortie."

<p>FAR 13-106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers - The Government intends to evaluate quotes in response to this quotation and will award one firm-fixed price contract using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. The following two (2) non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Factor 1 - Technical capability and Factor 2 - Past Performance. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis. If a proposal has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror's past performance history is satisfactory. An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then that its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical capability - The minimum criteria for acceptably for this factor shall be the submission of information that clearly indicates that the contractor is certified in the repair of Raymond equipment, and able to obtain the software and parts needed to repair the equipment.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance - By past performance the Government means the offeror's record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries. Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance. In evaluating an offeror's past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror's proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information. The information provided should reflect similar contracts for the same or similar type products</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to HighRes Biosolutions, 299 Washington Street, Suite 56, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801-2795 to procure a Steristore Incubator.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The mission of the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. NCGC optimizes biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; performs automated high-throughput screening (HTS); and performs chemistry optimization on confirmed hits to produce chemical probes for dissemination to the research community. This purchase request is to replace an existing incubator located in the laboratory that is experiencing reliability and functional problems. 

The HighRes Biosolutions (HRB) Robot is NCGCs biosafety level 2 screening system that is designed to safely run assays that involve the use of viruses or bacteria.  

The HRB Robot typically processes 200 to 400 assay plates and as many as 200 chemical compound plates in a programmed run.  Incubators are an important part of the robot system designed to keep assay microplates in an environment required to promote the growth of cells, usually involving a specific temperature, high humidity and a controlled amount of CO2.  A programmed assay run can last several days, usually requiring the robot to operate unattended for several days and nights.  When the robot is operating unattended and encounters an error, the system and its programmed operation will stop, it will send out an e-mail to the operator that operator intervention is required.  Incubator plate handling errors on the HRB Robot, have been responsible for the loss of many screening runs, resulting in a great loss of time and cost of materials to NCGC.  The existing robotic system that is being used in the laboratory is designed for use with infectious agents, between assay runs the incubators need to be decontaminated.  The Incubators do not have an internal self sterilizing capability, so caustic cleaning solutions must be used that also cause problems with the internal lift mechanism. That is why it is imperative to purchase a Steristore Incubator from HighRes Biosolutions. The Steristore is also compatible to existing HighRes Biosolutions Robots being used at NCGC.  
 
The Steristore is a larger capacity incubator that has the assay plate lift mechanism on the outside of the incubator to isolate it from the internal environment of the incubator.  Decontamination of the incubator is accomplished by a self cleaning automatic internal heater that heats the inside of the incubator to 180C.  The Steristore has 462 assay microplates, dual transfer nests that double the transfer speed of assay microplates in and out of the Steristore incubator.  Additionally, Steristore has assay plate barcode reading and inventory control, in which, this capability is not available on our current Incubators. SteriStore is insulated with aerogel (also known as frozen smoke), the lowest-density solid known. Aerogel is also listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the best insulator known to man. Comprised of air pores trapped in a dendritic microstructure, aerogel virtually blocks all three forms of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. And dual sets of automated doors minimize exposure of the internal chamber to the environment. 

This is a small business set-aside. Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339999, All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing, with size standard of 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-48 (January 31, 2011). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by March 16, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement,  referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-121-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.  Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition process to Sellstorm Manufacturing Co., 1 Sellstrom Drive, Palatine, IL 60067-6260.  The purchase is for :  
1.  Four (4) Ladder extension bars P/N 9200-SLERA316N;  
2. Four (4) extension assy P/N 9200-SLERE316N;  
3.  Two (2) sleeves P/N 2000-DEVN; 
 4. Twenty-eight (28) 6 HHCS for 4 inch Offset P/N 9200-SO96006H.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) Fleet Support Branch has been tasked by NAVSEA to outfit Navy Ships with fall protection equipment to be used when climbing machinery space escape trunks for firefighting purposes.
   NAVSEA requires the Fall Protection System to be comprised totally of Commercially Available Items (COTS) and meet all applicable commercial standards and regulations.   After a two year evaluation headed by NAVSEA, it was concluded that a flat rail carrier sleeve system proved to be the most reliable, safest, and easiest to use.  Also there were commercial standards for this type of system.

This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.   The U.S. Navy has been outfitting U.S. Navy ships with ladder safety system (LSS) Kits A and B manufactured by Sellstrom Manufacturing since fiscal year 2008.   The LSS kits, when installed, may also require additional parts depending upon the ships configuration.
   Sellstrom is the only company that manufactures this equipment that is compatible with LSS Kits A and B.    Delivery will be to Naval Support Activity, 110 Vernon Ave., Panama City Beach, FL 32408.  NAICS Code  332323  FSC:  2090   SBA size standard is 500 employees.  Award will be based on a responsive proposal at a fair and reasonable price.  A fixed price award is anticipated by March 25, 2011.  Questions can be addressed to sharon.hess@navy.mil.

<a href="mailto:newsome.otelia@epa.gov">OTELIA D. NEWSOME</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for Support for the Metals, Minerals, and Energy Sector.   With the finalization of the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy in July of 1999, the EPA introduced and outlined its ?risk-based? air toxics program, which includes both regulatory and non-regulatory programs and actions.  In addition, the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy lists the goals of the EPA?s air toxics program, which are as follows:  (1) reduce the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous air pollutants by 75% nationally; (2) reduce national non-cancer risks substantially; and (3) address risks which are disproportionately posed on specific subpopulations and geographic areas.
In order to accomplish these goals, the EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  This component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives which focus on multi-media and cumulative risk, such as the Great Water program and EPA?s persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  
The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.
The purpose of this contract is to provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA?s air toxics program includes t he development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  EPA anticipates the award of a cost-plus fixed fee, level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Boise Id VAMC intends to award a single source purchase order to Mednet Cardiac Monitoring Services, 275 Phillips Blvd, Ewing, NH 08618 to provide services on a temporary basis for holter monitor download, review and report of cardiac monitoring for VA patients.  This temporary contract is for a six (6) month duration with an option to add another six (6) months if needed to allow enough time to complete a base plus four (4) option year contract for the Boise VAMC located at 500 W Fort Street, Boise, ID.  The NAICS code for the procurement is 621999 "Health screening services (except by offices of health practitioners)" with a size standard of $10.0 Million.  The Government believes that only Mednet Cardiac Monitoring Services can provide this temporary bridge service in the time frame needed because they are already established and security approved to provide similar services to the Boise VAMC.  This is a single source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive quotes however; any firm that believes that they can perform these services may give written notification to the Contracting Officer, VAMC Spokane, WA. 4815 N Assembly St, Spokane, WA. no later than 2:00 PM PT, March 15, 2011.

<DESC>Notice Type: 
Pre-Solicitation

Synopsis: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking architecture or architecture/engineering firms (NAICS 541310) capable of the planning and design of a new facility including master planning, infrastructure design, a VA Multi-specialty Outpatient Clinic, and Columbarium.  The  architecture or architecture/engineering firm must be capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, landscape design, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, geotechnical investigation and site surveying.  The prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects, Landscape Architects, Medical Planners, Structural Engineers, Seismic Design Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Geo-technical Engineers, Historic Preservation Architects, Environmental Engineers, Communications and Electrical Engineers, Interior Designers, Sustainable Design and LEED Accredited Professionals, and Cost Estimators with experience in the planning and design of new outpatient/ambulatory care clinics and columbaria.

Scope:
This project will construct an Outpatient Clinic (OPC), a Columbarium, administrative space for VHA, NCA and VBA and all associated parking on BRAC property at Alameda Point (former Naval Air Station) in Northern Alameda County.  The land for this project will be acquired through a no cost land transfer from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  This project will also construct a US Air Force satellite Primary Care Clinic and a jointly staffed VA/DoD Joint Ambulatory Surgical Center. This new, state-of-the-art OPC and administrative space will be approximately 134,000 - 162,000 gross square feet (GSF) and provide Primary Care, Specialty Care, Ancillary Services, Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Ambulatory Surgery. 

The replacement clinic will support:  full-service outpatient medical clinic providing primary care, specialty care, surgical care and ancillary services; full-service outpatient mental health and substance abuse program; audiology, dentistry, ancillary CT services, other clinical services; new Veterans Canteen Service for both food and retail services; two new ambulatory surgery minor procedure rooms, two endoscopy suites; a cystoscopy room, and administrative offices for VHA, NCA, and VBA.

The NCA columbaria and mausoleum will be planned to be constructed in several phases to be determined during design.  The new cemetery will include columbaria, roadways, walkways, internment shelters, landscape design, grounds maintenance facilities, and administrative spaces to be planned as part of the OPC structure.  

The project will require a comprehensive facility site plan and space plan.  The project will also require an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement (as appropriate), a historic preservation and mitigation work, and community outreach and public meetings.  Finally, a minimum of 370 surface parking spaces will be added to the site along with cortege parking and cueing areas for the Columbarium.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  The project will be required to attain a minimum of LEED Silver certification.   Renewable and innovative energy systems will be required as part of this project.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards. All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VAs criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities. The design will be required to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and PG-18-13 in all areas. Required services will include preparation of equipment and furniture plans and schedules, schematics design, design development, and construction documents (both plans and specifications), medical and research equipment planning, site design, and including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a detailed estimate of construction cost. 

At this time it is anticipated that the Site Utility, Infrastructure, Roadway and Walkway design could follow the design-build delivery method of procurement, The Columbarium could also follow the design-build delivery method with a phased implementation, and the Clinic is planned to follow the design-bid-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs, site constraints, and bidding environment have been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method.  The contract will include options for: design development documents, construction documents, construction period services, site visits, and other professional services.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical and memorial facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on cost and scope management capabilities and previous successful experience with construction of medical facilities, along with the proposed Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures.   In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation as set forth in the VA BIM Guideline.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  The design for all parts of this project are required to meet all national, state, and local building codes, regulations, and standards as well as all VA design guides and design requirements.  All VA design guides and requirements can be found online at:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/.  Where conflicts occur between VA standards and model codes, the most stringent requirement shall govern.

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  A market study and an estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The phases include Schematic Design 1, Schematic Design 2, Design Development 1, Design Development 2, and Construction Documents.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction at time of award.  More design submission requirements can be found in VA Guide PG-18-15.

Pre-Solicitation

Synopsis: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking architecture or architecture/engineering firms (NAICS 541310) capable of the planning and design of newly constructed and renovated hospitals, large outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, health care and biomedical research, and similarly complex healthcare projects.  The  architecture or architecture/engineering firms must be capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, geotechnical investigation and surveying, seismic design for new and existing buildings, and vivaria.  The prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects, Medical Planners, Structural Engineers, Seismic Design Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Geo-technical Engineers, Historic Preservation Architects, Environmental Engineers, Communications and Electrical Engineers, Interior Designers, Sustainable Design and LEED Accredited Professionals, and Cost Estimators. All members should have experience in the planning and design of new hospitals, large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, medical research facilities, or similar complex healthcare projects.

Scope:
This project proposes to demolish Building 12 and construct a new, state-of-the-art medical research facility at an expanded size of approximately 67,500 to 82,500 gross square feet (GSF) at the San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC).  The project also proposes to seismically retrofit Buildings 1, 6, and 8 to correct potentially hazardous facility, seismic, life safety and infrastructure deficiencies.  As part of this project, it is planned that research program space will be transferred from Buildings 1 and 6 to the new, replacement Building 12. Building 1 is planned to be renovated to house mainly clinical office space in order to allow decompression of Building 203 (the main hospital), and Building 200 (the main ambulatory care support building).  Building 6 is planned to remain administrative services, while Building 8 is planned to retain ambulatory mental health and research functions.  The project will require a comprehensive facility site plan and space plan.  The project will also require an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement (as appropriate), a historic preservation and mitigation work, and community outreach and public meetings.  Finally, a minimum of 250 additional parking spaces will be added to the campus in structured parking to reduce the current 750-space deficiency at SFVAMC.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  The project will be required to attain a minimum of LEED Silver certification.  Renewable and innovative energy systems will be required as part of this project.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards. All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VAs criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities. The design will be required to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and PG-18-13 in all areas. Required services will include preparation of equipment and furniture plans and schedules, schematics design, design development, and construction documents (both plans and specifications), medical and research equipment planning, site design, and including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost. 

At this time it is anticipated that the seismic retrofits of Buildings 1, 6, 8 and the Building 12 Replacement design could follow the design-bid-build delivery method and Site Utility design could follow the design-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method.  The contract will include options for: design development documents, construction documents, construction period services, site visits, and other professional services.

<DESC>76 AMXG Flight Test Augment - Request for Information (RFI)
<p><br />1. The 76 AMXG is requesting an RFI for the availability of viable contract sources for the augmentation of the Air Force Reserve fight test operations personnel that perform Functional Check Flights (FCF) on aircraft that undergo Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) and modification at Tinker AFB. This will include FCF for the B-1, B-52, E-3 and KC-135 airframes. 76 AMXG is not looking for a permanent, co-located capability but rather the ability to tap into trained and certified contractor flight crew members for the above mentioned airframes at short notice ("just in time"). These crewmembers could be located remotely. Augmentation could require an entire FCF flight crew or individual crew positions. Requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>MAINTENANCE OPERATIONAL CHECKS:</p>
<p>a. Maintenance operational checks will be accomplished on the ground to ensure aircraft systems or components, which have been disturbed during inspection or maintenance operations, have been repaired, reassembled or adjusted satisfactorily. The checks will be accomplished to simulate the conditions under which the system or component will be operated. The affected equipment will be operated through a sufficient number of cycles to ensure aircraft is safe for operational use.</p>
<p>FUNCTIONAL CHECK FLIGHTS:</p>
<p>a. Check flights will be performed to determine whether an aircraft and its various components are functioning according to predetermined specifications while subjected to the flight environment. Airborne functional checks of aircraft systems, subsystems or equipment when subjected to design environment are operating properly. Full FCF profiles are flown when required. Check flights will be conducted in the day or night when Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) exists at the departure airfield.</p>
<p>b. Check flights will be accomplished by aircrew possessing the best qualifications. All check flights accomplished on USAF aircraft by contractor personnel will be performed by flight crews qualified in accordance with the provisions of DCMA Instruction 8210.1, Contractors Flight and Ground Operations or earlier version as defined by contract.</p>
<p>c. The PDM work specification and applicable T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-1 will be used as guidance for the FCF. Unit developed check flight cards or checklist may be provided by the government. These checklists specify minimum requirements for accomplishment of FCF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;REQUIRED POSITIONS FOR FCF COMPLETION:</p>
<p>a. B-1 <br />- Pilot<br />- Co-pilot<br />- Offensive Systems Officer<br />- Defensive Systems officer</p>
<p>b. B-52<br />- Pilot <br />- Co-pilot<br />- Navigator</p>
<p>c. E-3<br />- Pilot<br />- Co-pilot<br />- Navigator<br />- Flight Engineer</p>
<p>d. KC-135<br />- Pilot<br />- Co-Pilot<br />- Navigator<br />- Boomer</p>
<p><br />FERRY SERVICE</p>
<p>a. The contractor may be required to ferry aircraft to and from home stations or bases located CONUS or OCONUS.</p>
<p>TRAINING:<br />a. Aircrews will adhere to the training and currency requirements as outlined in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 61, Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors, current edition for the category and class aircraft they are qualified in. Aircrews must be current and qualified in their primary USAF aircraft in addition to being current and qualified IAW FAA CFR standards in order to fly the additional aircraft.</p>
<p>4. In addition to all other vendor information, interested parties will be required to include the following information:</p>
<p>a. Vendor business size (large or small business) under this NAICS code<br />b. Vendors are requested to provide all pertinent information that will supply verification that<br />the vendor has all of the necessary resources to fulfill the AF requirement.<br />c. Vendors are requested to provide the amount of "lead time" or notification time required<br />in order to have a crew in place at Tinker AFB for FCT.<br />d. Vendors must be able to provide verifications of all the required certifications stated in<br />this RFI.</p>
<p>4. Replies and questions for this request can be made to the following POCs:<br />Caren Annesley, Contract Negotiator, OC-ALC/PKEA 405-739-9120 or Tony Kyzer, Contracting Officer, OC-ALC/PKEA, 405-739-3962.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) pending the availability of funds for competitive proposals resulting in awards of separate contracts for Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), formerly known as Peer Review Organizations (PROs) for the States of Maine, Vermont, Idaho, Texas and the Territory of Virgin Islands. In order to be eligible to receive a QIO contract, an Offeror must: 1) satisfactorily demonstrate physician-sponsorship or physician access as defined in Sections 1152 and 1153 of the Act at the time its proposal is submitted; 2) must meet the definition of a utilization and quality control peer review organization as set forth in Section 1152 of the Social Security Act (the Act); and 3) be deemed a responsible entity in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9.1. In addition, an Offeror must not be a health care facility, health care facility association, health care facility affiliate or payor organization; and must have a consumer representative on its governing board. QIOs are responsible for review of certain health care services furnished under Title XVIII of the Act in addition to working to improve the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Each QIO is responsible for meeting all requirements as defined in the RFP and resultant contract. The period of performance will be for three (3) years. The RFP is anticipated to be released on the Federal Business Opportunities website within the next two to three weeks. Telephone or facsimile requests for the RFP will not be honored. CMS will host a Conference on March 28, 2011 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (local prevailing time-Baltimore, MD) to discuss the recently released Draft 10th Statement of Work (Fed Biz Opps Special Notice Number CMS3411). The 10th Statement of Work Conference may be accessed by telephone, webinar, and in person. Further details concerning the Conference will be forthcoming in a separate posting on this website under this Solicitation Number. Offerors are further informed that in an earlier Federal Register announcement (FR Doc. 2010-28817 Filed 11-24-10; 8:45 am) published on November 24, 2010, CMS informed industry of the states in which there are no "In-State" QIOs. The current states where there are no "In-State" QIOs are: Maine, Vermont and Idaho. Offerors should note that the State of South Carolina was also named in this FR announcement but was included in error. To qualify as an "In-State" QIO, an organization must meet the definition of Section 1153(i)(3) of the Act which provides that an "In-State" organization is an organization that has its primary place of business in the State in which review will be conducted (or, which is owned by a parent corporation the headquarters of which is located in such state). In addition to meeting the previously stated eligibility requirements, Offerors electing to submit proposals for the States of Maine, Vermont and Idaho must also be deemed to have "In-State" status according to the Act. In the event there are no qualified "In-State" QIOs eligible to respond to the RFP for the States of Maine, Vermont and Idaho, CMS will only consider proposals from the QIOs who currently hold the 9th SOW contract for these states. For the State of Texas and the Territory of Virgin Islands, Offerors must meet the eligibility requirements of responsibility, physician-sponsorship or physician-access and may or may not be an "In-State" organization.

<DESC>Sources Sought<br />Department of Homeland Security (DHS),<br />United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS),<br />Office of Human Capital and Training<br />Workers Compensation Claims Management System (WCCMS)
<p><br />1 PURPOSE</p>
<p>USCIS desires a web-based case management system to identify and track trends, make an analysis of workplace injuries and illnesses, conduct effective case management, and generate reports for the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS Senior Management annual reporting requirements.</p>
<p>USCIS desires to purchase commercial or non-developmental software or commercial software that could be modified to meet USCIS requirements. USCIS desires to also know to what extent USCIS would need to modify USCIS requirements to meet commercially available software specifications.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a solicitation or a commitment to issue a solicitation. It is issued for the purpose of conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to determine industry capabilities, including those of small businesses, to meet the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>No solicitation is being issued at this time and the Government makes no assertion that a solicitation will be issued. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for, any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice.</p>
<p>2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USCIS Office of Human Capital and Training (HCT) provides oversight and management for the overall USCIS Workers' Compensation Program (WCP). Currently, the processing, analyzing, compiling, and generating of reports is performed manually.</p>
<p>3 SCOPE</p>
<p>USCIS contemplates purchasing six tasks using a fixed price contract as follows:</p>
<p>Task Description<br />1 Provide COTS (commercial off the shelf product)<br />2 Install COTS software<br />3 Implementation of COTS software<br />4 Train USCIS Personnel<br />5 Project management<br />6 Maintenance and Support</p>
<p>The USCIS Workers' Compensation Program requires a software package to track and manage all stages of the workers compensation program claims process. The WCP application must have the capability to accommodate at least 50 concurrent users. Options for additional users may be purchased. Designated USCIS WCP personnel, supervisors, and injured employees will be the primary users of this system. The software application must have the capability to submit and receive claim data to the Department of Labor and interface with the National Finance Center Payroll and Processing Center.</p>
<p>USCIS desires a system that offers a case management feature that will allow USCIS worker compensation personnel access to real-time injury/illness claim data specific to their location for purposes of:<br />&bull; compiling and generating reports to meet annual reporting requirements, <br />&bull; identifying and tracking trends to make an analysis of workplace injuries and illnesses, <br />&bull; providing status on day-to-day activity to allow effective case management, and <br />&bull; allowing the WCP Manager access to USCIS-wide claims data to allow program oversight</p>
<p>The vendor shall deliver the software 30 days from award and provide installation support of the software on a central server, and will use Oracle or SQL as its database source. The server shall allow multiple USCIS employees to use the software simultaneously. It is anticipated that the software and database will reside on a server hosted by the Government and USCIS users will access the software from "client" computers through a web browser. Also required will be software maintenance, installation support, technical support, system administration manuals, user manuals, and training for functional users and administrative users.</p>
<p>4. RESPONSE FORMAT AND GUIDELINES</p>
<p>4.1 Format, delivery date, and point of contact</p>
<p>Responses shall be in Microsoft Word for Office 2003 (.doc) format and are due no later than March 18, 2011 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET). All responses will be submitted via <br />e-mail (virus scanned) to the point of contact listed below:</p>

<p>Section 2 of the response shall address, in detail, the firm's capabilities to provide the type of software and services identified in Section 3 of this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>5. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.

The output may or may not be considered sensitive.
<p>&bull; The intent of the validation device is to assure that the operators who use a particular device are in fact approved to print from that device and the correct operator (or approved substitute) is in fact retrieving it. <br />&bull; The intent of this action is to provide assurance for targeted printers, scanners and copiers meet the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12). <br />&bull; The intent of the device is to assure any product scanned into the Government internal network, is in fact an approved operator and in fact the scanned product is correctly routed to the operators desktop or mailbox and no one else.<br />&bull; The intent of the device is to assure that the copier, printer scanner, MFD secured by this device requires a CAC card and pin before functioning. <br />&bull; The intent of this device is to assure the correct recipient always gets the correct product and distribution is narrowed to only the designated recipient. <br />&bull; The intent of this device is to provide Public Key Encryption between a scanned document and the recipients mailbox or desktop.</p>
<p>CURRENTLY:<br />&bull; The Defense Logistics Agency Distribution Operations at New Cumberland and supported distribution operations worldwide, operate a large amount of administrative copiers, printers and multi-function devices that are manufactured by various companies. <br />&bull; Many but not all of the Multi-Function Devices (MFD) are of Kyocera manufacturer (Task Alpha series). There are copiers, printers and MFD of other manufacture also in the same print plant. <br />&bull; DOD uses and will used for this function the DOD Common Access Card (CAC) for and X509 certificate for accreditation via LDAP and OCSP. The access card meets the specifics of FIPS201-1.</p>
<p>SPECIFICS: <br />&bull; Any potential product/system must have the ability to work with multiple vendors of printers and MFD products. <br />&bull; Any potential device must be able to scan block. That is defined as approve or block scans going upstream by device. <br />&bull; Any potential device must provide automatic electronic termination of any/all predefined function when the CAC is removed. Conversely; some functions as preprogrammed can only occur with an inserted, approved and validated CAC. <br />&bull; Any potential device must use must provide at least 2 RJ45 connections for 100baseT Ethernet and TCP/IP convention Ipv4 and be upgradeable to Ipv6 when required with a configuration or simple software or firmware change.<br />&bull; Any approved device must operate on an Ethernet and TCP/IP network be separately IP address able and be capable of interfacing with at least 2 CAT6 cables (one to the network and one to the MFD). <br />&bull; Any potential device must allow remote web access into the device to assure functionality, check running statistics if available and alter the configuration dynamically or near dynamically. <br />&bull; Any potential products must have the ability to read a CAC card certificate, provide an entrance mechanism for the operator to enter a pin number without display, accept the pin and successfully validate that user credentials/ X509 certificate at the appropriate PKI server via with OSCP and LDAP protocols. <br />&bull; Any device must authenticate to NTLMV2 or better. <br />&bull; The device must support all DOD SMART cards including ISO/IEC 7816 and ISO/IEC 7810. <br />&bull; Any potential device must be able to prevent traffic to and from the printer, copier, scanner or MFD until the pin number has been entered and the credentials validated. <br />&bull; Any potential device allowing any print until any CAC is validated is not acceptable, if that feature is turned on. <br />&bull; Any potential device must be able to pre-determine permissions for the approved function and escalate the restrictions for all. Restrictions and/or permissions by particular user/operator are not required. Permissions are to be assigned by device rather than individual. <br />&bull; Any device must be portable, not vendor or model specific and can be removed and installed on other copiers, printers, scanners, MFD as the mission dictates. <br />&bull; Any encryption must meet the requirements of FIPS 128 or FIPS 120-2 for all traffic scanned into the device and deposited on the users/operators mailbox or desktop. Print traffic is not designed to be encrypted and encrypted print traffic to the printer or MFD is not required at this time.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Sources Sought Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>This is a sources sought synopsis, and is not a Request for Proposal. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC with project work described below. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI). For information on NRC OCOI regulations, visit the NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5, entitled "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below and submit the capability information as described below. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than <br /><strong>April 13, 2011</strong>. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email (Claudia.Melgar@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Claudia G. Melgar, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts, MS TWB - 01-B10M, 12300 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD 20852.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors and nuclear materials in the United States. The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and providing regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions made by the agency, and in addition prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues of current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>RES maintains and develops the thermal-hydraulic system code TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine (TRACE), which is used for analyses of transients in operating reactors, analyses to support resolution of generic issues, evaluation of emergency procedures and accident management strategies, and supporting analyses for the certification of advanced reactor designs.</p>
<p>The TRACE code is subject to continual development and testing due to its reliance upon empirically based constitutive models. The need for development arises in two ways: <br />a) assessment results for an existing code model indicate that models have either a bias or uncertainty that affect the degree of realism and/or conservatism of the simulation, or b) a code model required for an important phenomenon, process, or system is not available. An example of the former is that the assessment of interfacial drag in rod bundles at low pressure conditions indicated that the TRACE model has a bias towards under-prediction of the core inventory. This bias would result in an overly conservative calculation for boil-off transients where the code would predict an early uncovery and higher than actual peak clad temperatures.</p>
<p>The proposed contract seeks experimental assistance for TRACE code development including numerical model development and code testing, benchmarking, and model implementation. The current request is associated with awarding the fourth such contract that has previously been awarded to Purdue University under the umbrella of the Thermal-hydraulic Institute (THI). THI has provided NRC staff with this developmental assistance under subsequent contracts,<br />since 1997. Recent task orders under the latest contract have concentrated on separate effects experiments to address agency generic issues (e.g., GSI-193) and other separate effects experiments to develop and validate models that allow the TRACE code to simulate proper liquid inventory in the chimney region of a boiling water reactor during loss of coolant transients. The work will include the carrying out of advanced experiments and modeling the complex behavior of two-phase fluid flow as it relates to very detailed processes that occur in nuclear power systems. Separate-effects experimental testing is generally used but integral systems testing may also be required.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Sought:</strong></p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing experimental and modeling assistance in development of the TRACE thermal-hydraulic code. Specific capabilities would include extensive expertise in research in thermal hydraulics and reactor safety analysis involving studies of two-phase flow, heat transfer, phase change, coolant channel dynamics, and various other phenomena related to reactor safety, and the laboratory facilities that support this research. The organization may be requested to provide experimental facilities and tests results of certain phenomena needed by the agency. These advanced experiments would require engineering expertise to design and manufacture test equipment with advanced instrumentation, extract test results, assess and validate quality of test data, use that information to build or enhance existing models in the code, and provide code benchmarks of tests to show the improvement in code performance.</p>
<p>The organization would need to provide a very broad technical expertise and perform thermal-hydraulics nuclear reactor safety research for the NRC with areas of research including: intricate familiarization with modern two-phase fluid code architectures and languages, comprehensive knowledge and understanding of advanced two-phase fluid numerical methods, two-phase fluid model construction, experience with code constitutive models and correlations, graphical user interfaces, multiphase CFD, and the fundamental experimental requirements. RES will require highly qualified technical specialists with extensive expertise in the technical areas described.</p>
<p>The organization and its contractors must have extensive research experience with demonstrated knowledge of historical and current nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulic related systems code issues. The contractors should have in-depth knowledge in this technical area in order to independently identify and resolve issues. The contractor principle investigators should also be technically competence and creditable to participate in technical discussion and questions during periodic Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards reviews and presentations. The investigators must have appropriate levels of engineering education and experience commensurate with this level of research, and exhaustive knowledge of current and advanced Boiling Water Reactor, Pressurized Water Reactor, high temperature, and small modular reactor system designs and issues. Experience and participation with industry committees and/or advisory activities is also highly desired.</p>
<p>The organization also must have existing laboratories that are well equipped and capable of providing results of various reactor system two-phase fluid behaviors within a reasonable schedule. The facilities should consist of wide-ranging and extensive experimental loops to replicate various full-plant reactor systems or subsystems. The facilities should have advanced calibrated instrumentation systems supported by integrated computer data acquisition systems designed for studying nuclear thermal-hydraulics and the complexities of two-phase flow. The test loops shall be capable of simulating adiabatic flow as well as two-phase boiling with the potential to reach dryout conditions. The facility must have adequately-designed and robust instrumentation for monitoring and safe control of the thermal-hydraulic processes. The separate-effects test facilities may be required to provide flow visualization via high speed video and/or other specialized instruments to characterize and validate the desired phenomena. Integral facility system tests may also be required to reproduce certain reactor system safety issues.

San Francisco, CA - Buildings 1, 6 and 8 Seismic Retrofit / Building 12 Replacement Construction
POC Selection Process:  Katherine Volpe, Contracting Officer, 707-562-8399; 
POC Scope: Warren Yip, Project Manager, 707-562-8423.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking interested firms that are classified under one or more of the following small business programs: (1) Section 8(a), (2) HUB Zone, (3) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), (4) Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), (5) Service-Disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and/or (6) Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB). The interested firms shall be architects or architect/engineer firms with experience in the planning and design of renovating hospitals, large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, or similar complex healthcare projects and capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, and geotechnical investigation and surveying.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 541310.

Scope:
This project proposes to demolish Building 12 and construct a new, state-of-the-art medical facility at an expanded size of 75,000 gross square feet (GSF) at the San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC). The project also proposes to seismically retrofit Buildings 1, 6 and 8 to correct potentially hazardous facility, seismic, life safety and infrastructure deficiencies. As part of this project, research program space will be transferred from Buildings 1 and 6 to the new, replacement Building 12. Building 1 will be renovated to house clinical office space in order to allow decompression of Building 203, the main hospital, and Building 200, the main ambulatory care support building. Building 6 will retain administrative services, while Building 8 will retain ambulatory mental health and research functions. Finally, 250 additional parking spaces will be provided to reduce the current 750-space deficiency at SFVAMC.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities.  The space will be in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.

At this time it is anticipated that the seismic retrofits of Buildings 1, 6, 8 and the Building 12 Replacement design will follow the design-bid-build delivery method and Site Utility design will follow the design-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method.

The contract may include options for: design development documents, construction documents, construction period services, site visits, and other professional services.

The completed project will be required to be LEED Silver certified.  Renewable energy systems will be required as part of this project.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on cost and scope management capabilities and previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the proposed Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures.   In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  All VA design guides and requirements can be found online at:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/. 

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.

Applicants must have an established working office within 50 miles of San Francisco, California and be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of California.  Preference will be given to firms with working offices capable of performing all design work within 50 miles of the San Francisco VA Medical Center, 4150 Clement Street, San Francisco, California  94121.  Office site visits to verify location and capacity may be performed.

All interested firms responses should include the following information: 1. Company Name, 2. Address, 3. Point of Contact, 4. Phone number and e-mail address, 5. Business size determination and qualifying Small Business status, 6. Certification of Small business Status, 7. Provide three to five examples of design experience with projects of similar size and complexity with the prime contractor performing the role of Architect of Record. Please limit responses to ten pages.  Responses are required by 1:00 p.m. (PDT) on 4 February 2011 by email to:  katherine.volpe@va.gov.

For questions regarding scope, please call Warren Yip on 707-562-8423.  For questions regarding contracting or the selection process, please call Katherine Volpe on 707-562-8399.

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is an update to a previously posted RFI.  The goal is to determine what advances have occurred in the past year if any. <br><br>Peptides are central to numerous research efforts at the Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) due to their extensive sequence landscape, chemical diversity and broad range of functionality.  There are currently five on-going research projects which require peptide synthesis with additional project anticipated. The Government expects this need for peptide synthesis to continue for a number of years. To date, each project has identified the need for peptide synthesis work as it occurs; and separate orders/contracts have been awarded for peptide synthesis.  With the modification to the procurement procedures, the past approach has become time consuming leading to delays which has been impeding progress to individual projects. <br><br>This Request for Information should be considered an open call for providing the government peptide synthesis needs. The Government requires two general classes of peptide synthesis: (1) linear peptide synthesis; and (2) cyclized peptide synthesis.  Additionally, the Government may require peptide arrays.  This performance-based service contract incorporates the following performance objectives:  (1) Synthesize peptides with specified sequence and purity (2) adherence to contract schedule, milestone, and delivery requirements, and (3) efficient and effective cost control.  The contractor's primary focus shall be to synthesize peptides based on the Government's specified sequence and purity.  The specific sequence, purity and quanity for each delivery order will be include on the individual delivery order.  All peptide synthesis shall include reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry analysis.  A certificate of analysis shall be required with each shipment.  In addition, peptide arrays will require peptides to be uncoupled, in individual containers with a purification step. It is the contractor's responsibility to employ the necessary resources to ensure accomplishment of these objectives.  The government expects some face-to-face contact to ensure some specific requirement are understood and successfully accomplished, therefore we are looking for contractors who are "local' to the NSRDEC.<br><br>This RFI is solely for information purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such information.<br>

The contractor's primary focus shall be to synthesize peptides based on the Government's specified sequence and purity.  The specific sequence, purity and quanity for each delivery order will be include on the individual delivery order.  All peptide synthesis shall include reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry analysis.  A certificate of analysis shall be required with each shipment.  In addition, peptide arrays will require peptides to be uncoupled, in individual containers with a purification step. It is the contractor's responsibility to employ the necessary resources to ensure accomplishment of these objectives.  The government expects some face-to-face contact to ensure some specific requirement are understood and successfully accomplished, therefore we are looking for contractors who are "local' to the NSRDEC.<br><br>This RFI is solely for information purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7520-01-241-4229<br />Name: Pencil Sharpener, Electric<br />Description: Electric pencil sharpener with titanium blades. Auto sensor &amp; auto eject. Hands free.</p>
<p>NSN: 7520-01-316-4446<br />Name: Pencil Sharpener, Battery Operated<br />Description: Battery operated pencil sharpener with titanium blades. Auto sensor &amp; auto eject. Hands free.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7520-01-241-4229<br />Similar Items: ACM14201, ACM14203, BOSEPS10HC (BOSEPS10HCBLK), BOSEPS10HCPRL, EPI1645, EPI1670, EPI1675, EPI1716, EPI1744, EPI1796, EPI1797, PANKP150BK (PANKP150), PANKP380BK (PANKP380), SWI29967, SWI29968</p>
<p>NSN: 7520-01-316-4446<br />Similar Items: ACM14629-002 (ACM 14629-100), ACM14204, ACM14768, ACM14885, BOS02697, EPI16701, EPI16750, EPI16774, PANKP006AB (PANKP006)</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 25, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for modification to extend period of performance.
REQUESTING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  The Division of Contracting and the General Services on behalf of the Division of Engineering plans to contract on a Sole Source basis.  This document sets forth the justification and approval as required by FAR 6.303.                        
NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION TO BE APPROVED: Justification is requested to modify the existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for Architect-Engineer Services Contracts to include contract 701816D041 with PDC, Inc. and 701815D042 with HDR Engineering to extend the period of performance for 6-months while the Region 7 pursues replacement contracts for this service.  These contracts expire on February 28, 2010 
DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: .The 6-month period of performance extension for this indefinite quantity vehicle shall result in an increase of not more than $500,000.00  for both contracts.  Historical award under these contracts include $2M in awards to HDR and $300K in awards to PDC for the 5-year period.  Projects include construction and non-routine maintenance projects  requiring architectural-engineering support of these contracts. Construction support for projects design by these firms will also be a requirement under the proposed contract extension.
STATUTORY AUTHORITY: .
Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. (FAR 6.302-1) 
DEMONSTRATION OF REQUIREMENT OF AUTHORITY:  Extension of this contract is necessary to fulfill agency needs while replacement IDIQ contracts for this service are acquired.   Use of other than an IDIQ to fulfill agency needs while replacement contracts are being procured is not conducive to the mission of  supporting 17 remote facilities many with deferred maintenance requirements and  life safety issues.  These requirements often surface unexpectedly due to subjection of facilities to regional harsh arctic and subarctic conditions.  Procurement of standalone contracts for the listed requirements and unplanned actions will cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling essential services to support systems and structural issues for remote facilities. Design-build is also considered. While this procedure is a viable solution it is often not practicable for many of the  small rehab project historically procured under these contracts.  In addition, FWS needs the continued services of these firms for construction phase services on awarded contracts.  As designers-of-record, use of these firms for follow-on engineering oversight of construction in progress is the most practical and cost effective solution. Foremost, the award of contracts with periods of performance extending beyond the implementation of the Financial Business Management System (FBMS) scheduled in the fall of 2011 is precluded due to data conversion limitations. Conversion of data is a monumental task for the agency and avoidance of conversion of long-term contracts from the existing IDEAS contract writing system to the new FBMS integrated contracting and financial system will avoid potential long term labor intensive administrative issues. Award of replacement contracts shall be consistent with FBMS implementation of November 2011.  
 EFFORTS TO ENSURE WIDE RANGE OF OFFERS:  
MARKET RESEARCH:  Market research shall be pursued to conduct the new procurement for these services.  This modification to extend the current contract will provide the agency a contract vehicle to support mission requirements while the market research and the procurement is conducted.    An announcement was posted in FBO on 23 November for a 30-day period.  Responses to the announcement will be considered.   OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS:Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  1.	Statements of work for individual requirements listed above shall be provided consistent with normal IDIQ contract procedures and are generally developed with each Task Order request for proposal. 2.	 The Competitive Demonstration Act previously precluded the Government from setting aside contracts in this NAICS code; however, with the repeal of the act new opportunities for small business set asides will have a significant bearing on the procurement strategy for the replacement contracts
LIST OF INTERESTED SOURCES:  No firms have expressed an interest to date.   
STATEMENT OF ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:   The Government will take the following actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the required supplies or service:1.	This non-competitive procurement shall be used as a bridge to provide time to develop competitive specifications for a future competitive procurement to be issued before March of 2011.2.	 The task order requirements for this IDIQ are generally for smaller projects which is conducive to small business AE firms.  The specification for the replacement contracts shall allow small business firms to qualify for this multi-disciplined requirement by allowing them to use subcontractors for some disciplines.  Depending on the results of market research, it is anticipated the replacement contracts for this service shall consist of multiple contracts to small business.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt;">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span>is offering the opportunity to </span>license intellectual property rights covering this technology for commercialization.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Background</span></span></strong><strong><span>: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ability to detect gamma rays and/or neutrons is a vital tool for many areas of research. Gamma-ray/neutron detectors allow scientists to study celestial phenomena and diagnose medical diseases, and they have been used to determine the yield in an underground nuclear test. Today, these detectors are important tools for homeland security, helping the nation confront new security challenges.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One particularly useful type of radiation detection, pulse shape discrimination (PSD), which is exhibited by some organic scintillators, involves subtle physical phenomena which give rise to the delayed luminescence characteristic of neutrons, providing a means of distinguishing neutrons from the preponderance of prompt luminescence arising from background gamma interactions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Stilbene has been found to be the most effective organic scintillator in terms of PSD, size, and optical quality compared to other organic scintillators including liquids. </span>However, single-crystal stilbene, has a very limited availability because of difficulties in its crystal growth from melt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Accordingly, it would be beneficial to grow organic scintillator crystals, including stilbene and other types of crystals, using solution growth, which should thereby increase access to such materials as well as significantly reduce their cost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Description</span></span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>LLNL has identified </span>solution-grown organic crystals having scintillation efficiency not only close to, but even exceeding that of stilbene.<span>. LLNL&rsquo;s invention relates to a new class of neutron detectors based on scintillation response of organic single crystals. More specifically, the use of organic molecules grown from solution and to molecules including the basic benzene or phenyl structure. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Widespread use of single crystal inorganic scintillators is seen in medical imaging, high energy physics, and environmental radiation monitoring applications. These crystals are typically hygroscopic requiring air-tight housing for handling and their fabrication is costly. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Transparent polycrystalline ceramics of rare earth garnets show promise for easing fabrication and reducing costs as well as allowing customization of fabrication components. Since garnets are oxides, they offer excellent handling and fabrication advantages, compared to the more commonly employed halide scintillators.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Transparent ceramics are polycrystalline optics formed by consolidation of nanocrystalline precursors into a fully dense solid. Transparent polycrystalline ceramics not only allow production costs to be substantially reduced, but permit the fabrication of compositions that do not melt congruently and are, therefore, unobtainable via melt growth. Furthermore, activator concentration and uniformity can be considerably increased over melt-grown crystals.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Description:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Transparent ceramic fabrication allows the production of gadolinium- , lutetium-, and terbium-based garnets which are difficult to grow by melt techniques due to phase instabilities. Phase stabilization of the garnets is accomplished by the addition of the intersubstitutional ions, Gallium and/or Scandium.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Scientists have developed many versatile and scaleable fabrication methods. One includes using Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP) to produce feedstock which is readily converted into phase-pure transparent ceramics. The FSP nanoparticles are formed into a green body, vacuum sintered, then hot-isostatic pressed into optically transparent parts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The transparent ceramic scintillators have been found to provide a surprisingly high light yield which results in gamma ray spectroscopy energy resolution superior to known oxide scintillators.</span></p>

The speed of measurement must be higher than 1 min per scan from 300 nm to 1600 nm with a signal/noise ratio better than 10. These will enable the fast screening of vast number of DNA sequences for ion-exchange chromatography based single chirality single-wall carbon nanotube separation, which is a key deliverable for the carbon nanotube metrology project. High enough sensitivity is also required in order to provide NIST researchers reliable information for the determination of subsequent choice of DNA sequences.<br /><br />Agilent Technologies, Inc., is the only vendor capable of providing the required small-volume, high sensitivity and high speed UV-vis-near IR spectrophotometer in order to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. Agilent Technologies, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 25, 2011, 3:30 p.m. EST.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Vermont Center for Ecostudies developed the bird monitoring protocol being used by the NPS, and has also built up a network of volunteers who participate in this project.  VCE is knowledgeable in the specifics of this monitoring program, familiar with the parks and the specific bird monitoring routes being used, and VCE has been implementing this protocol for the NPS since 2006.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 52 is to obligate $2,047,022 in new funding for Option Period 3 in support of several Work Assignments issued to support the Office of Water's efforts related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. These work assignments are as follows:<br /><br />Work Assignment 3-101 which has an anticipated period of performance of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $537,951.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work Assignment 3-102 which has an anticipated period of performance of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $200,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work Assignment 3-103 which has an anticipated period of performance of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $904,374.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work Assignment 3-105 which has an anticipated period of performance of April 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $50,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work Assignment 3-106 which has an anticipated period of performance of January 28, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $500,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work Assignment 3-107 which has an anticipated period of performance of March 14, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $475,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Under WA 3-101, the contractor will continue to provide support for technical and administrative tasks to inform and coordinate Regional and Headquarters policy development and decision-making on meeting the BA provisions of ARRA particularly in regard to requests for waivers from the requirements of section 1605. Efforts include:<br />&#61553; Collect and log all requests for waivers from the requirements of the Buy American provisions of the ARRA. <br />&#61553; Evaluate waiver requests related to the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater facilities to ensure waivers comply with applicable justifications.<br />&#61553; Evaluate construction cost estimates and develop detailed independent construction cost estimates as needed to evaluate waiver requests for the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater treatment facilities, including estimated costs for iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods. Compare project costs using goods manufactured in the US compared to foreign manufactured goods. <br />&#61553; Prepare a report on each waiver. <br />&#61553; Develop a tracking spreadsheet database documenting each waiver request.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-102, the contractor will continue to provide the technical and logistical assistance to support the EPA in achieving the goal, objectives and requirements of the ARRA provisions as to "Green Infrastructure." Efforts will revolve around the review of DWSRF project proposals received by the individual State for ARRA funding to determine whether those projects have a green component, and make recommendations for green practices that can be incorporated into the projects. The effort will include providing technical assistance to states and applicants in developing and reviewing the "business cases" that are submitted along with projects in support of considering them as green projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary focus is on the green aspects of drinking water infrastructure projects. The work is intended to supplement and be coordinated with EPA's efforts for the GPR through the CWSRF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This work assignment will benefit the agency by advancing our goal of encouraging the development and implementation of projects that provide the social, health and environmental benefits to be derived from "environmentally green" projects under ARRA's Green Project Reserve (GPR).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Under WA 3-103, the contractor will continue to provide the expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: tracking the program's implementation; reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts; assisting and training EPA Regional Offices in the oversight of State ARRA programs; training and assisting States in implementing their ARRA program including tracking and providing technical assistance to applicants; developing information to assess the successful implementation of the program; and providing reports on achievements to senior EPA and Executive Branch officials, the U.S. Congress, the water industry and other stakeholders and the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-105, the contractor will provide needed technical and engineering support to EPA Region III in its oversight of DC in order to ensure successful implementation of the ARRA requirements for ARRA-funded DDOE CW projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-106, the contractor will support an evaluative process of EPA's drinking water and wastewater utility management; utilities that have received ARRA funding will be given technical assistance and guidance to implement utility management practices that are expected to lead to improved sustainability of the ARRA funded project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Subsequently, the contractor will provide support for the iterative evaluation using the Effective Utility Management (EUM) framework and tools (e.g. EUM Primer, Keys to Management Success, sample performance measures) of 100 utilities that received ARRA funds for water infrastructure improvements. Following each evaluation, the contractor will work with the utility to develop an improvement plan based on the assessment and the priority each utility places on specific management attributes. A subset of utilities that are pre-identified by states will receive on-site technical assistance and training to implement their improvement plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-107, the contractor will provide support to EPA and State SRF programs in the management and oversight of ARRA funds provided to the SRF assistance recipients. Management/oversight of the SRF ARRA funds will include assisting EPA and State SRF programs in the review/inspection of State SRF assistance recipients to ensure proper use of ARRA funds and compliance with ARRA requirements. Specifically, the contractor shall conduct 182 inspections and document reviews involving SRF assistance recipients in the following States: New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Minnesota, Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contractor will not be liable for consequential damages as defined in the Warranty Exclusion and Limitation of Damages provisions, if any contained herein.<br />3.Damage to Government Property from causes other than the Contractor's Negligence - Nothing in the above paragraph shall be considered to preclude the Government from receiving the benefits of any insurance the Contractor may carry which provides for indemnification for any loss or destruction of, damage to property in the custody and care of the Contractor where such loss, destruction, or damage is to Government Property. The contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's right to recover against third parties for any loss, destruction of, or damage to Government property, and upon the request of the Contracting Officer shall, at the Government's expense, furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including assistance in the prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment in favor to the Government in obtaining recovery.<br />4.Laws and Ordinances - The Offeror shall comply with all laws, ordinances, and regulations (Federal, State, County, City or otherwise) covering work of this character and shall include all costs, if any, of such compliance in the prices quoted in this offer.<br />K.Damage to Equipment<br />All copying equipment provided under this contract remains the property of the contractor. Therefore, the contractor assumes all responsibility for loss or damage to equipment except for loss or damage caused by negligence or willful act of the Government. For such loss or damage, the contractor may submit a claim for reimbursement of equipment repair and/or replacement costs.<br />L.Phase-In<br />The contractor will provide all resources required to ensure a smooth transition. The Government requires the maintenance of customer support with minimal interruptions/disruptions to daily operations.<br />1.The contractor shall submit, with their proposal, a plan to the COTR specifying the method in which meter reading shall be submitted by the Government.<br />2.Government personnel will be responsible for physically taking meter readings on the last business day of each month. These readings shall be provided to the contractor on or before the first business day of the next month. The readings will contain the following data: Machine serial number, meter reading, and "unusable copies" count, the number of copies used during service calls, and an authorized machine operator signature.<br />3.During the installation, the contractor must demonstrate that all CPC systems are properly working. The contractor shall provide to the government a test and acceptance plan within (10) ten days after contract award to the COTR. The demonstration must be accomplished pursuant to the operating instructions furnished with each copier and in the presence of the COTR or his/her designated representative. Upon satisfactory completion of this demonstration, the appropriate RRB personnel authorized to accept equipment under this contract will sign any acceptance document(s). The contractor shall complete testing (5) five business days before contract start date.<br />M.Phase-Out<br />The contractor shall provide all resources required to ensure a smooth transition period in accordance with contract requirements. The Government intends to sustain a maximum level of customer support during this period. The contractor agrees to the performance requirements of the contract until all of the new copiers have been installed. The contractor will be reimbursed at the contract rate for all time exceeding the contract period in which equipment must remain. The government will require the incumbent contractor to cooperate fully with the new contractor to ensure a smooth transition period. This cooperation includes, but is not limited to, tasks associated with the prompt removal of copier equipment and consumable supplies as requested by the COTR or his/her designated representative.<br />N.Uptime Efficiency Level<br />1.The contractor guarantees that each copier furnished under this contract shall achieve a minimum efficiency level of 95%. The efficiency level will be calculated on an individual machine basis by dividing the number of hours that a particular machine was operable in any month by the total number of operational hours in that month. For purpose of this contract only, the Board's printer operations schedule (workday) shall encompass the following:</p>
<p>Printer Type Hours of Operation Days of Operation</p>
<p>Remote Printers 12 hours Monday thru Friday<br />Color Printer 10 hours Monday thru Friday<br />Hi-Speed Printers (PS) 10 hours Monday thru Friday<br />Data Center Printer 24 hours Monday thru Saturday</p>
<p>Uptime efficiency will be documented on a monthly basis for all printers under this contract and will be reported during monthly service meeting with the vendor.<br />2.If a machine maintained under this contract fails to achieve the minimum required efficiency level for two (2) consecutive months, the contractor shall, upon written request by the Board, replace the under-performing machine. The replacement printer shall be delivered, installed and ready for use within ten (10) working days of contractor's receipt of the written notice. Replacement printers shall be new or remanufactured equipment in current production at the time of replacement and shall meet or exceed both the capability and contract specifications applicable to the machine being replaced. The replacement machine shall be billed at the same rate as the machine being replaced.<br />O.Credit for Excessive Downtime<br />Each printer furnished under the resulting contract shall perform at a monthly effectiveness level of 95%. The effectiveness level for the machine is computed by: the total number of hour's downtime, divided by the total production time in a month. Total productive time shall be computed by multiplying the hours of operations for each printer by the days of operations for each printer (weekends and Federal holidays excluded). If the monthly effectiveness level is 95% or higher, there is no credit due under this provision. Failure of any particular printer to achieve a monthly effectiveness of 95% shall entitle the Government to unilaterally take credit against the monthly billing for each day the equipment is inoperative. The credit shall be a percentage amount of the cost-per-copy monthly charge per machine, which shall be determined by subtracting the actual percentage of effectiveness level attained during the month from 100.<br />P.Relocation of Printers/Copiers<br />The Government reserves the right to relocate copiers furnished under the resultant contract under the following conditions:<br />1.The Contracting Officer (or his/her authorized representative) will make every effort to ensure that the contractor is provided with an accurate list of copier installations. However, during the course of the contract, copier relocations may be necessary. Therefore, any copier may be relocated (after initial installation) one (1) time per contract year at no charge to the Government. Thereafter, if that same copier is relocated, there will be no charge to the Government if RRB activity personnel do the moving, while supervised by the contractor's technical representative. If the contractor's personnel perform the relocation, it will be at the rate proposed and accepted at Section II.B, CLIN 008. Relocation of copiers will be made only by the contractor, except in cases where the contractor determines (prior to the move) that the relocation does not require trained moving technical personnel and can be performed by the RRB. This move will be limited to the RRB's headquarters facility.<br />2.The contractor shall be notified by the Contracting Officer (or his/her authorized representative) of intended equipment moves, which shall take place within 48 hours of the notification. The contractor will be provided with the new location at this time.<br />Q.Minimum Copy Guarantee<br />The Government's minimum copy guarantee shall be 10 million "dry "copies and 160,000 full color copies during the initial term of this contract. Of the 10 million "dry" copies, approximately 9.5 million will be produced on the hi-speed, hi-volume photocopiers and 500,000 will be produced on the two (2) remote printers.<br />R.Annual Reconciliation Procedures <br />Within two business weeks of the completion of each contract performance year and receipt of the last monthly invoice for that period, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) Contract Administrator (CA) and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will complete a reconciliation of Contractor copies provided against Government payments to the Contractor for those cost per copy services. The reconciliation will ensure that the Government has paid the contractor for (1) the annual minimum copies guaranteed at that cost-per-copy rate in the contract and, (2) copies provided in excess of the minimum guarantee at that specified rate. The RRB CA will then apply a credit, if any, against the final invoice for that performance year, equal to the amount of RRB payments exceeding those due to the contractor for that performance period. The RRB CA will also notify the Contractor in writing, when applying that credit for the sum of annual overpayments.<br />S.Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan<br />1.Introduction<br />The procedures established in this plan will ensure that the RRB receives the quality of service specified in the contract. Close coordination and active cooperation on a daily basis between the vendor and the COTR are necessary to obtain a quality cost-per-copy service program.<br />Under the Printer/Copier Quality Assurance Plan, the vendor must be evaluated on a monthly basis. The vendor must be evaluated in two (2) : areas Quality of Service and Customer Complaints.<br />2.Evaluation Factors<br />a.Quality of Service Provided<br />The COTR must keep a monthly performance log for each printer/copier provided under the contract. During each quarter, the COTR must notate on the Printing System Performance Log (See Attachment A) any end user and/or prime user production problems such as the following:<br />&bull; Printer/Copier excessive downtime;<br />&bull; Excessive problems with attached peripheral equipment (e.g. booklet maker, make ready workstation, finisher, etc.);<br />&bull; Consistently substandard output;<br />&bull; Non-response to maintenance issues;<br />&bull; Inadequate printer/copier supplies; and<br />&bull; Network accessibility (at the printer/copier end)<br />Any performance problems observed during each quarter of service must be documented. Performance problems must be accumulated and totaled. Copies of the Printing System Performance Log must be provided to the vendor within three (3) workdays after the end of the rating quarter in which they occur.<br />&bull; Poor - There are more than 10 performance issues documented in the Printing System Performance Log.<br />&bull; Fair - There are no more than 10 performance issues documented in the Printing System Performance Log.<br />&bull; Good - There are no more than 3 performance issues documented in the Printing System Performance Log.<br />&bull; Excellent - There are no performance issues documented in the Printing System Performance Log.<br />b. Customer Complaints<br />Customer complaints is a means by which deficiencies can be reported and serve as the basis for unsatisfactory or nonperformance of work. The COTR must record and attempt to validate each customer complaint received. Many complaints will be difficult or impossible to validate, but should still be recorded and reviewed to determine if there is a trend or pattern of complaints in the delivery of cost-per-copy services. Only complaints validated by the COTR that are not the result of operator error must be counted for performance purposes.<br />&bull;Poor - There are more than 10 validated complaints per month documented on the Printing System Complaint Log (See Attachment B).<br />&bull;Fair - There are no more than 10 documented complaints per month on the Printing System Complaint Log.<br />&bull;Good - There are no more than 3 documented complaints per month on the Printing System Complaint Log.<br />&bull;Excellent - There are no documented complaints per month on the Printing System Complaint Log.<br />A quality cost-per-copy service is the primary goal of this contract. During the life of the contract, administrative procedures such as inspection, documentation, and retention of records which reflect vendor performance are to be prepared and retained by the COTR.<br />Deductions must be taken only for illegible copies (as a result of mechanical error) and for excessive downtime (See Section III.O)<br />Poor performance is undesirable, therefore, if the vendor's performance remains less than fair and fails to adhere to the contract specifications, the contract may be canceled or terminated. The Government may also contract for the services and charge the vendor for all cost incurred by the Government.<br />Monthly meetings must be held between the vendor and/or his representative and the COTR. The purpose of the meeting must be to discuss the vendor's performance, areas of deficiencies, areas of satisfaction, and customer complaints/concerns.<br />If the vendor is non-responsive, meetings and inspections will need to be conducted more frequently. Once a more reliable service record is established, the inspections and meetings with the vendor can be reduced to normal levels.<br />T.Pre-award Survey<br />In order to determine responsibility of the Contractor, the Government reserves the right to conduct a pre-award survey of the Contractor's capability by requiring evidence of technical, production, managerial and financial capability to perform prior to the award of a contract.<br />U.Print Shop Management Proposal<br />1.General Operating Requirements<br />The RRB Print Shop is an on-sight printing facility available to all headquarters employees. Hours of operation will be 7:00 AM through 3:30 PM, Monday through Friday, except federal holidays. The RRB Print Shop is located at 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611.<br />2.Document Center Staffing Plan<br />a.The RRB Print Shop must be staffed by a minimum of one (1) full-time employee employed directly by the vendor. Temporary labor and sub-contracted labor is not acceptable for this position<br />b.Outline the staff levels, including job descriptions and position responsibilities for the RRB Print Shop.<br />c.Outline your ability to add additional employees to fill vacancy needs as they occur within the RRB Print Shop (i.e. graphic arts, peripheral machine operators.)<br />d.Describe you plans for staff coverage.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)FAR 52.209-5<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159.

<p>VI. EVALUATION AND AWARD<br />The RRB will evaluate proposals in accordance with the following FAR Clause and as specified below:<br />A. EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) FAR 52.212-2<br />(1) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most <br />advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />a. Business Proposal<br />1. The total evaluated price for each offeror shall be the total firm-fixed price offered for all services (CLINS 001-010) listed in Section II.B. <br />2. Calculation of the "price score" (100 possible points) shall be computed by multiplying the maximum point score available by a fraction representing the ratio of the lowest total evaluated price of all technically acceptable offers received by the Board to the total evaluated price of the offer being evaluated. <br />b. Technical Proposal <br />1. Calculation of the "technical score" will be accomplished by adding all points earned through objective evaluation of each proposal.<br />2. The technical factors are listed below in descending order of importance:<br />a. Equipment Offered (see section V.C.1)<br />b. Maintenance Plan (see section V.C.2)<br />c. Equipment Implementation Plan (see Section V.C.3)<br />d. Past Performance (See section V.C.4)<br />e. Uptime Efficiency (See section V.C.5)<br />f. Staff Coverage (See section V.C.6)</p>
<p>c. Evaluation Formula<br />The following formula will be used as a guide by the RRB in determining which offer is most advantageous to the RRB.<br />Total Proposal Score = (Technical Score) + (Price Score)<br />For purposes of this evaluation, the relative weighting of technical factors to price factors shall be 2:1.<br />(2) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(3) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />B. Evaluation of Options (July 1990)-Far 52.217-5<br />Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interest, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />C. General <br />1. To be considered responsive to this requirement, the offeror must comply with the format and content specified. Offerors whose proposals are deemed deficient in this regard may be permitted, at the RRB's discretion, to remedy the deficiency by submitting additional clarifying or supplemental information.<br />3. Proposals will be first reviewed for content conformance to proposal preparation instructions. Proposals which are so deficient in these areas as to not warrant further consideration will be rejected and the offeror will be so notified.<br />4.Responsive proposals will be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of each response. Accordingly, the objective of this technical evaluation is to measure the extent to which proposals meet the requirements as stated in the Statement of Work.<br />5. The Government will evaluate the proposals received and award a contract, subject to the availability of funds, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the Best Value to the Government, price and other factors (including project plan, timeline and documentation) considered. <br />VII.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by 52.212-2, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Sub factors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delivery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or sub line items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions; therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>

<p>5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005)<br />(IAW AFFARS 5301.9103)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, OC-ALC/PKC at 405 736 -3273, FAX 000 000-0000, email .

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. * Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o Terminate the contract o Recompete the requirement o Issue a new solicitation o Refrain from exercising options under the contract o Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect.<BR><BR>* Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). * Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 52.233-4703 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM 05/01/2004 If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday  Friday 7:30a.m.  4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration

<DESC>The United States Food and Drug Administration are seeking offers for the development of a quality management system for the Center of Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER's) Pharmaceutical Quality Regulatory System. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (as defined by FAR 2.101) prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A written request for proposal will not be issued. This acquisition is subject to FAR part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation) and is fixed-price. This acquisition is issued as Request for Proposal number 11-223-SOL-00031. All responsible business sources may submit an offer that will be considered. The NAICS code is 541690. The small business size standard is $7 million. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 95-48. Offers in response to this request for proposal shall be submitted by 12:00 p.m. local prevailing time, April 12, 2011. I. BACKGROUND: Food and Drug Administration's Pharmaceutical Quality Initiative for the 21st Century was introduced in 2002 to enhance and modernize the regulation of pharmaceutical manufacturing and product quality - to bring a 21st century focus to this critical FDA responsibility. The initiative is intended to modernize FDA's regulation of pharmaceutical quality for veterinary and human drugs and select human biological products (e.g., vaccines). Two of the main tenets of the initiative were to ensure that regulatory review, compliance, and inspection policies are based on state-of-the-art pharmaceutical science and to enhance the consistency and coordination of the overall FDA drug quality regulatory programs. As a result of the diligent work done under the Quality Initiative, the FDA has completed its assessment of the existing quality programs. We assessed current practices as well as available new tools of enhancing manufacturing science. Our assessment helped us create a new framework for the regulatory oversight of manufacturing quality that is based on quality systems and risk management approaches. The three parts of the drug quality regulatory programs - review, compliance, and inspection have basically worked independent of each other over the years. However, to successfully implement all tenets of the Quality Initiative, it is necessary to develop more coordinated interactions between the three areas. The roles and responsibilities of each separate section must be defined and more specific processes must be implemented, most specifically to enhance communication between the sections. Currently CDER is engaged in an effort to reach organization-wide alignment on the vision and future for the pharmaceutical quality regulatory program. Through a series of facilitated retreats, workshops, and working groups, CDER leadership has articulated the vision for regulating pharmaceutical quality and will integrate the philosophy and vision in to the business processes of the Center. In summary, CDER intends to implement a "quality management system" for regulating pharmaceutical quality. It is important to clarify the reference to a "system". The purpose of this effort is not to develop an information system and does not involve information technology/systems development. Rather, "system" in this context refers to a philosophy and a method of management designed to provide evidence that a specified standard of quality has been met and is being continuously improved. To have a successful Pharmaceutical Quality Regulatory program at CDER, it is necessary for the Center to have a "systems approach" to management of the regulation of pharmaceutical quality. In other words, CDER will only be effective and efficient in achieving the objectives of its Pharmaceutical Quality program if it identifies, understands, and manages all of the interrelated processes involved as a system. II. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this requirement is to develop a quality management approach for CDER's Pharmaceutical Quality Regulatory program. In the remainder of the SOW, we will refer to the desired approach as a "quality management system." The purpose of the procurement is to obtain subject matter expertise for developing a quality management system for regulating pharmaceutical quality. Specifically, the objectives for this effort include: 1) Evaluating the current progress toward developing a quality management system for the CDER pharmaceutical quality regulatory program and assess the current state, 2) Characterizing the desired state for a quality management system for CDER's pharmaceutical quality regulatory program; and 3) Providing recommendations and subject matter expertise to CDER leadership as the Center transitions to a quality management system. III. SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor shall: 1) Evaluate and document the Center's current state in developing a quality management system for the CDER pharmaceutical regulatory program in light of the various process improvements underway, 2) Develop and document a concept of operations which characterizes how CDER's quality management system for regulating pharmaceutical quality should operate in the desired state, 3) Document recommendations for transitioning CDER to the desired state from its current state, and 4) Provide subject matter expertise and ongoing consulting support. IV. TASKS: TASK 1: Work Plan and Meeting(s) with Project Team: The work plan shall describe the activities planned for each task, the deliverable(s), and delivery dates for the deliverable(s).

(g) Equipment- It is HHS policy that contractors shall provide all equipment and facilities necessary for performance of contracts. Exception may be granted to furnish government-owned property or to authorize purchase with contract funds, only when approved by the head of the procuring activity. If additional equipment must be acquired, the offeror shall include in your proposal the description, estimated cost of each item and whether you will furnish such items with your own funds. (h) Government-Owned Property- The offeror shall identify Government-owned property in their possession and/or property acquired from Federal funds, which you have title and that is proposed to use in the performance of the prospective contract.

If not, indicate the amount required and the anticipated source (j) Other Administrative Data, Management Capability and Responsibility. In reviewing the proposal and other sources of information, the Contracting Officer must receive adequate information to evaluate each offeror's management capability and to determine whether the offeror is responsible.

NOTE: If the information for any of the above areas has already been provided elsewhere in your proposal, please identify the section and/or page number of either your business or technical proposal where the information is located. XIV EVALUATION CRITERIA- Award will be made on a best value basis taking into account the following factors: (1) RELEVANT EXPERIENCE- a) Working knowledge of CDER Pharmaceutical Quality Initiative for the 21st Century, b) In-depth understanding of the roles and responsibilities of CDER's review, compliance, and inspection programs, c) Expertise in the pharmaceutical industry's manufacturing maturity. 2) PAST PERFORMANCE- (i) Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered. This comparative assessment of past performance information is separate from the responsibility determination required under Subpart 9.1. (ii) The solicitation shall describe the approach for evaluating past performance, including evaluating offerors with no relevant performance history, and shall provide offerors an opportunity to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement. The solicitation shall also authorize offerors to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. The source selection authority shall determine the relevance of similar past performance information. (iii) The evaluation should take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. (iv) In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. <br />(v) The evaluation should include the past performance of offerors in complying with subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns (see Subpart 19.7), monetary targets for SDB participation (see 19.1202), and notifications submitted under 19.1202-4(b) and 3)TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH. <br />XV. PRICE EVALUATION- The Price proposal shall represent the Offeror's response to the requirements of this RFP. The Government shall evaluate the total proposed price. In addition, this evaluation shall include an assessment of the Offeror's proposal for completeness, realism, reasonableness, and risk. At the Government's discretion, the Government may adjust the proposed cost to account for government-assessed cost risks. XVI. BASIS FOR AWARDS-<br />This is a best value procurement. The Government intends to award to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforms to the Scope of Work. The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal. Relevant Experience, Past Performance, and Technical and Management Approach are of equal weight and are significantly more important than Price. However, as the evaluation results of the offeror's technical and past performance areas become equivalent, price will gain greater importance in the "best value" decision. The Contracting Officer has the right to award without discussions.

<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990, with a small business size standard of $5 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This requirement is unrestricted and all interested vendors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p><br />All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) Packaging of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2684c</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>Packaging of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2684c</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background: NIST recently obtained four 55-gallon drums of bituminous coal (approximately 1400 lbs; approximately 635 kg) that requires crushing, pulverization, screening, and subsequent spin-riffling into bottles for a renewal coal SRM. New coal material was required for this renewal SRM (SRM 2684c) as reserve material for the replacement SRM had run out.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives of Procurement: The overall goal of this project is to package the coal material so that it is ready for delivery to the NIST customer. The intention is to issue the coal material as a NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM), and attaining excellent homogeneity (within the inherent limitations of heterogeneity in the processed coal matrix) during material processing is an important consideration. The specific objectives of this project require the entire lot of coal material to be crushed and pulverized followed by screening and then spin-riffle division of the entire lot into four equal portions followed by the spin riffling of one of the four portions into approximately 2500 bottles. The remaining three spin-riffled portions, each in their separate drum with liner, shall be readied for shipment to NIST. The shipping of the three drums, packaged bottles, and requested residual material will be paid for by NIST.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>1. Receive (4 drums) of 2" x 0" Bituminous Coal (approximately 1,400 lbs.) and 2880 bottles. The four drums of coal material and packaged bottles will be shipped to the Contractor from NIST.</p>
<p>2. Send all requested information (e.g., measurement data) to the NIST Contracting Officer representative (COR) via email once it is obtained.</p>
<p>3. The Government reserves the right to be present at the Contractor's site to witness the preparation and packaging. The Contractor shall notify the NIST COR of the tentative preparation and packaging schedule at least 3 business days prior to the scheduled start of the crushing of the coal so that the NIST COR can plan travel. All travel and per diem shall be conducted at NIST's expense.</p>
<p>4. Air dry gross coal sample and report the air-dried gross sample mass to the NIST COR. Then crush and pulverize the gross sample (approximately 1,400 lbs.) to 100 % passing 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) sieve. Contractor must screen material using 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) sieve, saving any plus 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) material for return to NIST in a sealed container.</p>
<p>5. Blend the approximately 1,400 lbs. by recombining opposite portions produced by the spin riffler or by an appropriate sized blender. The blending procedure must be designed to ensure that the material is well-mixed.</p>
<p>6. Spin riffle -250 &#61549;m (No. 60) mesh material into four equal splits. Prior to any additional processing, weigh each split, identify the split to be bottled (as the fourth split) and report the masses of each split to the NIST COR. The Contractor shall determine if the mass of the fourth split is suitable for providing 2500 &#61617; 300 bottles of coal material under the conditions specified in the requirements below. If the Contractor determines that they will be able to deliver between 2200 and 2800 bottles of coal, they can proceed with processing. If not, they must stop processing, and shall notify the NIST COR and the NIST Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7. Place the first three of the four equal spin riffled splits of -250 &#61549;m (No. 60) material into three separate drums, each double-lined, (each liner must be &ge; 4 mm thickness). Take one grab sample of approximately 50 g from each of the three spin-riffled drums and perform sulfur and ash measurements for an initial assessment of variability. Report the measurement data to the NIST COR. After grab samples are taken, secure each liner with zip-ties or another bag closure that minimizes any air within the bag. The coal material shall not be exposed directly to the drum.</p>
<p>8. Process the entire fourth split of approximately 350 lbs. (approximately 160 kg) of the 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) coal material by spin riffling all of this coal material into the number of sublots needed for subsequent spin riffling into 2500 &#61617; 300 bottles (must use pre-cleaned bottles and caps supplied by NIST) containing at least 50 grams each, while maintaining sufficient headspace to allow for mixing of the contents in the bottles provided.</p>
<p>9. Store (away from dust or contamination) all bottles in the containers in which they were shipped according to fill order, and identify all bottles by their sublot # and fill order number, without labeling or marking on the bottles themselves. Each sublot must represent the bottles produced in the final division by spin riffling and the number of positions in the spin riffler equals the number of bottles in each sublot of material.</p>
<p>10. After its cap has been secured, wipe clean the exterior of each filled bottle and its cap with alcohol and then package the bottles in their original containers.</p>
<p>11. Remove the first and last bottles filled and one bottle each from two different middle sublots (4 bottles total) and determine the net weight of each bottle. Then perform a screen test on the contents of each bottle at 250 &#61549;m (No. 60), with the % greater than 250 &#61549;m and the % less than 250 &#61549;m to be reported to the NIST COR, along with the net weight (prior to performing the screen test), for each bottle. Retain the residual contents of these bottles until NIST has received all of the prepared coal material (i.e., drums and filled bottles).</p>
<p>12. Remove a bottle from each sublot for S and ash measurements. Perform duplicate measurements of S and ash on each of the bottles and report all of the measurement data, for each bottle, to the NIST COR. The NIST COR will review this measurement data to determine if the material has an acceptable degree of homogeneity (as specified in the inspection and acceptance criteria below) and report back to the Contractor whether or not the material meets the homogeneity criteria within 8 calendar days of receipt of the measurement data. Retain these sublot bottles until NIST has received all of the prepared coal material (i.e., drums and filled bottles).</p>
<p>13. The packages of bottles containing the coal material from the spin riffled sublots of the fourth split, the other three spin riffled splits (in double lined drums), and any plus 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) material shall be readied for shipment to NIST. The Contractor shall notify the NIST COR of the number of bottles filled, the number of sublots, the number of bottles in each sublot, and the number of packages of bottles that will be shipped to NIST. NIST will arrange for pick-up and handle shipping costs. This will be FOB Origin, meaning the Government assumes all responsibility for shipping and pays all shipping charges. For shipping items back to NIST the Contractor shall use the NIST FEDEX account. The account number will be provided at award.</p>
<p>14. All work shall be completed, all reports on measurement data and results sent to NIST, and all material shipped to NIST, within 13 weeks of the Contractor receiving the materials. The time period for NIST to report to the Contractor on whether the material has an acceptable degree of homogeneity (8 calendar days or less) is included as part of the 13 weeks.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities:</p>
<p>NIST reserves the right to have a representative on site to observe the process.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Delivery of 2500 &#61617; 300 bottles containing at least 50 grams each.<br />2. Delivery of 3 spin-riffled splits in 3 drums.<br />3. Delivery of all material after crushing, pulverizing, and screening that remains on a 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) sieve. Return this in a sealed container of the Contractor's choice.<br />4. All measurement data reported to the NIST COR via email.<br />5. Report on the number of bottles filled, the number of sublots, the number of bottles in each sublot, and the number of packages of bottles that will be shipped to NIST.<br />6. Reports of measurement data to the Government under Contractor Requirements 4, 6, 7 and 11 are informational only and will not require COR approval.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p>1. The net mass of each bottled coal portion shall not be less than 50 g of material. <br />2. The NIST COR will inspect the bottles and drums of coal material upon arrival at NIST. Bottles will be inspected to assess whether the correct number of bottles were delivered based on what was reported and that the mass of coal in each bottle is at least 50 g with sufficient headspace to allow for mixing of the contents. The drums will be inspected to assess the correct number of drums were returned and that the coal has been spin-riffled.<br />3. In addition, acceptance of the material will be based on the results of the screening and data reported, including determination, at the 95 % confidence level, of an acceptable degree of homogeneity among the sulfur and ash sublot measurements determined by standard statistical comparisons of between- and within- bottle variability (e.g., ANOVA).</p>
<p>Government Furnished Property (GFP): Quantity/Value</p>
<p>Upon award, NIST shall provide to the Contractor:</p>
<p>1. 2880 pre-cleaned amber glass bottles and screw caps. NIST will ship 2880 amber glass bottles to the Contractor for spin-riffle bottling of the fourth split. An excess number of bottles (80) will be shipped to allow for any breakage or bottle material wastage. The value of the pre-cleaned bottles is $1900,<br />2. 4 drums of 2" x 0" Bituminous Coal (approximately 1400 lbs.). The value of the coal before processing is $1000.<br />3. The email address(es) that the Contractor shall use to contact the NIST COR and Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>The Offeror shall submit its quotation by email so that it is received at divya.soni@nist.gov no later than April 29, 2011 at 04:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: <br />The Government intends to use a tradeoff process to award a purchase order to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-cost/priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest technical rating on the non-price evaluation factors if the contracting officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of proposals, the contracting officer will review them to determine if each offeror followed all of the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation. A proposal that did not follow the proposal submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated against the factors described below.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's technical approach to determine whether the Offeror's proposed system meets all requirements detailed in the attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>B. Ability to meet federal requirements for Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) of IT Systems: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's ability to meet federal C&amp;A requirements. The Offeror must meet federal C&amp;A requirements prior to submitting a proposal to NIST.</p>
<p>C. Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the Offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. The Government will assign a neutral rating to Offerors with no relevant past performance information within the past three years or for which past performance information was reasonably unavailable. The Government may also obtain past performance information from sources other than those provided by the Offeror in its quotation to complete its evaluation of this factor.</p>
<p>D. Evaluated Price/Cost: The Government shall evaluate the reasonableness of the offerors' proposed price of the overall solution.</p>
<p>The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance. Together, Factors A, B, and C are more important than factor D. The importance of Factor D will increase with the degree of equality among quotations in the non-price factors.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>

<CONTACT>Medications Initiative for Tobacco Dependence, Phone 301-443-9800, Email NIDAMedTDWG@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><br />THIS IS NOT A CONTRACT RFP. THIS IS A GRANT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a component of the National Institutes of Health, has launched a major funding initiative to develop more effective smoking cessation medications.
<p>NIDA has issued multiple Funding Opportunity Announcements, including Medication Initiative for Tobacco Dependence (MITD): A New Product Development Partnership (PDP) (RFA-DA-11-015). MITD invites cooperative agreement applications from qualified non-profit, private, and academic organizations to form a new Product Development Partnership (PDP), which will then work to develop safe and effective medications for the treatment of tobacco dependence</p>
<p>Up to five grants will be awarded for Phase One, the planning phase. Grantees will study the feasibility of novel smoking cessation medications and recommend specific private-public collaborations necessary to successfully support research efforts aimed at development and evaluation of new medications. The ultimate goal of this phase is the establishment of the PDP.</p>
<p>Phase Two funding will support a wide array of research and development projects to fulfill the regulatory requirements for approval and marketing in the US. The Phase Two awardee is likely to be chosen from among the Phase One grantees.</p>
<p>NIDA intends to commit an estimated $500,000 for Phase One and another $10 million for Phase Two.</p>
<p>Other NIDA funding announcements to support the development of new medications for tobacco dependence include the 2011 NIDA Translational Avant-Garde Award for Medication Development for Diseases of Addiction (PAR -11-102), 2011 NIDA Translational Avant-Garde Award for Medication Development for Diseases of Addiction (RFA-DA-11-009), Predictive Animal Models for Smoking Cessation Medications (RFA-DA-014) . Both non-profit and for-profit institutions are eligible to apply.</p>
<p><br />Background: Tobacco smoking is linked to more than 400,000 deaths occurring each year in the United States, and is expected, worldwide, to contribute to over 1 billion premature deaths over the next century. Despite considerable public health efforts, millions remain addicted; the smoking rate has remained unchanged at approximately 20 percent since 2004. Among those trying to quit, the vast majority relapse within 6 months.</p>

<p>52.209-8 Updates of Information Regarding Responsibility Matters. (APR 2010)(a) The Contractor shall update the information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) on a semi-annual basis, throughout the life of the contract, by entering the required information in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). (b)(1) The Contractor will receive notification when the Government posts new information to the Contractor's record. (2) The Contractor will have an opportunity to post comments regarding information that has been posted by the Government. The comments will be retained as long as the associated information is retained, i.e., for a total period of 6 years. Contractor comments will remain a part of the record unless the Contractor revises them. (3) With the exception of the Contractor, only Government personnel and authorized users performing business on behalf of the Government will be able to view the Contractor's record in the system. Public requests for system information will be handled under Freedom of Information Act procedures, including, where appropriate, procedures promulgated under E.O. 12600.(End of clause)<br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>

(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. (iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in- (A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or (B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. (iv) In a <br />criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. (2) If the offeror has been involved in the last <br />five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. (d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http:// www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). "Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>This modification extends the closing date of this combined synopsis/solicitation to Monday, March 14 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time.&nbsp; All responses are due by this date and time.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This synopsis, NAICS code 541611, identified as FDA1084061, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following specifications, under the simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will only be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>1.1 Background<br /><br />The ORA/ORO/Division of Federal-State Relations (DFSR) is responsible for oversight of State contract inspections. Currently, FDA conducts program assessment validation audits (hereafter known as audits) using the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) (OMB control number 0910-0601) to determine how State food inspection programs compare to FDA's food inspection program.</p>
<p>The current DFSR staffing level does not provide for the level of expertise needed to conduct these audits. Due to competing priorities, DFSR is unable to hire and train permanent staff without causing delays in completing the audits.</p>
<p>1.2 Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of the contract is to strengthen and expand State food inspection programs. The MFRPS audits will identify elements within the State's food inspection program that need improvement.</p>
<p>1.3 Project Scope</p>
<p>This contract will provide experienced personnel to conduct and document audits of states that are implementing the MFRPS.</p>
<p>2.0 Description of Work<br /><br />The Contractor shall audit State food inspection programs against Federal Government standards including but not limited to the MFRPS.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct 12 on-site audits of the State food inspection programs in the following states: AL, CO, GA, KS, MS, OK, RI, TX, VA, VT, WV, and WY. The number of days to complete the audit may vary but will not exceed five days (including travel days). The dates and exact locations of the audits will be determined by the DFSR.</p>
<p>The Contractor will participate in pre-audit meetings and conference calls if necessary.</p>
<p>3.0 Task Deliverables and Milestones</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use worksheets provided by the Government to determine if a state has partially or fully implemented the MFRPS.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall summarize audit findings and provide a report to the Government within five (5) working days after the conclusion of the audit. The Contractor shall revise the report if needed.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall review and edit the final audit report if requested.</p>
<p>Prepare all documents typed in 8 &frac12; x 11 letter format within the period of performance. All documents are to be submitted in electronic form and in the native file format of MS Word 2000 or a later version of that software.</p>
<p>4.0 Period of Performance: One year from date of award.</p>
<p>5.0 Location, Work Schedule, and Travel</p>
<p>The Contractor shall comply with the deadlines set forth in this contract. Work will be performed off-site.</p>
<p>6.0 Security and Privacy</p>
<p>It is not anticipated that the Contractor will be exposed to sensitive Agency information or data. But, the Contractor agrees that contract personnel will not divulge or release information or data developed or obtained in connection with performance of this contract, unless made public by FDA or upon written approval by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>7.0 Contractor Conformance with Applicable Laws, Regulations, Policies, and Standards</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for knowledge of and compliance with all applicable federal information technology and information management laws, regulations, policies and standards at the government-wide, HHS, and FDA levels. At the government-wide level, these include Office of Management and Budget (OMB), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and General Accounting Office (GAO). These can be primarily found at or through the Federal CIO Council website at: http://www.cio.gov. HHS documents are found at http://www.cdc.gov/irmo</p>
<p>8.0 Payment Terms</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit the cost per audit (include on-site audit, documenting audit findings, and review and revise final audit report).</p>
<p>For each 90-day period of the contract (based upon the performance period), a Quarterly Summary Report (Form FDA 2684) of the audits and travel expenses shall be prepared. Included with the report shall be the contract number, a list of audits completed specifying the name and city of the state agency, and audit dates. In those periods where no audits were performed, a report showing no audits is required.</p>
<p>A proper invoice is required. Invoices will be approved at the negotiated rate along with submittal of the Quarterly Summary Report. Invoices will not be approved without the Quarterly Summary Report. Therefore, timely submission is critical to expedite voucher/invoice processing and payment. Payment will be made after the deliverables are reviewed by DFSR.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p><br />The intent of this requirement is to procure program management, systems engineering and technical support to ensure continuity of effort and provide support to 50th Space Wing Plans and Programs Office (50 SW/XP) planning and programming personnel. Services to be provided by this requirement include, but are not limited to the following: Program management and system engineering support; Wing Compliance and Self-Inspection Program Support; Wing Operational Plan Development; Wing host/tenant base planning and integration to include Wing Operations; Wing Budget Preparation; System Integration of Short-Term Special Projects; Mission sustainment and future program planning; Wing Operational Requirements Development and Coordination. This requirement will provide scientific and engineering technical services to the 50 SW/XP. The 50 SW/XP Office is chartered to provide future planning to support the 50th Space Wing (50 SW) mission and for 50 SW bases and units and acts as the Wing's "front door" providing initial and continuing support to external agencies. The term "front door" means the 50 SW/XP office is the single point of entry, the only source, into the 50 SW for requests for any future planning support requirements. The 50 SW/XP also provides requirements validation, system integration and planning support for Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), satellite command and control systems and 50 SW users. The contractor shall provide support to all aspects of 50 SW/XP operations.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program management office (PMO) or contracting officer (CO), but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman can be reached at Headquarters Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC) A7K, 719-554-5250.<br /><br />UPDATE 4 Feb 2011<br />The Government has determined that NAICS code 541330 size standard exception for "Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons" applies to this acquisition. The NAICS code remains 541330 - Engineering Services, however, the size standard has changed from $4.5M to $27M.</p>
<p>UPDATE 11 Mar 2011<br />As part of the acquisition planning process, an Initial Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Analysis has been conducted by the Contracting Officer. As a result of this analysis, the Government has identified several areas of the SORTIES requirement which could potentially be areas for OCI concerns. Attached is a "Memorandum for Potential Interested Offerors" dated 11 March 2011. Interested parties should review that memorandum. Although the final acquisition strategy has not yet been approved, the Contracting Officer intends to request that all offerors provide an OCI analysis and mitigation plan, to include the items discussed in the memorandum as part of their proposals. This memorandum is published for planning purposes only and IS NOT a request for proposal or a request for any other information from industry at this time.</p>

<DESC>ATTACHED IS A DRAFT OF AN OCI CLAUSE SIMILAR TO WHAT WILL BE IN THE GLOBAL TACTICAL ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS (GTACS) SOLICITATION, AND SIMILAR TO THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) CLAUSE THAT WILL APPEAR IN MOST SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (SETA) SUPPORT CONTRACTS.<br>  <br>BECAUSE OF THE BROAD SCOPE OF THE GTACS CONTRACT AND SITUATIONS WHERE POTENTIAL OFFERORS CURRENTLY PROVIDE SETA SUPPORT SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT(S) OF INTEREST TO DEVELOP SUCH AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 9.5.<br>  <br>EACH OFFEROR SHOULD REVIEW FAR 9.5 AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE EXTENT WHICH SUCH AN OCI MAY ARISE BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION TO COMPETE FOR THE GTACS EFFORT.<br>  <br>H-1 52.6001 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST / MARCH 2011<br> <br>Specific fill-in information will be provided as appropriate on a Task Order basis.<br><br>(a) Definition.<br>Per FAR 2.101, an organizational conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the persons objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. It does not include the normal flow of benefits from incumbency.<br><br>(b) The Contracting Officer has determined that potentially significant organizational conflicts of interest may arise due to the nature of the work the Contractor will perform under this contract that may preclude the Contractor from being awarded future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts in a related area. Whereas the Contractor shall be ineligible to act as a prime contractor, consultant, or subcontractor to provide the equipment, items and services, it is agreed that the Contractor shall be ineligible to act as a prime contractor, consultant, or subcontractor to any prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier who is to supply the services, system or major components thereof for any project where the Contractor has provided or is providing support as described in FAR 9.5.<br><br>(c) The Contracting Officer may make a determination to allow a Contractor to participate in an acquisition subject to the submission of an acceptable mitigation plan in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) below. This determination may not be appealed.<br><br>(1) If the Contracting Officer requests, and the Contractor submits an organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan that, after Government review is acceptable to the Government, the Contractor's parent corporation, subsidiaries, or other physically separate profit and loss centers may not be precluded from acting as a subcontractor or consultant on future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts. The Government's determination regarding the adequacy of the mitigation plan or the possibility of mitigation are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the Government and are not subject to the Disputes clause of the contract. The Government may terminate the contract for default if the Contractor fails to implement and follow the procedures contained in any approved mitigation plan.<br><br>(2) Any mitigation plan shall include, at a minimum, non-disclosure agreements to be executed by the Contractor and the Contractors employees supporting the Government per paragraph (c) above. Items for consideration in a mitigation plan include the following: identification of the organizational conflict(s) of interest; reporting and tracking system; an organizational conflict of interest  compliance/enforcement plan, to include employee training and sanctions, in the event of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information; a plan for organizational segregation (e.g., separate reporting chains); and data security measures.<br><br>(d) These restrictions outlined in paragraph (b) shall apply to   - FILL IN --.  This clause shall remain in effect for one year after completion of this contract.<br><br>(e) The Contractor shall apply this clause to any subcontractors or consultants, who have access to information, participate in the development of data, or participate in any other activity related to this contract which is subject to terms of this clause at the prime contractor level, unless the Contractor includes an acceptable alternate subcontractor provision in its mitigation plan. For subcontractors or consultants under this contract, if an organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan is submitted and acceptable to the Government, the subcontractor's parent corporation, subsidiaries, or other physically separate profit and loss centers may not be precluded from acting as a prime, subcontractor, or consultant on future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts.<br><br>(f) The Contractor's employees shall be trained and informed of Subpart 9.5 of the FAR and this contract provision, and shall execute a Contractor-Employee Personal Financial Interest/Protection of Sensitive Information Agreement as appropriate.<br><br>(g) The Contactor agrees that it will use all reasonable diligence in protecting proprietary data received by it. The Contractor further agrees it will not willfully disclose proprietary data to unauthorized parties without the prior permission of the Government, and that proprietary data shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed, in whole or part, for any purpose other than to accomplish the contracted effort. This restriction does not limit the contractors right to use, duplicate or disclose such information if such information was lawfully obtained by the contractor from other sources.<br>  <br>(h) The Contractor agrees to enter into written agreements with all companies whose proprietary data it shall have access and to protect such data from unauthorized use or disclosure as long as it remains proprietary. The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer copies of these written agreements. The Contractor agrees to protect the proprietary data and rights of other organizations disclosed to the Contractor during performance of this contract with the same caution that a reasonably prudent Contractor would use to safeguard highly valuable property. The Contractor agrees to refrain from using proprietary information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.<br><br>(i) The Contractor shall not distribute reports, data or information of any nature arising from its performance under this contract, except as provided by this contract or as may be directed by the Contracting Officer.<br><br> (j) Government Representatives shall have access to the Contractors premises and the right to inspect all pertinent books and records in order to insure that the contractor is in compliance with FAR 9.5.<br><br>(k) The Contractor agrees that if after award it discovers a potential organizational conflict of interest, a prompt and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of the actions the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.<br><br>(l) The Government may waive application of this clause when it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to do so.<br><br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information.  <br>Contracting Office: <br> <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND (C4ISR)<br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                 Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist              Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief   Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

<p>The NCI, ARP/RFMMB is seeking support in maintaining and enhancing the ASA24 Version1 (V1 - to be released Summer 2011), a web-based self-administered 24-hour dietary recall system freely available to clinicians and researchers. To perform the requirements of the project, the Contractor must possess sufficient technical and operational capabilities necessary for updating the question/food and food, nutrient, and dietary supplement databases on a yearly or bi-annual basis; identifying and fixing software bugs; completing scalability testing and adjustment; providing user support; creating a system for monitoring/tracking software versions and studies using the software; and performing software enhancements.</p>
<p>Summary of Project: The purpose of the anticipated requirement is to provide support and enhancement to the ASA24 V1&nbsp;System. The Contractor must be able to complete tasks in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Update, Maintain, and Provide User Support for the ASA24 System. The Contractor shall update and maintain the ASA24 system, including Researcher and Respondent User software and Websites, to reflect the most current, up-to-date Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Access to the most current, up-to-date version of AMPM will be provided to the Contractor by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Contractor shall perform technical tasks including, but not limited to the analysis of AMPM data to determine the frequency with which probes are used and how a sequence of probes links to food codes, modification of wording to be user friendly consistent with the current ASA24 system, and the update or transfer of new foods and questions/probes into the ASA24 system. Updates to all food, nutrient and supplement databases and associated question sets and analytic programs will be required. In addition, the Contractor shall also update all down-loadable and web-based content on the ASA24 system, including Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and documentation of analytic programs for nutrients, food groups, supplements, and other data elements to reflect user feedback and the current updated version of the ASA24 Respondent and Researcher software. Finally, the Contractor shall provide user support by tracking and responding to user issues, concerns, and questions.</p>
<p>&bull; ASA24 Administration and Versioning. In addition to maintaining the existing system capability of assigning roles and deleting Users, the Contractor shall create a tool or system to track, maintain, and manage usage of multiple versions of the ASA24 System. This tool should allow current users to maintain the status quo or upgrade to the most current version, based on preference. Versions may differ based on updates to nutrient/food group/supplement databases, updates to the Graphic User Interface (GUI), and updates for a country-specific version.</p>
<p>&bull; Enhancements of the ASA24 Respondent Website. In addition to maintaining the existing V1&nbsp;system, the Contractor shall add new features to the GUI possibly&nbsp;including the addition of more animation/movement to&nbsp;an existing animated agent to better guide respondents. The Contractor shall also create at least two additional agent characters to add interest to the software, and shall update and improve the tutorial and help systems as needed. Updates and maintenance of the current search system will be ongoing, as are&nbsp;updates of the existing food list used for browsing, to improve usability. Additional features that require development are the addition of a "Favorites" function allowing Respondent Users to create a list of foods they designate as commonly consumed that would be available to them upon subsequent administrations of ASA24, a salt module similar to how questions are asked in NHANES, a source module that queries regarding the source of all foods consumed, validation checks, and adaptations for children.</p>
<p>&bull; Enhancement of the ASA24 Researcher Website. The ASA24 System includes a website to register Researcher Users. The Contractor will be responsible for improving the process for registering studies, including the import of files, validation of import files, the generation of passwords for Respondent Users, and the creation of study-specific logos. The Contractor shall also improve the display for respondent tracking, sorting of respondent identifiers, analytic modules for nutrients, food groups and supplements, and provide options for automated reports and updates for Researcher Users. The Contractor shall also provide ongoing support and trouble shooting for Researcher Users and shall continuously monitor all websites and website documents to be up-to-date and accurate.</p>
<p>&bull; General/Administrative Tasks. The Contractor shall plan to attend all meetings, manage the costs and deliverables for the contract and document all software and website specifications, including a log of changes, updates and decisions. All source code would need to be available to the Government within 2 weeks of any request.</p>
<p>The Contractor may also be required to complete the following additional tasks:</p>
<p>&bull; Create a tool which would provide an automated means to update and maintain the ASA24 probe database to support the creation of country or study-specific versions with tailored probes, food terms, portion photographs, languages, and nutrient databases. <br /><br />&bull; Develop a Canadian version of ASA24 that includes modifications of food probes and databases specific to a Canadian population;<br /><br />&bull; Explore and develop specifications to create a version of the ASA24 Respondent Website that is accessible on a "smart phone" for use in research and potentially by members of the general public to obtain information about their diets; <br /><br />&bull; Develop a version of ASA24 Respondent Website that is accessible on a "smart phone" for use in research and potentially by members of the general public to obtain information about their diets; <br /><br />&bull; Add a feature on the ASA24 Respondent Website to allow respondents to report recipes and their intakes of foods made from these recipes for all ASA24 System versions; and<br /><br />&bull; Create an application on the ASA24 Researcher Website by which researchers can create customizable reports in both the Spanish and English languages to send to their Respondent Users.</p>
<p>DURATON: It is anticipated that the project will be completed in 60 months. Additionally, the NCI may reserve the right to exercise two options years, which would extend the period of performance by an additional 12 or 24 months.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY CRITERIA: Capabilities will be judged based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1) Understanding the Problem: The development and use of self-reported dietary assessment is an important, active research area. Demonstration of knowledge of the complexities of various methods, available data systems and how they might be operationalized in a self-reported dietary software system requiring constant updating and versioning is necessary.

<DESC>This 11 March 2011 notice is being issued to provide Release #3 - Questions/Answers&nbsp;that have been received in response to the Draft RFP for the GSM-ETI effort.&nbsp; All questions received in response to the Draft RFP have been responded to.<br /><br />Release #3 - Questions/Answers<br /><br />QUESTION #148: I spoke with Katie Prisuta this morning. She verified that the CD is classified at the SECRET level, so we do need a DD254 indicating that safeguarding is required in order to pick it up. Will you call the contracting officer again?<br /><br />1. The vendor holds a Top Secret facility clearance and while we have a facility capable of holding classified material, we do not currently have authority to receive and safeguard classified material.<br />2. In order to store the classified CD required for GSM-ETI, we need a DD-254 that provides the vendor with the authority to receive and safeguard Secret material. The current DRAFT DD-254 in the solicitation is marked<br />DRAFT, is not signed, and is not directed to the vendor. DSS will not accept this document as authority for the vendor to receive and safeguard Secret material.<br />3. The NISPOM requires that the Government provide prospective bidders with a DD-254 in order to store classified material associated with an acquisition.<br />4. The vendor is requesting a signed DD-254 from DITCO so that we can request DSS to certify our storage room and receive classified material associated with this program.<br />ANSWER #148: According to DISA Industrial Security, the updated DD254 (provided as attachment to this FedBizOpps notices) is sufficient to allow the vendors/contract awardee(s) to process appropriate paperwork to DSS to allow receipt and storage of classified materials
<p><br />QUESTION #149: Request clarification to answer provided at #88; where the Government stated that the P&amp;S source (to be provided via existing GSA Alliant sources) will be used for support capabilities that are functional niche type work (e.g. training services, cryptographic support, software development). Will the COMSEC role in P&amp;S be primarily administrative and, as such, tie closely with work in support of the DISN Controlling Authority; or will the P&amp;S role for COMSEC be much greater to include not only the administrative, but also include COMSEC engineering, key management, secure storage of encryptors, cradle to grave support to CCI units, deployment and implementation support, etc.? Suggest that the Government reconsider revising the GSM-ETI SOO to include the latter the engineering, key management, secure storage of encryptors, cradle to grave support to CCI units, deployment and implementation support and leave the administrative work in support of the DISN Controlling Authority with the P&amp;S source.</p>
<p>ANSWER #149: The GSM P&amp;S vehicle will be used for COMSEC support to the controlling authority, to include training, key management, and storage. The GSM-O vehicle will be used to support the maintenance of crypto devices and the GSM-ETI vehicle will be used to support engineering and installation of new crypto devices (when associated with build-out events that fall under the auspices of a GSM-ETI project).</p>
<p>&nbsp;A revised DD 254 is provided as an attachment to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - St. Paul District intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the Devils Lake Flood Risk Management Phase 2B Embankments / East Ditch Pump Station construction project. The project will provide flood protection to the city of Devils Lake, North Dakota.<br /><br />Project work consists of, but is not limited to, furnishing all plant labor, material and equipment to raise the existing embankments along Devils Lake from elevation 1461.2 to 1468.2 (1467.2 design elevation plus 1' additional for settlement) for a reach beginning on the east side of town just south of Highway 2 and continuing along the existing embankment to the west for approximately 8,700 feet as well as a separate reach beginning at the intersection of HWY 20 and the existing embankment and continuing along the existing embankment to the northeast for approximately 4,800 feet, construct a new interior drainage pump station/gatewell (cofferdam construction required), remove existing gatewell (cofferdam construction required), and demolish existing pump station. The embankments will have up to 12 feet (approx.) of differential head across them. The construction contractor will be required to excavate into the existing embankment and also into the subsurface materials beyond the dryside toe of the existing embankment. In some instances, the subsurface materials beyond the dryside toe of the embankment will be soft and saturated. The construction contractor will be required to monitor and maintain the stability of the existing embankment throughout the duration of the project. Shoring and sheeting of excavation areas will be required in certain defined locations. The main components of the project are: clearing, stripping, excavation of existing flood protection embankment, common excavation, placement of new impervious embankment fill &amp; sand drain, riprap slope protection and pump station construction. <br /><br />This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement. The estimated price range is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990. The small business size standard is $33.5 million.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the agency. The tentative date for opening bids is&nbsp;11&nbsp;April 2011. The estimated date for completing contract performance is 30 November 2012.<br /><br />It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor this site for the solicitation and amendments.

<CONTACT>Michael A. Douglas, Contracting Officer, Phone (979) 260-9480, Fax (979) 260-9413, Email michael.douglas@ars.usda.gov
<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>AG-7MN1-P-11-0012
<DESC>The USDA, ARS, Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestick Insects Research Laboratory, Kerrville, Texas intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 to Amplicon Express, 2345 NE Hopkins Court, Pullman, WA 99163. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) - a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major database that will have significant impact on our research goal of obtaining the genome sequence to the Boophilus microplus cattle tick.
<p>Amplicon Express synthesized and are storing our 2 current BAC libraries (which consist of 193,000 clones and 504-384 well plates). Amplicon Express also has in their possession, from their original library synthesis for us, the prepared genomic DNA from the Deutsch strain of Boophilus microplus ticks that is necessary for synthesizing new libraries, should these be required. The tick material from this strain is in low supply and the material is needed for several other purposes in our laboratory. By using the prepared material which Amplicon Express has saved from the previous library, we save precious Deutsch tick strain material for other research needs.</p>
<p>The following is the minimum work required: We require focused genome sequencing with Illumina runs, bioinformatic assembly, and tech support for genome sequencing of BACs from a BAC library synthesized from Boophilus microplus genomic DNA from the Deutch strain of Boophilus microplus. Clones are to be systematically pooled using 18,432 BAC clones (9,216 from each of two preexisting BAC libraries), Illumina grade BAC DNA prepared from a series of 368 pooled BAC samples, 368 Illumina libraries prepared, ~30 Gbp of Illumina sequencing generated from the libraries, deconvolution analysis performed and a superpool of ALL 18,432 BAC clones and a ~3 Kb Mate Pair library made and one Illumina channel run. All of these data must be assembled and after evaluating initial results, 96 primers at gap frontiers will be designed and used to Sanger sequence the appropriate BAC clone(s) DNA directly for gap closure. We are requesting that Amplicon Express conduct this BAC library focused genome sequencing project because they were the company that synthesized and are storing our 2 current BAC libraries (which consist of 193,000 clones and 504-384 well plates). Amplicon Express also has in their possession, from their original library synthesis for us, the prepared genomic DNA from the Deutsch strain of Boophilus microplus ticks that is necessary for synthesizing new libraries, should these be required. The tick material from this strain is in low supply and the material is needed for several other purposes in our laboratory. By using the prepared material which Amplicon Express has saved from the previous library, we save precious Deutsch tick strain material for other research needs. This pooled BAC focused genome sequencing is proprietary technology developed by Amplicon Express, and only recently made available to the general scientific community. This technology will enable us to produce a draft physical map of the cattle tick genome, using the BACs as source material.</p>
<p>The current BAC library clones which are the foundation of this project are stored at Amplicon Express and, by using Amplicon Express to do this genome sequence project, we prevent having to ship these unique and very expensive BAC libraries to a different location. These BAC libraries must remain frozen at -80 degrees C to maintain long term viability. Off-site shipment risks the libraries will thaw during shipment or the plastic library plates that hold the individual clones arrayed in a known pattern might be broken.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact above not later than 3:00pm CST on March 25, 2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. No RFQ will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Michael Douglas, Contract Specialist at the email address listed above with the solicitation number referenced in the subject line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>Washington Headquarters Services<br />Acquisition and Procurement Office<br />Professional Services and Studies Division<br />1700 North Moore Street, Suite 1425<br />Arlington, VA 22209</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action.</p>
<p>Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (and subsequently the Military Commissions Act of 2009) to provide a legal basis for prosecuting detainees at Guantanamo Bay by military commissions for violations of the law of war. Hundreds of alleged terrorists were transferred to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. To successfully try alien unprivileged enemy belligerents for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commissions, the Office of Military Commissions (OMC) requires a qualified contractor to provide court room technology support services. This support includes qualified court room technology staff to operate, maintain, and advise on court room technology installed at OMC court rooms in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>The predominant clearance level of the above services is Top Secret-Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI). Performance of these services will take place in Washington, DC and at the Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Federal statute, OMC is responsible for the trial of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay who are charged with serious criminal offenses. These trials are a matter of national importance, and defendants must be brought to trial.</p>
<p>3. Description of the Required Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The Court Room XXI system must have a highly qualified Broadcast Audio/Video Engineer, Audio/Video System Design and Audio/Video Operator/Installer to operate and maintain the Courtroom XXI legal technology system installed at the Expeditionary Legal Complexes at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The system is a complex fully integrated electronics system consisting of video teleconference equipment, audio recording technology, broadcasting equipment, integrated capture capability, translation services, evidence capturing equipment and an array of IR headphones that provide translation capability in five different languages. All of these services are fully integrated into server suites/control room that integrate the system into a single operator maintained Court Room XXI system. This contract provides service to maintain and operate the Court Room XXI system for a base year from February 2011 to February 2012 and one option year. This period of performance is needed in order to ensure the continued functioning of the systems in the event OMC is presented with trials.</p>
<p>The majority of the work to be preformed will be in the area of emergency assistance for the resolution of technical issues experienced with the existing technical courtroom system. OMC requires these expert services and the highest confidence to know that any failure in courtroom operations will be immediately resolved with minimal disruption to court proceedings. The two courtrooms in Guantanamo are the only courtroom of their kind in the world. Delays in court proceedings due to system down time will cause significant costs to the Government for contractors and personnel to be on standby. The courtroom has SCIFed accreditation, technical issues could jeopardize the continued accreditation of this facility with the regulatory agencies which set strict requirements for its continued SCIF accreditation Currently, the courtroom systems comply with all Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) requirements for SCIF accreditation.</p>
<p>4. Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition <br /><br />OMC has a "no fail" mission. Currently, there is only one entity that can ensure the continuous and flawless operation of the Courtroom XXI equipment. That entity is the Center for Legal and Court Technology (CLCT) at the William and Mary Law School. CLCT previously planned, the hardware and software architecture, installed, and operated and maintained the two Courtroom XXI systems in Guantanamo. CLCT previously operated the two unique systems that OMC owns. Due to the "no fail" mission of OMC and their unequalled knowledge of the OMC Courtroom XXI system, CLCT is the only entity to award this contract to at this time. If CLCT is not awarded this contract, the Courtroom XXI system may experience technical issue(s) or failure that another vendor will not be able to immediately fix due to their inexperience with the Courtroom XXI system. Most importantly, delays in a trial may result in unnecessary costs incurred by the Government. Deep substantive understandings of this unique courtroom and the unique security challenges are a necessity.</p>
<p><br />5. Estimated Dollar Value:</p>
<p>The estimated total dollar value of the base year contract is not to exceed $200,000, but if option <br />period one is required and exercised, may approach but not exceed $400,000.</p>
<p>6. Statutory Authority:</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) and FAR 6.302-3, Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services.</p>
<p>7. Demonstration of the Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications:</p>
<p>This uninterrupted service is required to ensure the provision of efficient and effective trial proceedings. Given the high visibility of Commissions trials, past experience, on-going knowledge of real world concerns, and expert consulting services only CLCT of the College of William and Mary's Law School possesses the integrated history of the systems design for the courtroom in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to provide the necessary emergency assistance for the resolution of technical issues experienced with the existing technical courtroom system. OMC requires a contractor for assurance that any failure in courtroom presentations and operations will be immediately resolved with minimal disruption to court proceedings. The combine knowledge and proprietary expertise of CLCT of the College of William and Mary's Law School make them uniquely qualified to meet this Government requirement. Currently, they are the incumbent that developed and is supporting this endeavor and this logical follow-on contract will ensure uninterrupted services with any future trial proceedings.</p>
<p>8. Description of Efforts Made to Provide for Future Competition:</p>
<p>The period for the sole source has been limited to the shortest possible duration required to complete the tasks specified above. It is anticipated that the base year is sufficient to accomplish the stated goals and potentially gain the expertise within the Government.</p>
<p>9. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost:</p>
<p>WHS A&amp;PO will determine Price Fairness and Reasonableness by reviewing the contractor's price proposal in accordance with procedures for negotiations with a nonprofit educational institution. Additionally, market research will be conducted to compare labor rates with comparable rates held by Federal Schedule holders, other public pricing information available and historical pricing. <br /><br />10. Description of Market Research Conducted:</p>
<p>The anticipated award will be made to a nonprofit educational institution that possess the proprietary knowledge and expertise through creating the hardware and software architecture of the existing courtroom systems. A dynamic web search for competition for Courtroom XXI yielded negative results that could possibly offer a similar court support solution for OMC at this time. The market research resulted in articles highlighting William and Mary as being on the cutting edge of virtual courtroom research and systems. CLCT at the William and Mary Law School is the only viable source that posses the expertise necessary to support OMC. Bringing another contractor out to GITMO that is not familiar with the Courtroom XXI system would be detrimental at this point. Although other contractors have the necessary and the appropriate clearances; having them on board would be costly and a duplication of efforts. The immediate need requires someone on standby with the necessary knowledge to alleviate downtime as related to court technology and unique GTMO issues and to help keep the system running and current.</p>
<p><br />11. Other Facts Supporting this Acquisition:</p>
<p>In the event the courtroom is not fully operable, trials will not be conducted in a timely manner and can potentially lead to dismissal, which could result in the release of potentially dangerous individuals and would pose a threat to the security of the United States and its citizens.</p>
