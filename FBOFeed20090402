<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to procure additional work via a sole-source modification to Contract 07-CR-40-8185 with Keller-Bliesner Engineering.  The purpose of the contract at inception was to perform special studies and analyses on the impact of Glen Canyon Dam operations on endangered fish species in the San Juan River Basin on Navajo Nation land.  Due to lack of sufficient collected data and to strengthen findings of work performed to date, the Government requires another season of data collection.  This will provide the necessary data required to effectively assist the Government to properly manage the impact on endangered fish and to ensure the Government's uninterrupted operations in the San Juan River Basin.
The additional workscope to be procured will involve scientific sampling of two complex reaches along the San Juan River once in August 2009 during base flow for young endangered fishes.  Combined with sample data to be collected in the Spring of 2009, reports on habitat mapping, interpretation and analysis of data, and integration of fish sampling and habitat data will be delivered in the Spring of 2010.  The period of performance will end on June 30, 2010.  The basis of the sole-source procurement, per FAR 6.302-1, is that the current contractor is the only one that can properly continue the analysis and integration of data accumulated since contract inception, and that awarding to any other contractor would adversely compromise scientific data integral to the Government's efforts to mitigate dam operations on endangered species.  Additionally, only contractors with permits granted by the Navajo Nation are allowed to perform scientific research on its properties.  The Government does not intend to procure the same services after June 2010.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC><p><br />This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a), to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals for a "full and open" competitive acquisition for a project titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children's Health Study</span> (CHS). The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the Government's objectives for this acquisition. Offerors responding to the solicitation (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it is released</span>) will be responsible for developing and submitting their own Statement of Work (SOW) based upon the objectives contained in the attached draft SOO.</p>
<p><br />The contracting officer's "full and open" acquisition strategy decision is based upon the Government's evaluation of capability statements received in response to a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) posted to FEDBIZOPS on 2/17/2009. The Government will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> accept or consider additional capability statements at this time because the market research phase has ended.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOO, this notice also includes questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI) posted on 11/21/ 2008 and the Government's responses. The attachment was previously posted with the aforementioned SSS and is provided again as a convenience to those interested offerors who may be unfamiliar with the "history" of this acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No response to this notice is requested or required.</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. The contracting officer will request proposals when the solicitation is posted to FEDBIZOPS some time after this 15-day mandatory, preliminary notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Government anticipates making a single contract award for a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type contract. The rough order magnitude (ROM) of the contemplated contract is between $100Million to $150Million. As explained in the attached draft SOO, the resulting contract will consist of two phases: (1) A two-year Feasibility Study and (2) a six-year Full Study phase.</p>
<p><br />Any questions regarding this notice must be in writing to the contracting officer via email: ftg7@cdc.gov prior to the expiration date of this notice.</p>

This Contract is an IQC Type Contract with One (01) 3-Year Base Period [Firm Fixed Price], Two (02) Two-Year Option Periods [1st: Fixed Price/EPA; 2nd: Corporate Contracting Price Redetermination - Alternate I]; and One (01) 3-year Option Period [Corporate Contracting Price Redetermination - Alternate I].

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement to build a second Global Precipitation Measurement(GMI) instrument that has a 13-channel total power radiometer whose core science measuresthe Earths atmospheric moisture.  The 13 science channels must cover a range of 10.65GHzthrough 183.31GHz in the microwave spectrum; and produce NEdeltaT between 0.57K to 1.5K. The instrument shall employ a conically scanning 1.2 meter dish antenna that rotates withthe instrument at a rate of approximately 30 RPM.  The instrument must have a mass of160.5 kg, the power must be 162 Watts, and its deployed volumetric envelope is 1.45meters in diameter by 3.0 meters in height. The instrument must maintain a 38 month lifeexpectancy after launch.NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the second instrument from Ball Aerospace & TechnologyCorporation (BATC) as a sole source procurement. The original GMI contract was awarded toBATC on March 22, 2005 as a full and open competition to develop one Flight Unit with anoption to buy a second flight unit one year later. To achieve full potential of the GPMmission it is paramount that the two instruments on the Core and Low InclinationSpacecrafts must be identical in performance.  Since BATC is currently under contract todevelop the first GMI flight unit for the Core Spacecraft, they are uniquely suited toproduce the second instrument for Low Inclination Spacecraft.  The second flightinstrument is needed in late 2012 to support the Low Inclination Spacecraft launch.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon April 17, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an integral part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and its mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes. To accomplish this, NHTSA collects and analyzes motor vehicle crash data and develops, promotes, and implements educational programs, vehicle safety standards, research, and enforcement programs. 
Data suggest that sobriety checkpoints in combination with publicity can be effective in reducing crashes.  However, sobriety checkpoint programs have not achieved a significant general deterrence effect when examined in terms of program awareness, self-reported behavior change, and perception of increased likelihood of being stopped by the police and arrested.  There is a need to improve general deterrence so that enforcement programs can be more effective and the crash reduction effects sustained.  There is a need to improve the visibility of enforcement programs.

Description: 

The objective of this requirement is to assess the effectiveness of an earlier checkpoint start time and accompanying signage in raising public awareness of sobriety checkpoint activity and raising the publics perceived risk of an alcohol-impaired driver being stopped and arrested.  This requirement will include eight (8) tasks: (1) Final Refined Work Plan, (2) Recruit Sites, (3) Prepare for Baseline Telephone Survey, (4) Prepare for On-Site Intervention Activity, (5) Conduct Telephone Surveys, (6) Implement Sobriety Checkpoint Intervention Activity, (7) Brief NHTSA on Results and (8) Submit Final Report Deliverables.  All work required including preparation, submission, review, and acceptance of the final report shall be completed within thirty-two (32) months after the effective date of the contract.
The NAICS Code for this contract is 541720.  It is the Governments intent to award a Firm Fixed Price type contract for a performance period not to exceed thirty-six (36) months.  It is the Offerors responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted. The estimated date for release of the solicitation is on or about May 12, 2009. 



Period of Performance: Thirty-six (36) months starting on or about 9/8/2009.



RFP Number: DTNH22-09-R-00220



Contract Award:

NHTSA intends to issue a full and open, competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) with the intention of awarding a Firm Fixed Price type contract for a performance period not to exceed thirty-six (36) months.  All questions regarding this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail to sherese.gray@dot.gov no later than May 19, 2009. The anticipated award date for this resultant contract is expected on or about September 8, 2009.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Astrium GmbH, Dachauer Str. 665, Munchen, Germany, for maintenance and repair of one (1) neutron velocity selector, NVS-014.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, Maryland, currently has five (5) neutron velocity selectors (NVS).  The basic requirement is the maintenance and repair of one (1) neutron velocity selector NVS-014 (NIST property number 573386) to be performed by Astrium GmbH this year (Base Year).  The proposed acquisition will include 20 option items (5 option line items per year) for maintenance and repair of five (5) neutron velocity selectors (NVS-014, NVS-016, NVS-022, NVS-027, and NVS-047).  

About once a year, depending on the vibration/BCU signal and/or operation conditions of the NVS, an inspection/maintenance of the NVS must be performed by Astrium GmbH in order to keep the equipment operating to its original manufacturers specifications.  Therefore, NIST requires maintenance and/or repair to be performed on each NVS.  Astrium GmbH is the manufacturer that configured these NVSs to NIST specifications.  These NVSs operate under vacuum at very high speeds, 16,000 rpm (about 270 revolutions per second).  At these speeds, both the bearing and the balancing become very critical.  The work required is disassembly, replacement of bearings, reassembly and balancing and performance testing, which requires knowledge of proprietary drawings and procedures and experience that Astrium alone possesses.  This vendor combines the expertise required to achieve the mechanical stability of the rapidly rotating mass, provide the required tilt capability, and manufacture the specialized construction of the neutron absorbing blades.  Astrium is the only vendor in the world that builds and services these machines.  Astrium does not license other vendors to service their machines.  As a result, Astrium GmbH is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by April 17, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases (NIAMS), requires the services of three to five contractors for a program entitled: Ancillary and Complementary Research to the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI).  The nature of this program is to accelerate discoveries related to the onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis with particular emphasis on identification of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, better identification of markers of early disease and disease progression, development of more sensitive and specific indices for disease diagnosis and characterization, and identification of potential treatment targets.  Through the development and conduct of these studies, the NIAMS expects to foster collaborations between the broader research community and the OAI investigators.  Results from these investigations should improve our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis and will be helpful in determination of risk for disease and development of interventions.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has supported collection of blood samples, images, and clinical data from participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) since 2002, which has become part of a large public data base.  This well-characterized population provides a rare and valuable scientific resource maintained under contracts between NIAMS and the OAI centers. Promoting optimal use on a national scale of such a resource requires a multifaceted, concerted effort that would likely exceed the research capacities of individual study locations, and of OAI as a whole. The NIAMS and the researchers it supports have a responsibility to the public in general, and the scientific community in particular, to encourage the most rapid scientific progress possible using these resources. In order to take full advantage of such resources and to maximize their research value, it is important to stimulate the use of these samples and data collected with public funds by the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.  Data and images are currently available through a website (www.oai.ucsf.edu) and images through request at the same link.  The NIAMS seeks to support these investigations through the contract mechanism to ensure open access to the data and tools generated.  The proposals should include sections on how data would be made available to the OAI for inclusion in the OAI database and other open access NIH sources. 

The program objectives are as follows:

1.  Development of tools and resources to maximize public access to and use of the OAI database and image repository.

2.  Development of novel and efficient tools for analysis of MR images and x rays that can be applied to large numbers of images with high degrees of reproducibility for diagnosis and monitoring of OA-related changes.

3.  Identification and validation of risk factors for knee and hip OA including both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

4.  Determination of predictive role of MRI changes for subsequent radiographic and clinical outcome changes related to development of knee OA.
 
5.  Analyses of efficacy of biobehavioral, pharmacological, and 'natural' interventions (including pain meds, over the counter, CAM, aids, vitamins, etc) that subjects use in response to OA pain.  (Based on data already collected from the OAI)

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Gulf Marine, Panama City, FL 32405 for two (2) each 150 HP Honda engines to be installed on a boat.  NSWC PCD is tasked to operate and maintain all small boats used for project support.  From time to time engines have to be changed/replaced.  The Honda engines are one hundred fifty horse power four stroke Honda outboards, with gauges, switches, controls, water separators, batteries, stainless steel propellers and transom repair.  The requirement specified in the subject requisition represents the minimum requirements of the NSWC-PCD Ranges and Facilities Branch at this time.
Gulf Marine is the local Honda authorized "full line" dealer.  The only other dealer in the Panama City area is a "package" dealer and can only sell the engines with a boat.  The next nearest dealer is located in Blountstown, FL.  Therefore it is recommended that the motors be purchased from Gulf Marine as this saves the government both time and money for the initial installation (since the government will deliver and pick up the boat) as well as for any warrantee work that might need to be done, and parts availability.
The specified brand is required for the following reasons:  When outboard engines are bought, special tooling is needed to maintain these engines.  It would be cost prohibitive to maintain special tooling for many different brands of outboard engines therefore it will save the government money to purchase only one brand of outboards for our facility.   The Naval Support Activity (NSA) boathouse uses Honda outboards already which allows sharing of resources if the same brand is used.  Additionally, the EPA has come out with new water pollution standards for outboard engines therefore the new engines must meet these standards.  Honda Outboards meet or exceeds these standards.  
Award will be based on contractor quote on or about April 15, 2009.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   NAICS Code: 541380 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Office of Emergency Response (OEM) desires to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matricescontaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; instead, it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. OVERVIEW: The requirement is to ensure consistent analytical data of known and documented quality across the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN) (see SOW for full purpose).  A laboratory's admission to the ERLN will be based on completion of the documents submitted by the laboratory in the form of the Laboratory Membership Application and capability statement for EPA's ERLN. These documents will be evaluated by the EPA.  Please refer to the specific instructions provided in each section of the ERLN application. The ERLN application for vendors to complete can be found on EPA's webpage: http://epa.gov/oam/srpod/. under the following RFQ number, RFQ-DC-09-00160. Any and all services rendered by vendors will be ordered via the issuance of task orders and under the competitive requirements of FAR Part 6 and synopsis requirements of FAR Part 5, as applicable. Please note this is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The hand held scanner can be used to scan any part regardless of size in one pass and without the need to reduce the larger parts into cut up pieces.  In addition, the software that comes with the scanner converts the image in the scanner into a 3D virtual model in Pore and AutoCAD languages for further use in 3D assemblies and for conversion into 2D engineering drawings.  In addition to the scanner and its software, this award includes maintenance and onsite training.<BR><BR>Offers from concerns other than the above are not solicited.

<a href="mailto:andreas.deverikos2@us.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC Acquisition Center - DAAB07</a>
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations for an improved sustainment strategy that focuses on supply-chain management and performance based logistics (PBL) in support of the NVGs AN/PVS-7B/D, AN/PVS-14, and AN/AVS-6 spare parts.  A future solicitation/contract would provide PBL driven support and management services for CECOM managed NVG spare parts located worldwide.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from interested parties, to be answered during Industry Day, must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.<BR>BACKGROUND: The AN/PVS-7B/D is a single-tube night vision goggle that uses a Generation III image intensifier (MX-10130D), prisms and lenses to provide the user with simulated binocular vision.  It is used in starlight and moonlight by personnel for walking, driving, weapons firing, short-range surveillance, and such manual tasks as map reading, vehicle maintenance, and administering medical aid.  The AN/PVS-7B/D can be affixed to either a head mount that is held by head straps or to a helmet mount which attaches to the helmet.  The assembly incorporates an IR-emitting light source that provides illumination when required for close-up viewing.  Eyepiece diopter adjustment is provided so the device can be worn without corrective eyeglasses.<BR>The AN/PVS-14 is a single-tube monocular night vision device that uses a Generation III image intensifier (MX-11769).  It is a lightweight, self-contained, image intensification system capable of being either hand-held, mounted to a small arms weapons mounting rail, or mounted to a head mount or helmet mount.  The AN/PVS-14 is intended to be used in starlight and moonlight by personnel for walking, driving, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, and such manual tasks as map reading, vehicle maintenance, and administering medical aid.  It employs a variable gain that can be adjusted by the user.  The assembly incorporates an IR-emitting light source that provides illumination when required for close-up viewing.  Eyepiece diopter adjustment is provided so the device can be worn without corrective eyeglasses.<BR>The AN/AVS-6, Aviation Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) is a lightweight, high performance passive Generation III image intensifier (MX-10160A/C) system designed specifically for use by helicopter pilots during night flights.  The AN/AVS-6 consists of a helmet mount, a binocular imaging assembly, a low-profile battery pack, a carrying case, and ancillary equipment.  <BR>Currently, the supply-chain management of CECOM managed spare parts will be included in this RFI (NSNs and part numbers will be provided upon request).  Technical Manuals will also be available for each of the NVG systems.  All spare parts are consumable items and the current maintenance structure is field level repair only.  This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to improve the requisition wait time of NVG spare parts; increase sustainment readiness; and decrease sustainment costs without changing the current maintenance structure.  Management of suppliers and spare parts within the NVGs supply chain (including requirements determination, forecasting, stock, store, issue and transportation) will be addressed.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <BR>OBJECTIVE: This office looking to improve upon the current sustainment strategy for CECOM managed spare parts.  This office is searching for the best strategy to support the NVGs without interrupting the logistic support currently provided to Warfighter.  The strategy must also be seamless to the Warfighter and completely interface with the Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS).  The best sustainment strategy will produce an outcome that reduces the requisition wait times and costs while improving current systems readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas.  Partnerships are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for supply-chain management is identified.  If the proposed sustainment strategy utilizes or partners with organic entities such as Army Depots or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as a source of supply, then an explanation is required on how these organizations will be used.  All items included in this RFI are CECOM managed items.  However, the family of the NV goggles uses DLA managed items.  The proposed sustainment strategy may consider, but it is not required, the use of FAR 51.000 for the use of DLA as a source of supply.    <BR><BR>A supply-chain management service PBL contract may be utilized to enhance support of NVGs spare parts based on a Business Case Analysis (BCA) recommended PBL alternative.  The Government contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15, that may result in a Firm Fixed Price type contract lasting five years with additional five one- year options.  This office will seek a single supply-chain manager due to the complexity of the required technical support to the customer.  Partnerships are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for supply-chain management is identified.    <BR>RESPONSES: Response will be a 3 step process.  The first step is to inform the Government in writing (see SUBMISSION INFORMATION below), within 20 calendar days after the RFI release date, of interest in this PBL effort and submission of written questions to be answered at Industry day.  The second step will be participation in a question and answer session at the Industry Day, whose date and place will be released to interested vendors.  The final step is the submission of a written response to this RFI no later than 30 calendar days after Industry day.  Submission shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages.   Submission shall be capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margin (top, bottom, left and right) and a 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font. Line spacing shall be set at no less than single space.  Tables, drawings and header/footer information shall be 10 point Arial font or larger.  For tables and drawings, landscape orientation is permitted.  Microsoft Office Professional 2000 and PowerPoint 2000 or later shall be used to create the files.  All graphics shall be compatible with MS PowerPoint 2000.  If any of the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Responses should include, but are not limited to the following:<BR>(A)	Company History: A one page history to include previous major products and primary customer base.  Additionally, RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Governments consideration of the company as a prospective contractor for maintenance, supply support, engineering, training, field support, and other services including handling of the classified information up to SECRET.<BR>(B)	Metrics: Suggest methods to create and maintain a metrics database for monitoring the performance of the contract.  Also, discuss how metrics can be used to promote an incentive based contract award. <BR>(C)	Additional Information: Knowledge of the identified NVG systems that would demonstrate a technical/logistics capability to support the supply chain management of their spare parts.  <BR>(D)	Surge Requirements: PBL support strategies under peacetime, contingencies, and war scenarios to include ramp-up and draw-down in response to surge requirements and the cessation of contingencies or war scenarios.<BR>(E)	Cost: Vendor should provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of its recommended PBL alternative. <BR><BR>SUBMISSION INFORMATION: RFI shall be submitted no later than 30 calendar days after Industry day to US Army CECOM LCMC, IEW&S Directorate, Attention: AMSEL-LC-IEW-N-II (Susan F. Weir), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703.  Also submit via electronic mail to susan.weir@us.army.mil with a copy to Robert.esposito@us.army.mil.  <BR>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by an industry response to this RFI.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Propriety will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.<BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to perform Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) removal and remediation for the 33-acres Open Burn/Open Detonation (OB/OD) Burning Grounds at site Operable Unit (OU) 5 located at the Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant (CHAAP) in Grand Island, NE.  The site contains dispersed and bulk gravel mines, as well as bulk TNT.  In 2006 - 2007, a limited amount of clearance was completed at the site as a safety action before the site was transitioned to an MMRP site, which now requires additional work to achieve the clearances required for transfer of the property.<BR>There are three soil zones on this project.  The Exclusion Zone (EZ)  which encompasses the initial 26 grids (each grid is 100 x 100) - may require remote excavation and remote sifting.  The Restricted Zone (RZ)  additional grids - may require armored excavation and armored sifting.  The Western Unrestricted Zone (WUZ) - additional grids  may only require excavation with no sifting.  The Contractor can assume that most of the excavated soils will be transported and placed at the CHAAP Pistol Range, with the rest of the soils requiring testing (for explosive, VOCs and metals) transport, and disposal at a Subtitle D Landfill.  The Contractor will prepare draft and final Closure Reports detailing the investigative results, summarizing results of the previous site evaluation work and studies, and provide a final assessment of the site, including conclusions and recommendations.  If proposed excavation and sifting operations are required to be remote and/or will have to be armored to protect personnel IAW DDESB TP 16 and DOD 6055.9STD.<BR>The draft EE/CA (Engineering Estimate/Cost Analysis) which will provide background and history on the site will be made available on ftp://ftp.usace.army.mil/ NLT 13 April 2009.<BR>Plan to issue the Request for Proposal 0/A 24 April 2009 with a closing date O/A 25 May 2009.

patterns. Phylogeny is the only major commercial provider of customized <sup>35</sup>S

<DESC>The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee Price (CPIF) type of contract for up to four (4) contracts.  The period of performance will be 60 months for this effort with a range of $50,000,000 to a maximum of $60,000,000. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine if there are any businesses available who are capable of performing the following effort:  (1) UAI Program Office Support -- Provide support to individual platform/store program offices in their efforts toward integration of UAI requirements into their specific Operational Flight Program (OFP) and Mission Planning components.  This support will be situational and will depend on need and a request from the Program Office for such support.  Support may be provided at all phases of an OFP program, domest! ic and/or international, including requirements definition and generation, system development and demonstration, and system testing and fielding.  (2) Working group, integrated product team, documentation and governance support -- Provide Platform/Store (PS) and Mission Planning (MP) Interface Control Documents (ICDs) and Launch Acceptable Region Data Package (LARDP) Super Joint Interface Control Working Group (SJICWG) support, to consist of secretariat functions utilizing and managing a secure web site provided by the Government, providing key technical support in generating proposed changes or additions to the PSICD, MPICD, and LAR documents and associated Compliance Certification Plans (CCPs), as well as providing partial support from Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) programs not currently funded for UAI implementation to participate in SJICWG activities.  All SJICWG support will follow the specified processes outlined in the UAI Interface Control Plan (ICP).  (3) R! isk Reduction Studies -- Perform Risk Reduction studies as requested for incorporation of follow on interface requirements into current UAI development efforts.  Follow on interface requirements are considered to be those functional and logical interfaces that are outside the scope of current UAI development efforts.  This effort will include technical reports and presentations documenting potential identified candidates, feasibility, trade studies, as well as roadmaps and plans for incorporating interfaces from these systems or technologies into the UAI program.  For those interfaces or technologies deemed feasible for near-term inclusion into UAI, draft Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and associated draft Interface Change Notices (ICNs) will be generated with respect to the appropriate PSICD, MPICD, and LAR core documents.  The draft ECPs/ICNs will either be incorporated into UAI core documents through formal SJICWG processes, or will otherwise be refined during follow on, full development efforts to address and incorporate these interfa! ces into UAI.  (4) UAI Development Tools - Universal implementation of the UAI requirements across a multitude of platforms and store programs has been facilitated by use of common development tools developed and provided by the UAI Program Office.  Successful contractors will be required to provide continued support of these development tools, including but not limited to:  (a) UAI Certification Tool (CT):  Update all Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs, currently including the Mission Planning CT, Universal Store Simulator (USS), and Universal Platform Simulator (UPS)) to be current with ICD revisions and (b) Updates to the LAR Toolset.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) SUBMISSION.  This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small disadvantaged business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a wom! an-owned business, a service disabled veteran-owned small business, a HUB zone small business concern, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICs) code 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences with the Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Aircraft Engine Parts exception applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 1,000 employees.

<DESC>In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (E&IT) accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C. 794d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others.

The Government is interested in obtaining information regarding sources to provide Section 508 Consulting, Testing, Implementation and Training. Much of Section 508 compliance is concerned with making websites, intranets, and web-enabled applications accessible. GSA wants to ensure that its staff offices and organizations web sites, applications, documents, forms, records, and other E&IT are Section 508 compliant. We will also hold an industry conference to discuss the Governments anticipated requirement. This is intended to be an open forum of discussion.

Brief summary of company experience SPECIFIC in nature to the type of work called for in the description below.  In particular, specific experience in working directly with Southern Nevada Native American Tribal Governments in the Spring Mountains region of Souther Nevada, and particularily any Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi Tribal Governments.  If you do NOT possess this very specific experience, please state this fact CLEARLY.  You may then go on to describe the experience you do possess, and explain how your experience qualifies you in your estimation to do this type of work.  Perhaps experience with other Tribal Governments in the Southwest, etc.

DESCRIPTION OF POSSIBLE PROCUREMENT:

The USDA Forest Service and the DOI Fish and Wildlife Service are working in partnership to produce a project that will improve the agencies relationship with the Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi Tribes that have cultural and historic ties to the Spring and Sheep Mountain Ranges. 

There are two primary deliverables which would be expected from this contract. The first would be the development of an agreement between each federal agency and the Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi Tribes. Two distinct agreements would need to be developed and signed so that the Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service could maintain distinct authorities over the lands that they each manage. These agreements would outline the processes by which the Forest Service/Fish and Wildlife Service would work with the tribal governments, particularly in regard to federal capital improvement projects, programs, and policies. It would also clarify the roles and responsibilities of each government during government to government consultation on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and the Desert National Wildlife Refuge.

The second deliverable would be a pair of resource management projects  One on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and another on the Desert National Wildlife Refuge. These resource management projects would provide an opportunity to evaluate components of the federal/tribal consultation agreement and would provide partnership opportunities between the agencies and the tribes. Any proposed resource management project would need to meet objectives of both the agencies and the tribes. The project would also incorporate active participation of the tribes. In addition to coordinating the resource management project, the contractor would also produce a monitoring plan to help ensure the protection of the resource being managed.

A series of meetings would be included among the list of deliverables. These meetings would include both federal and tribal representatives in order to help facilitate development of the agreements and developing the resource management projects. Additional meetings between the individual Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi Tribes may also be necessary to develop acceptance among the various tribes.

The intent of this project would be to clarify the consultation process in an innovative and cost effective way that is acceptable to both federal and tribal governments.

Sought Contractor Qualification goals

The ideal contractor would have demonstrated experience working with the Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi Tribes, who have cultural and historic ties to the Spring Mountains. This contractor would also have experience developing approaches that strengthen the interface between federal and tribal/indigenous governments. A successful contractor will have a strong working knowledge of Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi culture as well as awareness of the social and economic issues affecting the tribes. They will also be cognizant of the operating environment of federal agencies. Demonstrated experience with indigenous resource management strategies is also ideal. Essential to these qualifications is the ability to develop innovative projects with active tribal involvement that assist the federal agencies in fulfilling their management responsibilities in a culturally responsive manner.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information in regard topotential sources for a follow-on procurement to the Consolidated Information TechnologyServices (CONITS) Task Order (Number L-70750D) under the General ServicesAdministrations (GSA) Millennia Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC),GS-00T-99-ALD-0209, GSA Task Order Number T03-01-DS-L003.  The Langley Research Center(LaRC) Information Technology Enhanced Services (LITES) contract will be the follow-oneffort to the current CONITS task order.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do notrequest a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsizedin FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Services.  It is the potentialofferors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation orsynopsis. One of the primary goals of this synopsis is to assist NASA Langley in determiningwhether a Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.  If afull and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be usedto aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.  As no decision on aset-aside has yet been made, all qualified firms are encouraged to respond.  The NorthAmerican Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541513 andthe size standard under this code is average annual receipts of $25 Million.The LITES contract will provide computing support services for complex informationtechnology (IT) systems that are uniquely configured or highly specialized in functionand include state-of-the-art IT.  Systems supported include unique and high-end systemsused by Mission and Mission-support staff at LaRC. LITES will provide a wide range ofsupport functions including those for non-standard operating systems, for systeminterfaces, or for use within a dynamic environment such as a research laboratory or testfacility. LITES will provide integrated support that encompasses all activities(including system administration and hardware and software maintenance) necessary todevelop, deploy, upgrade, operate, and maintain a  system that delivers an IT capabilityfor research and development (R&D) use and business applications.LITES will also provide IT services incorporating new and emerging technologies that willevolve over the life of the contract.  The scope of support to be provided under LITES isintended to cover all requirements for "Information Technology" including computers,ancillary equipment, software, firmware, services, and related resources. Softwaredevelopment, operations, and maintenance under LITES apply to software at several levelsof risk and control from minimal to critical (as it relates to impact to the Government).No later than nine (9) months after the contract effective date, the successful offerorsquality system will be required to be Certified/Registered to the current ANSI/ISO/ASQCISO 9001 standard, Quality Management Systems Requirements.  In addition, no later thannine (9) months after the contract effective date, the successful offer (includingteaming partners/subcontractors) that will be performing software engineering will berequired to be CMMI for Development Capability Level 2 or higher as measured by aSoftware Engineering Institute (SEI) authorized lead appraiser from an externalorganization in the following Process Areas:(1)	Requirements Management(2)	Configuration Management(3)	Process and Product Quality Assurance(4)	Measurement and Analysis(5)	Project Planning(6)	Project Monitoring and Control(7)	Supplier Agreement ManagementThe IT systems supported under LITES are used in R&D computing and advanced engineeringsupport and business applications. The environment for the R&D activities is by naturevery fluid and evolutionary; often an unexpected result will focus the researchersattention in an entirely new direction. In order to maximize the ability to change coursequickly, the IT systems used by the researcher are subject to change and realignment. Tosupport these systems, LITES will require flexible staffing with high-level skills thatare continually reviewed with an eye toward emerging, cutting-edge technologies.Software development and maintenance under LITES will provide applications needed tosupport R&D and advanced engineering activities that are usually not well defined at theoutset. The applications tend to be evolutionary, gaining more focus on the goal as thecode is fine-tuned to the researchers requirements. It will be critical that theapplication administrator is well educated in the mission requirements as related to thespecific application. The process will rely on a high level of understanding of how theapplication functions within the system architecture and the potential impacts to ITsecurity once the application is brought online. The skills inherent in this type ofsupport are highly specialized and success will rely on a diverse mixture of severalskill sets. To illustrate the LITES environment, here are some specific examples of anticipatedrequirements:IT Security: This task provides LaRC with an incident response and computer forensicscapability; intrusion detection and monitoring capability; remote access compliance;support of IT system security plans; coordination of IT security activities with otherCenters; perimeter protection (including a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and firewall);and outreach. Key aspects of the task are the unknown day-to-day intrusions and threatsand the countermeasures needed to safeguard the Centers network. The task requires avariety of continuously evolving skills to address the dynamic nature of systemvulnerabilities. Specific projects arise on an ad hoc basis and must be addressed quicklyand skillfully.Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab Computer Administration: The lab computer systemconsists of a heterogeneous network of Linux and Unix servers, Linux and Unixworkstations, and high-end computer clusters that require system administration, systemtuning, and maintenance of network security and resource availability for NASA personnel,contractors, and grantees within and outside the LaRC network domain. Nodes supportedunder this task continue to grow dramatically; currently we have reached a total of 27physically distinct clusters and 52 sub-clusters consisting of 8,017 processing coressupported by LITES. As with any cutting edge technology, bugs will continue to bediscovered and corrected through extensive communication with the hardware vendorengineering and technical support staff. Advanced Engineering Environment Lab Operations: These tasks will provide support in theareas of data visualization, geometry modeling, and knowledge management. The GeometryLaboratory (GEOLAB) serves as a Center resource to the LaRC research community in dealingwith geometry and grid generation issues. The GEOLAB is an open shop facility with anon-site technical staff available to collaborate with researchers or to take on geometryrelated tasks. The geometry modeling and grid generation support provided includes theproduction of accurate geometry definitions and numerical grids for Computational FluidDynamics (CFD), Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM), and other engineering analyses.The GEOLAB typically supports 30 to 60 production and consultation tasks a year, with asmany as 100 geometry models, geometry comparisons, and structured and unstructured gridsdelivered as products. The majority of these tasks are production tasks of short durationand are accomplished within 2 to 6 weeks. The GEOLAB also develops software to facilitategeometry modeling and grid generation. The Data Visualization and Analysis Lab (DVAL) isa central, open shop resource available to meet the data analysis and scientificvisualization needs of the LaRC research community. The capabilities within the DVALinclude development of immersive, collaborative virtual environments; flow featureextraction techniques; visualization systems for generating computer visualizations, bothstills and animations; methods for visual comparisons of experimental and computationaldatasets; and image/data reduction tools and techniques. In addition, the DVAL expertiseincludes software development capabilities to produce custom software tools tailored tothe unique requirements of the customer. Application areas cover a wide variety ofdisciplines including computational fluid dynamics, computational structures, atmosphericmodeling, remote sensing, materials science, and experimental fluid dynamics. For theGEOLAB and DVAL, all work is specific to the individual research customer on an as-neededbasis, resulting in a great variation in workload and staffing over the course of theyear.Airspace and Traffic Operations Simulation (ATOS) Development and Enhancements: Theobjective of this task will be to develop and enhance NASA-Langley Research CentersAirspace and Traffic Operations Simulation, including methodologies to enable researchexperiments in support of future air transportation system concepts and technologies suchas those currently being explored by NASAs Airspace Systems Program projects (NextGenAirspace and NextGen Airportal).  Tasks will explore new methodologies for thedevelopment and enhancement of distributed airborne simulation tools, design and developnew engineering models of revolutionary and enabling airborne technologies, integratethese new simulation tools and engineering models into the ATOS, and aid in the conductof simulations (including experiment design, data analysis, and reporting). Theoverarching goal will be to produce and maintain an integrated, operational, andproductive Air Traffic Management (ATM) research tool that also incorporates capabilitiesfor transitioning to simulations of airport surface operations.Research goals will be met through studies and experiments conducted using the ATOS(hosted in the Air Traffic Operations Lab, or ATOL, at LaRC) as well as with othersimulation tools that may be linked to the ATOS for specific experiments.  These researchgoals include  (1) evaluating the impact of uncertainties, real-world system behaviors,weather, and human factors on the safety and performance of airborne trajectorymanagement applications; (2) developing new 4D dynamic Required Navigation Performance(RNP) capabilities and determining how they may affect the performance of variousairborne applications integrated with ground-based operations; (3) creating new metricsfor dynamic airspace complexity and evaluating the effects of various distributedcomplexity-mitigation functions and en-route coordination strategies; and (4) evaluatingdifferent algorithms and procedures for super-density terminal area merging and spacingapplications. In the area of airport surface operations, research goals include (1)evaluating Collision Avoidance for Airport Traffic (CAAT) algorithms in the low altitude,runway, and taxiway operating environment; (2) evaluating integrated aircraft-based CAATand ground-based taxi conformance monitoring and longer term collision detection andresolutions solutions; and (3) developing and evaluating algorithms and procedures tomaximize airport arrival and departure capacity, including reduced in-trail separationrequirements, closely-spaced and converging/intersecting runway operations, and runwaybalancing.Development, implementation, and integration of new simulation capabilities will berequired to perform vital studies and experiments in support of planned research goals.These simulation capabilities generally fall into the following categories: (1)development of engineering models of advanced technologies that enable new concepts ofoperation, such as airborne four-dimensional (4D) trajectory & separation management,terminal area merging and spacing, and in-trail procedures (oceanic and domestic) forenroute climbs and descents; (2) new 4D trajectory generation capability for the on-boardflight management computer (FMC), including a common lexicon for the exchange of 4Dtrajectory data between various airborne and ground-based systems and applications; (3)advancements in the simulation of the basic aircraft, including airframe and engineperformance models and control laws; (4) improvements to fundamental simulation controlfunctions, including timing, mode transitions, and scenarios, that support the full rangeof experiment types from real-time human-in-the-loop studies to large-scale batch runs;and (5) evaluation of algorithms and procedures for airport arrival and departureoperations.High Performance Computing and Distributed Systems: LITES supports several highperformance computing programs and projects. The systems that these activities requireare current, state-of-the-art computing systems that utilize a variety of computerhardware, operating systems, and applications codes. The major requirements for thesupport of high performance computing specific to this work area include providing expertconsulting services on the application of high performance hardware and softwaresolutions for Langleys programs and projects; administering organizational level andCenter computer level systems used primarily for the production of engineering data wherelarge numbers of processors, large memories, or extensive data management is required tomeet Langley engineering and scientific goals; facilitating the development, debugging,performance analysis, and optimization of user and system-wide applications; developingperformance metrics, benchmarking, testing, and evaluating new architectures and softwareto meet current and future needs; administering Langley parallel and clusteredcomputational or  application servers with state-of-the-art architectures; supportingspecialized libraries for system or software development for high performance computingarchitecture; supporting specialized applications codes for use on high performancecomputing architecture; and developing unique solutions to isolate, eliminate, ormitigate information technology-centric problems in engineering and scientificapplications. In addition there are distributed systems consisting of clusters ofnetworked computers and associated equipment, located at various sites throughout theCenter, which are used in specific experimental or analytical environments.   Theseclusters are used by small groups of researchers or engineers with particular specialtiessuch as computational fluid dynamics, computational structures, engineering design anddevelopment, modeling and simulation, software development, and other IT intensiveapplications. Geographic Information System: Geographic Information System (GIS) is an intuitivespatial data management and decision support tool. Institutional managers are the currentprimary users of data and processes, but use of the technology by researchers is on therise. The spatial information management system is built around a relational databaseconsisting of data that includes or is derived from such records as: aerial photographs,topographic maps, descriptions and engineering drawings of buildings and facilities,utility plats, geological data, climatic records, financial data, and personnel locatorrecords.  The location of objects to the level of individual offices is given with highaccuracy in coordinates derived from the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS).GIS at Langley integrates functions from institutional databases with the goal ofincreasing the accuracy and sustainability of data. The database can be interactivelyqueried through web pages to extract up-to-date maps or plans restricted to selectedfeatures or to produce reports relating selected data.	Automated space allocationoptimization is an area where spatial data technologies are being applied to increaseoverall efficiency and effectiveness. Requirements to support GIS include providingintegrated support of the GIS systems; updating and enhancing GIS databases; providingfield observation, network solutions, equipment readiness, and report generation insupport of GPS data gathering and use; developing and enhancing software products for thedisplay, maintenance, and publication of building spatial data; and developing newsoftware tools and maintaining existing tools to support the activities of the GIS using.NET and ArcGIS Server technologies.Large Scale Data Storage and Retrieval System:	The Contractor shall support the CentralStorage System (CSS).

<RESPDATE>041709
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a high-performance optical wavelength meter (wavemeter) with the specifications listed below.  This device will be used as a frequency reference for a numbers of lasers in the laboratory.  Initially it is intended to be used with lasers at 650 nm and 350 nm, however as wide of a wavelength range as possible is desirable to accommodate an expansion of the devices use to wavelengths which span the near-ultraviolet to near infrared.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an electron microscope that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
NIST has a need for a wavemeter that would meet the following requirements:
1)	The minimum measurable wavelength must be at least as low as 350 nm, but an extension as deep into the UV as possible is desirable
2)	The maximum measurable wavelength must be at least 900 nm, but an extension as deep into the near-infrared as possible is desirable
3)	The desired absolute accuracy is 10 MHz at 671 nm or better.  Tradeoffs between an extended wavelength range and ran improved absolute accuracy will be considered however.  
4)	For units requiring periodic calibration to an external frequency reference, a stabilized HeNe laser (&#8776;630 nm) may be assumed as the reference laser.
5)	Measurement resolution less than or equal to 1 MHz
6)	A built-in LCD output on the device is desired, but units requiring a connection to a computer via USB for display of output will also be considered
7)	External control of wavemeter via USB

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  
Companies that manufacture wavemeters are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing construction services for the following project for Renovation Building 448 Naval Base New London, Groton, CT 
Description of proposed project:  
Renovation Building 448 Naval Base New London, Groton, CT The contract will abate an environmental hazard in Building 448 caused by the asbestos containing spray-on fireproofing. The project also repairs or replaces components of the HVAC system, installs a fire sprinkler system, replaces suspended ceilings and light fixtures removed during the asbestos abatement, installation of fire sprinklers, building roof replacement and interior painting. This project involves the abatement of asbestos containing spray-on fireproofing materials that have been applied to structural steel. Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) components including air handling units, coils, piping, ducts, controls, and circulating pumps will be replaced or repaired. A fire sprinkler system will be installed in the section of the building that was constructed in 1971. The entire building roof will be replaced. Suspended ceilings and light fixtures required to be removed for asbestos abatement shall be replaced and interior painting performed. The project may also include: interior space renovations, interior demolition, electrical system upgrades, installation of fire alarm systems, and installation of furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E).Building 448 is a four story building constructed in 1971. A three story addition was added in 1979 increasing the building space to 61,745 sf. The structural steel in the original four story section of the building was coated with a sprayed on fire proofing material which contained asbestos. When the addition to building 448 was built in 1979 it included a fire sprinkler system.Although predominately intact and undamaged, the asbestos fire proofing material does release enough material to accumulate fibrous asbestos dust on the suspended ceiling system. Access to spaces above the suspended ceiling is restricted due to the potential to encounter asbestos containing materials. Approximately 73% of the HVAC system is comprised of original components from 1971 and1979. These HVAC components are either at the end of their service life. A 2002 HVAC study recommended the replacement of: three major air handling units, chilled water pumps, piping, controls, air cooled chiller, ductwork, high velocity reheat boxes, and electrical wiring.  The built up roofing is missing aggregate in sections which exposes the roofing surface.  Sections of the roof and flashing have blisters, holes and tears which allow water penetration. Water from roof leaks has damaged ceiling tiles. Roofing materials appear to be original from initial construction. The roofing materials ! may contain asbestos. An asbestos survey of the building is underway.The total project price magnitude is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.
All Service Disabled Veteran (SDV) small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses, and other certified small businesses are encouraged to respond.  Large Business submittals will not be considered.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is a mechanism for obtaining feedback from industry in regard to the general requirement stated below. This is not a synopsis for a Request for Proposal (RFP). The notice is a market research tool to determine potential sources prior to the issuance of a RFP. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), is the primary Research and Development (R&D) arm of DHS. S&T is tasked with researching and accessing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help federal, state, and local governments protect the homeland. S&T has the responsibility to prepare future generations of scientists and engineers to protect the Nation by giving qualified researchers the opportunity to work along side S&T professionals to develop the tools to protect Americans. DHS S&T takes a multi-disciplinary approach to addressing issues of homeland security and seeks candidates with expertise in the physical, biological, engineering or social sciences.

DHS S&T is planning to award a contract to a contractor capable of supporting S&T host offices by providing highly trained scientists and engineers (fellows) who will contribute their scientific, technological, and engineering knowledge and expertise and external perspectives to the broad range of issues that DHS addresses. The proposed contract is for a one year base period and four one year options. The anticipated contract award date is January 1, 2010. 

The prospective candidates selected by the contractor must demonstrate exceptional competence in areas of science or engineering; have excellent written and oral communication skills; have the ability to work in an interdisciplinary setting with policy-makers and other non-scientific partners; be cognizant of and demonstrate sensitivity toward political and social issues; and, perhaps most importantly, have a strong interest and experience in applying their knowledge toward the solution of homeland security threats and issues. Areas of focus and support include: explosives detection, social and behavioral sciences, risk, economics, and decision science, human factors, chemical threats and countermeasures, biological threats and countermeasures, food and agriculture security, transportation security, border security, immigration studies, maritime and port security, infrastructure protection, natural disasters and related geophysical studies, emergency preparedness and response, communications and interoperability, and advanced data analysis and visualization.
 
The contractor will invite applications from individuals in any physical, biological, or social science, any field of engineering, or any relevant interdisciplinary field. Applicants must have a PhD, MD, DVM, Dr.PH, or an equivalent doctoral-level degree by the application deadline.  Individuals with a masters' degree in engineering and three years of post-degree professional experience may apply. Federal employees are not eligible for the fellowships. Applicants must be US citizens. The fellowships will be for one-year appointments, potentially renewable for up to four additional years. Stipends will be provided by the contractor to the fellows in amounts consistent with a candidate's education, experience and salary history, with allowances for health insurance, relocation and professional travel. Placement at DHS will be arranged with the assistance of the contractor, and will reflect the Fellow's interests and expertise. 

The contractor will be responsible for identifying, reviewing, screening, and recruiting candidates through a competitive selection process from a broad array of backgrounds and a diversity of geographic, disciplinary, gender, and ethnic perspectives, coming from a range of sectors including academia, industry, and NGOs. The contractor will conduct placement interviews with selected candidates and agency host offices to insure compatibility between projects, expertise, and interests, match finalists with DHS offices, and issue offer letters to confirm final assignments. The contractors managers and other staff shall collaborate and interact regularly with cognizant DHS personnel throughout the entire placement process. 

Responses to this sources sought synopsis, including capability statements, should be no more than five (5) pages). Any material submitted should be at the unclassified level. Capability statements should be sent via e-mail to sharon.flowers1@dhs.gov  by 5:00 pm Eastern Time on April 21, 2009 with the title of the project in the subject line.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

1. INTRODUCTION

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Records, Publications and Mail Management and the DHS Office of Procurement Operation (OPO) are issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to gain knowledge of qualified and interested business concerns with experience in providing IT integration and change management and training services for the implementation of an electronic records management system in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration standards and guidelines.  


2. BACKGROUND

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was formed after the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 to protect the nation against future threats to the homeland.  Within the newly formed department are 25 components with varying Records Management programs.  In order to document the business of DHS, protect the rights and interests of the public and the government, and ensure resumption of business in the event of a disaster, not only is a strong Records Management program required, but also a method of managing electronic records and email.

Agencies are mandated to implement records management systems through the Government Paperwork Elimination Act wherever practicable.  Many other statutes require some form of protection for electronic records, ensuring reliability and authenticity.  This is particularly important since most business transactions are now conducted electronically.


3. REQUIREMENT

Purpose
The DHS Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Office of Records, Publications, and Mail Management, Records Management Program is leading the Departments Electronic Records, Document, and E-mail Management System (ERDEMS) efforts.  DHS is transitioning toward a department-wide ERDEMS application.  DHS Headquarters along with all 25 Components Headquarters and their field operations will be utilizing the enterprise wide ERMS application for records management.  During the first year, DHS will implement on a small scale (3-5% of users) the ERDEMS application in order to test the IT integration, Organizational Change Management, and process adjustments within the Departments Records Management Program.  Upon collecting, analyzing, and understanding the impact with all data associated with the small scale implementation, the Department will make the necessary adjustments and begin the large scale transition and implementation to ERDEMS Department-wide.

While improved efficiencies are driving the transition toward ERDEMS, many legal requirements equally drive this necessity.  Through the ERDEMS transition, DHS will be able to achieve efficiencies in the business process enabling greater front line mission focus as well as meet legal requirements.  An example of meeting the requirements of the many federal statues, DHS must, in order to meet the requirements of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), develop a means of maintaining records in electronic format, particularly those involved in transacting business with the public requiring electronic signatures.  To that end, DHS needs to establish an enterprise-wide records management application (RMA) with the forward-thinking plan of implementing it DHS-wide in a phased approach.  The ultimate goal is to identify and implement procedural and technological solutions business area by business area and system by system throughout DHS.

Organizational Change Management and Training 
The contractor will be responsible for executing an effective change management plan for the transition toward ERMS.  Change management will need to be planned and managed in a systematic fashion for each of its components as well as DHS HQ.  This will require understanding organizational framework, the organizations function, processes and workflows and then developing a change management approach that best meets the needs of that organization.  The contractor will be required to manage and control the process of change and should treat it separately from the issue of ERDEMS, until such time when the blending of the change process and IT integration of ERDEMS should occur.  A contractor will need to change management through two dimensions; content and a process dimension.  Contractors may rely on some similarities in past change management activities.  However, it will be important for the contractor to understand that the organizational languages, values, and culture may differ and at the root and detailed level the problems differ.  Principally though the overall process of change and change management will remain uniform and it is this fundamental understanding of the change process across various organizations and structures that the contractor will need to utilize to effectively implement change toward records management and transition toward ERDEMS.  

The contractor will need to complete the change process as unfreezing, changing, and refreezing in order for change management to be considered a success.  The process will need to address the change issues of how, how do we get an organization to change from X to Y?  In addition, the contractor will need to address the change issues of what, what is this change trying to accomplish? What indicators will signal success? What standards will apply?  What measures of performance are we trying to affect?  The third change process issue will be to manage the why, why are we implementing this change? Why does the previous why of doing business not work?  Why is productivity affected through this change?  While the contractor will need to address the change process through the unfreezing, changing, and refreezing process, the contractor will also need to address the how, what, and why aspects of change management in its approach and planned execution.

While providing variance in change management training to an organization is important towards its acceptance of change management, the contractor will need to categorize and framework its approaches into the least amount of training variances to meet this objective efficiently and effectively.  Some training will need to be conducted by classroom training, while others may be hands on approach, and other still may be web based  learning.  The contractor will be responsible for executing the best approach to ensure effective and efficient change management training.  An important element of this change management training is to ensure the comprehensive of the value add of records management to the business and its process.  

The next level of change management will be to train an organization on how to use electronic records management, specifically the selected COTS product identified for the department-wide implementation.  The initial change management initiative will not be hinged upon the IT solution.  However, the understanding and use of the IT solution will be a critical step in the overall success of change management.  The contractor will need to manage both aspects of this program separately, until such time it makes sense to blend the two requirements.  In all cases the contractor will need to lead the change management activity in front of the IT solution rollout.  The success of the IT solution rollout will be based on the success of an effective change management approach and execution.

A final deliberation point is that the Contractor will need to consider in its change management approach with Components throughout the Department.  Many components have Records programs at various stages ranging from no program to a well established program.  Establishing a solid records program with sound internal controls and measures is vital prior to transitioning into an ERDEMS system.  Many components have additional complexities when dealing with records at the field operations level.  Field operations generate and manage records along with Component HQ.  Ensuring effective records management requires considering impact and effectiveness to field operations as well as component HQ.  Transition into ERDEMS will occur at the HQ as well as the field operations.  

IT Implementation and Services
The contractor will be required to identify the best platform and network approach for hardware, hosting, servicing, and managing the ERDEMS system.  The contractor will need to work with the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) as well as Component CIOs throughout the IT implementation and services phase of this program.  OCAO will approve the final selection of hardware, servers, platforms, and network requirements in collaboration with the OCIO.  The contractor will need to develop a phased implementation approach, manage the IT change management aspect for the IT implementation, which is separate from the organizational change management.  

The contractor will need to assess the various IT information management systems that collect, house, and manage data as well as records.  The contractor will need to develop a solution to connect all IT information systems to the ERDEMS system through a phased approach.  The contractor will need to assess the IT information systems and categorize them based on mission and information risk.  A common thread to connect these systems will need to be identified by the contractor and ultimately connected to a single ERMS system.  This will also include developing a back up system either through a mirrored system, various redundancies and ability to utilize the ERDEMS during a COOP situation.  

The contractor will need to develop a system that is capable of handling simultaneously connecting up-to 30% of all Department users on a server, either through load balancing, caching system, or a distributed network.  Bandwidth needs will need to be identified as the ERDEMS system will also contain compressed and uncompressed digital video, audio recordings, and compressed and uncompressed photos as well as many other types of non-document types of digital records.  The contractor will need to ensure the system is capable of handling both 30% of all Department users simultaneously as well as upload and download bandwidth for the users across various digital media ranging from 50 MB to 1 GB in size.

IT Integration
While the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is not the program lead, the OCIO play a vital role in the successful IT integration of the ERMS system.  Along with the DHS OCIO, Component CIOs will also be a major stakeholder for a successful integration.   Each component has multiple information management systems that create, manage, and retain records for mission effectiveness and efficiencies.  The ERDEMS system will need to manage and connect to these varying systems if they are compliant with the DoD 5015.2 Chapter 2 and 4 requirements, or if not compliant, the non-compliant system(s) will be phase-out and its records will be rolled up into the DHS ERDEMS system.  The contractor will need to plan and execute the phase-out for non-compliant systems.  DHS will review available COTS products that best meets the needs of the Department as well as seek advice on COTS products and best practice on IT integration as it relates to ERDEMS.  While DHS will select the COTS product, it will consult the contractor during the selection process.  However, the contractor will need to purchase the selected COTS product, plan and execute the implementation of the selected COTS product.  

The contractor will also need to work with various organizations within DHS and its Components.  The ERDEMS system will also act as the background database server for intranet portals within DHS.  For example, the DHS Directive System will utilize the ERDEMS system for retaining and keeping the most current DHS Directives.  Users though will interface with the DHS intranet for access to the most current DHS Directive.  When a user clicks on the link for a Directive, the Intranet should pull the Directive from the ERDEMS system and display the record copy as a read and print only option.  The user will never see the ERDEMS system and how the information was provided; only know that the information is up-to-date and readily available at a click of a button.  Many internal portals will need to have the same capability.  Only those that create, update, and have the authority to manage the record will have access to modify the back-end.

The contractor will also need to plan and execute integration with various agency document portals.  For example, Share Point and Executive Correspondence Tacking Systems will need to connect to the ERDEMS system.  The contractor will need to conduct an appraisal of these systems throughout the Department to determine the impact and scope of this integration.

The contractor will need to work with the DHS Mail Management Division for conversion of physical mail to digital mail and managing of official mail as a record as well as easy access for individual end users receiving digital mail.  The DHS ERDEMS integration covers multiple systems, processes, and applications.  The contractor will need to plan and execute the integration considering the impact, mission risk, and business process for each integration phase.

The Department-wide integration is a multi-year effort.  It is expected to take between 5 to 7 years to successfully plan, execute, and fully implement a Department-wide ERDEMS system.

Alpha and Beta Test
The contactor will need to plan and execute an Alpha and Beta test of the ERDEMS system.  A proof of concept going from physical records to electronic records is not considered a success as many agencies already have implemented an electronic records management system.  An Alpha and Beta test success will be determined by the connection and management of various information systems ability to be successfully managed by the ERDEMS system.  The contractor will need to identify and select Components, their information and business processes and test the information relationship between the various Component information systems and ERDEMS.  As the Alpha and Beta testing prove successful, the Contractor will rollout the integration across a systematic and process approach.  The contractor will need to consider whether Component by Component, or information system by information system is a more effective approach.

The family of hand held signals (HHS) is used for both daytime and nighttime signaling and nighttime signaling in the case of the M127A1.  They are used by all military services.  The star clusters consist of five-star illuminant assemblies and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand-held aluminum launching tube.  The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge.  As shipped, the firing pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing.  Stabilizing fins on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal.  A bolt, which also transfers the initiating charge flash to the propellant, extends into the center of the solid propellant which fills the propulsion assembly.  The illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between.  A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal.  The parachute signals consist of a parachute-suspended illuminant assembly and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand-held aluminum launching tube.  The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge.  As shipped, the firing pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing.  Stabilizing fins on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal.  A bolt, which also transfers the initiating charge flash to the propellant, extends into the center of the solid propellant, which fills the propulsion assembly.  The parachute/illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between them.  The parachute with suspension chords is packed on top of the illuminant, and the tube end is sealed with a cork disk (rocket barrel seal).  A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal.  The propelling charge for both cluster and parachute type signals is Black Powder Propellant.  Black powder is used for the initiating and expelling charge for both cluster and parachute signals.  The No. 209 percussion primer is used in both cluster and parachute signals.<BR><BR>Critical components include magnesium powder, black powder, black powder propellant, the No. 209 percussion primer, and the stabilizing fin assembly.  Critical skills include the ability to handle/store hygroscopic materials, handle/formulate/press pyrotechnic mixtures, and fabrication of metal parts.<BR><BR><BR>Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information:  a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability.

A response to this RFI is required no later than 3:00 PM CST on 23 Feb 09.<br />Description: The 693 Armament Systems Squadron (693 ARSS), Eglin AFB, FL, wants to produce a modified control section for the HARM, AGM-88C, that will help fill capability gaps in our Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) systems and complement today's fleet of F-16C/D. The modifications are required to address the force structure gap until sufficient numbers of 5th generation aircraft and advanced weapons are fielded to assume the SEAD role. The USAF entered into a Cooperative Research and Development (CRAD) Agreement with Raytheon Missile Systems to mature and develop the technology for the HARM Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) Attack Module (HDAM) modification. As a direct result of this CRAD, an approach to satisfy the Air Force's requirement to increase the capability and accuracy of the current HARM, to improve weapon effectiveness, and reduce fratricide and collateral damage in response to the increasingly sophisticated systems now being developed and fielded by potential enemies was realized.<br />Concept: To that end, 693 ARSS is interested in information relating to the following requirements for a potential production program:<br />1) Produce 500 HARM control section modification kits that will: (a) add a Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance capability, (b) increase the current control section Inertial Navigation Set (INS) accuracy, and (c) restructure the current AGM-88C seeker software to migrate the guidance function from the seeker to the control section. <br />2) Meet the requirements of Weapon System Specification 2261672 dated September 18, 2006, Missile Prime Item Development Specification 2261673 dated September 18, 2006, and the Control Section Prime Item Development Specification 2261674 dated September 18, 2006 while maintaining the missile interface as defined by AS-5186C dated April 8, 2003 and AS5108D-C dated August 10, 2001. <br />3) Utilize existing Field Level Support Equipment without modification. <br />4) The HARM with modified control section and seeker software will be employed on the F-16 Block 50/52 aircraft utilizing the current LAU-118 launcher which includes the Aircraft Launcher Interface Computer (ALIC). <br />5) No modification of aircraft hardware or software will be allowed. <br />6) No modification of the ALIC hardware or software will be allowed. <br />7) Delivery of modified control sections must begin 18 months following contract award.<br />Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:<br />&bull; Provide information outlining your capabilities and your approach to satisfying the above requirement, to include: <br />o Evidence and/or a proposed plan that all technology elements of the design approach will meet a minimum of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, as defined by the Air Armament Center.<br />o Evidence and/or a proposed plan that manufacturing readiness for the design approach and associated production readiness factors will be at least a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 8, appropriate for production of a system, as defined by the Air Armament Center.<br />o Evidence to enter into testing, to include aircraft integration testing, and associated F-16 aircraft development test and evaluation testing, 12 months after contract award.<br />o Evidence to meet ramp rate of 5 units 18 months after award, 15 units the next month, and 20 units for each of the remaining 24 months.<br />&bull; Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for non-recurring engineering, to include acceptance testing of factory test equipment; test and evaluation, including qualification and ALIC interface testing; and production of 500 modified control sections.<br />&bull; Assumptions regarding any Government furnished material and/or equipment.<br />Disclaimer: This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

More information about the Hydraulics Lab at Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center and its current research can be found at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/engineering/hydraulics/research/lab.cfm. 

Smart particles refers to a network of tiny sensors, connected wirelessly to each other, which can also transmit data to a receiving device in nearly real-time.  The size of the individual sensor devices, called motes is generally less than one cubic centimeter, though some motes may be larger and others are much smaller.  Motes can be outfitted with a wide range of sensor types.  

This market research meeting seeks to address the use of a smart particle network(s) to perform in-situ hydraulic research.  For example, a potential application is the monitoring scour around bridge piers and other submerged structures in real time.  One significant problem is the inability of existing scour measurement devices to study scour during storms and high flow events.  This meeting seeks to determine the ability of mobile, smart particle networks to perform hydraulic research tasks such as monitoring the shape of the riverbed and scour holes, mapping the velocity of the waterbody, monitoring changes in pressure, and other potential tasks.  Initial testing would occur at the FHWAs Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center.  An RFP may be issued in the future to provide components and support for a prototype hydrodynamic sensor network.  Further hydraulics research applications may also be discussed.  

Developing motes of minimum possible size is not of great importance, but the sensors must have neutral buoyancy, be able to operate in turbulent, high velocity, turbid water, and be able, while moving, to transmit data to a receiving device during potentially extreme meteorological conditions.  The sensors should be capable of monitoring position, velocity, pressure, and other potential environmental variables.  Potential designs and solutions for building the sensor network of motes, data acquisition solutions, mote software/operating systems, and networks will be discussed at the meeting.  

This market research meeting will be moderated by an interagency government review panel composed of members with experience and interest in smart particle networks and related fields.  Potential vendors will be given the opportunity to present their preliminary ideas on developing the hardware and software components needed for the type of hydraulic research described above.  

Interested vendors should comment on the feasibility of developing the smart sensor network, with discussion including but not limited to: hardware and mote construction, instrumentation, networking, programming, scale of implementation, data output capabilities, and cost.

In addition, interested parties should be prepared to discuss potential stumbling blocks and barriers to development and deployment of proposed systems as well as strategies for mitigation.  These may include but are not limited to: availability of technology, cost, differences between lab and field application, critical system failure modes, reproducibility, and external effects including hazardous materials release, environmental concerns, interference with and damage to existing systems and infrastructure.  

This market research meeting presents two opportunities for participation:

1. Interested Vendors  Organizations, firms or individuals with expertise in the development of smart particle networks may be invited to give a short presentation detailing their current level of capability and/or preliminary ideas for development.  Presentation length will be determined based on the number of interested presenters.  The review panel and other meeting participants will then be permitted to ask questions to the interested vendors.
2. Meeting Participants  Interested parties without current capability to be a vendor may attend the meeting.  They may be permitted to ask questions to presenters, participate in group discussions, and network with other participants.

Meeting Details: The market research meeting will be convened as a one-day conference for the discussion of the current feasibility of developing smart particle sensor networks for hydraulic research.  The meeting will be held at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research in McLean, VA.

Interested attendees should express their desire to attend the meeting by sending an email to lars.hanson@fhwa.dot.gov.  Due to limited space, no more than two persons per organization may attend.  

In addition, interested vendors should send a one page abstract detailing the key points of their presentation.  (Abstracts will be evaluated by FHWA and the review panel to decide which interested vendors will present at the meeting.  Abstracts may be posted for public review unless the vendor declines.  Alternatively, vendors may provide two abstracts: one for the review panel, and one that will be posted for public viewing.)  Interested vendors should also provide a short description (3 pages or less) of their organization, and its capabilities, and past and current projects/research pertaining to smart particles, as well biographical information about the presenters.  They should be prepared to provide an electronic copy of their presentation as the meeting date approaches.  

After the meeting, vendors that give presentations will be asked to submit a white paper for inclusion in the meeting report.  All other attendees may submit white papers if they desire.  The final meeting report, including these white papers and recommendations of the review panel, will be made available for public viewing at a later date after the meeting concludes.

The date of this market research meeting is currently projected to be at the end of May or early June.  A further announcement will advertise the date of the meeting.  

Not responding to this announcement or not attending the market search meeting does not preclude participation in any further RFPs, if any are issued. This meeting is convened to assess the level of interest and capabilities of all interested parties.

<DESC>Brand Name Justification for Intent to Sole Source


The GSA (General Services Administration), Heartland Global Supply, FAS intends to award a brand name order based on the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) for National Stock Number (NSN) 5180-01-075-0766.  The IPD (Item Purchase Description) is written IAW (in accordance with) a brand name part number.  GSA has determined that this brand name part number is the only item that will meet the requirements of this NSN.  GSA manages this NSN and procures this NSN on behalf of our customers.  There are several distributors of Alcoa brand name parts.  

The brand name justification is as follows:  NSN 5180-01-075-0766 is a brand name item, written IAW with Alcoa Global Fasteners, Inc. (Division of Rosan) part number KM30.  This Fluid Adapter Tool Kit is used to install/remove Rosan fluid fittings, (adapters, check valves, filters, quick disconnects and reducers) with size 06 port end.  This kit is used on H-1 helicopters, models AH-1W, UH-1N, AG-1Z and UH-1Y, with hydraulic systems operating between 1500 and 3000 PSI.

Rosan fittings are designed to function as unions with one end connected to the port of a unit and the other end connected to the tube assemblies, per NAVAIR 01-1A-20, aviation hose and tube manual.  This item is in support of peculiar support equipment not common to civilian type aircraft.

The above outlines and justifies this brand name item IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), 13.106-1(b)(3), 5.102(a)(6) and 11.105(a)(3).  Since the anticipated cost is under the simplified acquisition threshold, FAR 13.106-(b)(2), 13.5 and 6.302-1(c) do not apply.

This is not a solicitation or request for quote.

The GSA has only one brand name item for this procurement that is in the Governments best interest.  If there are any other potential items, submit your capability statement via email to Fran Bock-Waldo, Contract Specialist, at fran.bock-waldo@gsa.gov, no later than COB 4/9/09.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has awarded a sole source contract for dental imaging software that is able to integrate with GENDEX intra-oral sensors and the Veterans Health Information System Technology Architecture (VistA) Imaging (VI) System using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) v 3 protocols.  A fixed price contract was awarded.  It is the Government's belief that only Lead Technologies, Inc. d/b/a Medicor Imaging possessed the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation or a request for information; it is notice of a sole source contract award.JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALVA241-P-1142DENTAL IMAGING SOFTWARESOLE SOURCE AWARDJUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION	1.  Identification of (1) the agency and (2) the contracting activity:(1) Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, Jamaica Plains, MA (VABHCS)(2) Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, 940 Belmont Street, Brockton, MA  02301   2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:Purchase dental imaging software with the following capabilities:1.	Able to integrate hardware from multiple vendors, particularly GENDEX intra-oral sensors,  with the VABHCS Veteran's Health Information System Technology Architecture (VistA) hospital information system and approved for integration with the VistA Imaging (VI) System using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) v 3 protocols;2.	Accept dental images from other Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) medical centers3.	Accept dental images from DOD sources.4.	Integrate those images with the with the Document Storage Systems Dental record Manager Plus (DRM+) dental treatment record system.5.	Display the radiographs from the GENDEX sensors in proper orientationPurchase the installation and support of the above software.3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the  agency's needs (including the estimated value):		MiPACS software and licensing:			Total Number of MiPACS Storage Server Licenses: 1MiPACS Dental Enterprise Viewer Client Licenses: 50Total Number of Exams: UnlimitedDICOM Query and Retrieve: UnlimitedImage Forwarding Capabilities EnabledDisabled -Network Load Balancing Capabilities Failover Clustering IMPLEMENTATION (INSTALLATION AND TRAINING)			The MiPACS Dental Enterprise Storage Server will be installed on a VABHCS-supplied server and integrated with the VI system using the DICOM v 3 protocols. The MiPACS Dental Enterprise Viewer software will be installed at VABHCS dental service workstations as necessary to the maximum number licensed. This installation will include integration with existing (GENDEX intra-oral, panoramic, and film scanning) digital radiograph devices and other imaging devices as available and described as supported on: http://www.medicorimaging.com/dental/dentalviewer-hardware.htm"	INSTALLATION: Installations will be performed on-site visit by one or more Medicor engineers to implement and configure the MiPACS Enterprise Imaging Solution components. "	TRAINING:Medicor will provide four (4) days of on-site training for "training the trainers" divided between the Jamaica Plain and Brockton campuses. The duration may exceed four (4) days if necessary to integrate the MiPACS with the BHCS VistA and VI systems.  The training support materials customary in commercial practice, i.e. documentation, reference guides, "cheat sheets", training videos, etc., for use during the onsite training and subsequent training sessions will be included.POST INSTALLATION SITE VISIT 		One or more Medicor engineers will visit BHCS between one (1) and three (3) months after the MiPACS Digital system is brought live.  In the course of this visit, the engineer(s) will optimize Imaging Enterprise system performance and training.This will include one or more of the following, as agreed to at that time:? Check the MiPACS Storage Server Health? Check the Image Storage Server Health? Verify that the appropriate back-up and recovery procedures are functioning properly? Ensure that adequate image storage space is available in order to hold the digital images for the desired number of years? Review administrative procedures used at the site? Adjust the image capturing work-flow if needed? Re-calibrate the capture devices to achieve optimal diagnostic image quality? Offer additional training on the system components as needed? Answer any questions by the IT staff or by the system users 4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting otherthan full and open competition:FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority sited:			The proposed contractor offers the only solution which meets all of the requirements, including the requirements for compatibility with VI and displaying the GENDEX sensor data in the proper orientation.6.   Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be published: The MiPACS software is the only product which meets the requirements stated in Paragraph 2, particularly the integration of sensors and devices from multiple vendors, accepting dental imaging from DOD sources, and approved integration with VI. It is a proprietary product available from the developer. See Item 8.	 7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated     cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  Cost determination will be made after solicitation and prior to award.8.	Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names, of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.A market survey was conducted by Eleonore Paunovich, DDS, MS; Dental Imaging Consultant Office of Dentistry and reported in the paper "VA DENTAL DIGITAL IMAGING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS" last issued in March, 2007. (Dr. Paunovich leads the digital dental imaging research for the Department of Veteran's Affairs.) 9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. No other software has been approved for integration with VistA Imaging and can be successfully used with different makes of hardware including the GENDEX sensors in use at VA, Boston Healthcare System. The only other software claiming to be usable with the GENDEX sensor does not always present the sensor data in the correct orientation. This misreprepresentation of the acquired image increases the chance of patient harm, and the software does not integrate with the DRM+ software, so other software alternatives are unacceptable to the VA, Boston Healthcare System.The requested software is employed in other VA facilities, thereby simplifying information interchange at both the VI and workstation levels.The requested software has been deployed world-wide by the U.S. Air Force in its dental clinics and is being considered for deployment by the U.S. Navy. 10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  None11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.The VI development team will continue to test dental software as presented to it. The VA Imaging Consultant for Dentistry will continue to monitor dental software approved for integration with the VI system.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.         Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295. 2.         Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for Mental Health Care Services - Wisconsin Rapids, WI for Tomah VAMC.  Procurement will proceed on a sole source basis. 3.         A description of supplies/services required:  Tomah VAMC has a requirement for Mental Health Counseling services in the Wisconsin Rapids, WI area for approximately 140 veterans for the period April 1, 2009 through September 30, 2009 with one 6 month option to extend through March 31, 2010.    4.         Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)). 5.         Facilities Unique Qualifications:  Tomah VAMC currently has a contract in place with Clinical Services for Mental Health Counseling Services in the Wisconsin Rapids, WI, area.  Clinical Services has been providing Mental Health Services for the Tomah VAMC for the past 3  years and performance has been satisfactory.  The providers at Clinical Services have developed a therapeutic bond with their patients and to break this bond may be detrimental to the veteran's health.  This contractor is familiar with VA requirements and would require no additional training.  In addition, there would be no break in services provided to veterans.             6.         Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  Market Research was conducted to determine if there were any SDVOSB or VOSB that were capable of providing these services through Vetbiz.gov and the SBA Small Business Dynamic Search Tool.  No vendors were found.  It is not feasible from a patient care standpoint to award a six-month or even one year Mental Health Counseling contract to another contractor.  Doing this would impair the therapeutic bond between veterans and current counselors and there would likely be discontinuation of treatment for some veterans who remain in need of the clinical services obtained through this counselor.   7.         Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  The pricing will be comparable to the expiring contract, but may include a slight increase to incorporate inflation or cost of living.  The price of the current contract has been the same for 3  years. 8.         Market survey conducted:  Market Research has been conducted by the contracting officer and conditions have essentially stayed the same since the previous contract award.  Clinical Services was the only vendor that responded to the previous unrestricted solicitation.  An "Intent to Sole Source" to Clinical Services was posted on January 28, 2009 with responses due close of business February 2, 2009.   No responses were received by that date and even by today's date, February 10, 2009.      9.         Other sources expressing an interest:  None 10.        Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None.   11.        Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. BECKY CINCOTTAContracting Officer

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements. <br /><br />Factor 6 - Diversity. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

All contractor/subcontractor employees shall exit via the Main Gate.

Any vehicle entering the base is subject to inspection at any time. Refusal may result in the individual being temporarily or permanently barred from the base.</p>
<p>(b) All contractors/subcontractors are subject to criminal background checks prior to being allowed on base to work. Contractors/subcontractors will not be issued passes prior to submitting to background checks and being cleared by Security Forces Squadron (approximately a two week period).

Contractors must report missing employees with passes. Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.

<p>(e) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.</p>

Responses must be sent electronically in MS Word format to Lucille.Lee@cms.hhs.gov and in hard copy no later than 11:00am on April 8, 2009 to Lucille Lee and  Louis Anderson, Office of Acquisitions and Grants Management, Mail stop C2-21-15, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD  21244.  Responses shall be no more than five pages and shall include the following: 1) Contractors plan to perform the Statement of Work; 2) Past performance information - relevant experience to perform the required services; and 3) fully loaded labor rate and anticipated hours.  All responses will be evaluated on a best value basis. The government intends to award an order to the responsible offeror whose quotation offers the best combination of technical capabilities and proposed price; the best value (considering price and other factors). All responses/quotes submitted shall remain valid for a period of 180 days. For the purpose of establishing timely receipt of a quotation, the time will be established based upon the hard copy submission.  Offerors are advised that CMS is a secured facility and therefore, offerors should allow time to obtain the appropriate security clearances (e.g., parking pass, visitor badge, etc). Vendors are also advised that the CMS mailroom accepts only U.S. Postal Service mail. When utilizing an overnight carrier, you are cautioned that you must allow time for the proposal to be delivered to the exact mail stop noted above by the carrier by the time specified in this RFQ.  Interested parties must be able to affirm no conflicts of interest with parties involved in Medicare claims processing in light of the work identified in this Statement of Work.  In the event that the vendor/government identifies a conflict or the appearance of a conflict, the vendor shall be responsible for providing a mitigation strategy that satisfies the government. In the event that the conflict cannot be resolved, the order cannot be awarded or an existing order may need to be terminated.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">This is a combined commercial synopsis/solicitation, (HSFEEM-09-Q-0025) supplemented with additional information included herein (SOW Attached). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for quotes, as a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms for up to a total of 128 "room nights" for participants attending the FY 2009 Homeland Security Preparedness Technical Assistance Program (HSPTAP)/Enhancing Grants Management Technical Assistance (EGMTA) Program Workshop in Los Angeles, CA. DHS/FEMA has scheduled the conference for June 2-3, 2009. The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be capable of offering facilities accommodating up to approximately 60 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only. Participants will call the hotel/motel at least 21 days prior to the conference date to reserve their room. Callers will identify themselves as participants (attendees) in the "FY 2009 FEMA EGMTA Workshop," and give the hotel/motel the dates for which they will require lodging. Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to pay for their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. The "Grand Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which the conference will be held. The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms should be structured in a format that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order. Offerors should also provide a copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest cost offeror representing the best value to the Government. Upon conclusion of the conference and final determination of final costs such as costs expected to be but not covered by the attendees, conference facilities/space, and costs associated with audio-visual requirements if not included with package quote, will be covered under the commercial purchase order to be issued by the Government in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms to be paid for by the Federal Government. Quotes shall be inclusive of the per-night cost per room, a sub-total cost indicating the cost for each of the night periods separately, and a Grand Total for the entire period. In order to be considered for award, the offer must be determined to be technically acceptable. Quotes shall only be accepted from actual hotels and will not be accepted from third party conference planning/service businesses. Award will be made to the offeror who is technically acceptable with the lowest price. To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror's quotation will be subjected to the following "Go/No Go" criteria:<br /><br />(1) The offeror must demonstrate ability to provide the requested number of guest rooms/nights and associated conference facilities as described in the SOW on the dates indicated, and (2) The offeror must be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. </span></p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION FOR ARCIS INTEGRATED LABEL FORM

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation Number is NAMA-09-Q-0034 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The NAICS code for this requirement is 323116.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition circular 2005-32 effective date March 31, 2009.  The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract with fixed unit pricing.  Prices must be fixed unit composite prices for providing the supplies specified herein and must include the cost for all supervision; direct labor; equipment; materials; shipping to NARAs Federal Records Centers (FRCs); overhead; other direct costs; subcontracts; general and administrative expenses (G&A); and profit. The anticipated award date of the resulting contract is May 20, 2009.  The Government intends to make a selection decision based on its review of initial quotations without discussions for this procurement.  Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation as prescribed by FAR 12.301(c)(2).  Award will be made to the vendor whose conforming quotation represents the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation.  Technical acceptability will be determined by the vendor's ability to meet the technical requirements of the Statement of Work/Specifications.  In order to evaluate technical acceptability, vendors must submit five (5) sample forms that will be tested for conformance to specifications outlined in this requirement. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation, which will be considered by NARA. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. The resulting order(s) will be an indefinite quantity delivery order(s) that utilizes fixed unit prices for the purpose of effectuating the order.  The Government guarantees that it will place an order for, at the very least, the minimum quantity in each CLIN with the successful vendor(s) that has supplied a label which passes testing.  The initial order, or orders, if multiple awards are made, will be placed following receipt and evaluation of quotations.  NARA may issue additional orders to the winning vendors during the delivery order term up to the Maximum Quantity listed for the pertinent CLIN.  For evaluation purposes, the ceiling price of the contract will be determined by multiplying Unit Prices entered by the Maximum Quantity of the pertinent CLIN with respect to the unit price.  The period of performance is as follows:  Base Period - June 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010 for CLIN 0001 and 0002; Option Period 1 - June 1, 2010 to May 31, 2011 for CLINs 0003 and 0004; Option Period 2 - June 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012 for CLINs 0005 and 0006; Option Period 3 - June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 for CLINs 0007 and 0008; and Option Period 4 - June 1, 201 to May 31, 2014 for CLINs 0009 and 0010.

DESCRIPTION:  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) serves American democracy by safeguarding and preserving the records of our Government, ensuring that the people can discover, use, and learn from this documentary heritage.  We ensure continuing access to the essential documentation of the rights of American citizens and the actions of their government.  We support democracy, promote civic education, and facilitate historical understanding of our national experience.  NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries.  In support of its mission, NARA has established a Federal Record Center Program (FRCP) that provides high-quality, cost-effective storage and servicing of temporary textual records in Federal Record Centers (FRC) located throughout the United States.  See Attachment B, Facility Information for the location of these facilities.  The FRCP has been in existence since the early 1950s, however under the direction of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA instituted a fee-for-service revolving fund on October 1, 1999, for its records centers storage and servicing operation.  Key statistics about the FRCP:17 facilities throughout the United States; total holdings of 25 million cubic feet of records; 13 million reference requests serviced annually; 18,000 tons of paper recycled annually; professional staff of approximately 1,100 Federal employees; and nearly 400 Federal agency customers.  The FRCP program uses a number of legacy IT applications that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s that support the management and operations of NARAs vision to become the record center service provider of choice for the Federal Government.  In order to achieve this vision, NARA must transition to the most current technologies, automate processes, provide online support thus leading to heightened customer satisfaction, and lower operating costs.  The FRCP has been developing Archives and Records Center Information System (ARCIS) using Siebel 7.8 CRM software to replace these outdated systems.  ARCIS will support streamlined business processes, thereby saving money, and better serving our customers.  The ARCIS system has been in development for three years starting with the completion of the Concept of Operations document completed in July 2005.  A key system capability of ARCIS is the capability to track assets and transactions across functions and have the flexibility to track at different levels such as the box or folder level.  ARCIS will use barcodes to manage space inventory, manage assets, and provide transaction control.  The production system of ARCIS began in September 2008 and continues until October 2009.  The objective of this requirement is to obtain the services of a Vendor to develop and provide blank Integrated Label Forms (ILFs) to be used in conjunction with the ARCIS application throughout the FRCP.  An ILF is a business form having a removable label.  The label is made from a paper ply and a piece of transfer tape.  The Vendor is tasked with all aspects of the ARCIS ILF to include: (1) Manufacture Integrated Label Forms: (a) Design, develop and produce the standard ILF (Base Period).  The Vendor shall manufacture an ILF to meet specifications as shown in Attachment A, Integrated Label Form (ILF) Specifications to be printed on the printer (or similar) as shown in Attachment C, Laser Printer Specifications; and (b) Design or modify ILFs (Option Periods).  It is possible that during the term of the contract, FRCP business needs will require the ILF to be redesigned or new ILFs created.  For example, the FRCP may need an ILF that is half size (5.5 inches by 8.5 inches) with a smaller peelable label.  The Vendor shall design new ILFs to meet NARA business requirements and then manufacture, and supply in accordance with the terms and conditions of this requirement.  The vendor shall deliver five (5) samples of the redesigned or modified ILFs thirty days after receiving the requirement document.  (2) Maintain and supply stock of integrated label forms: The Vendor shall maintain an inventory of ILFs to meet the needs of the FRCP program.  (a) Deliver initial supply (Base Period).  The Vendor shall deliver within thirty days of contract award a 90-day supply of ILFs to each FRC as shown in Attachment B, Facility Information; (b) Provide ordering instructions (Base Period).  The Vendor shall develop written instructions to be issued by the COR to each FRC to order replacement ILFs.  Instructions shall include a phone number, fax number and/or email address to be used by the FRCP for ordering information.  The vendor shall deliver the instructions to the COR twenty days after contract award.  Generally, each FRC shall place ILF orders in monthly increments; and (c) Supply ILFs (Base Period and Option Periods).  The Vendor shall deliver ILFs as ordered by each FRC on a monthly basis.  Estimates of monthly usage are shown in Attachment B, Facility Information; however, there is no guarantee of actual usage since this will depend on the success of ARCIS with the FRCP customers.  ILFs shall be received within five (5) business days of ordering by the facility.  GENERAL:  (1) The Vendor shall provide all management, administrative, clerical, and supervisory functions required for the effective and efficient performance of this contract. The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant purchase order: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jun 2008); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Feb 2009) - vendors shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the vendor has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210. The reference number for this Request for Quote (RFQ) is 38130AS03. 

The National Geospatial Intelligence-Agency has a requirement for software AND SOFTWARE maintenance agreements as outlined below. NGA plans to issue a sole source, firm fixed price Purchase Order to:  Vintara Inc., 1433 Webster St., Suite 201, Oakland, CA 94612.  The Purchase Order will be issued under FAR Parts 12 and 13. The statutory authority is the test program for commercial items (Section 4202 of the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996). Vintara has proprietary rights to the software code for the Vintara products associated with this requirement and is the only known source that can provide this maintenance support. No other vendor or distributor can legally obtain access to the software and no other vendor can make duplicate copies since it is protected by copyright and patent laws. The requirement is for 
BRAND NAME VINTARA SOFTWARE and MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS as listed below:

1) Quantity of 590, Vintara ISO9 Software User Licenses 

2) Quantity of 590, Vintara ISO9 Software Maintenance Agreements    Note that the estimated Period of Performance for this maintenance is 09 April 2009  26 September 2009.  This is due to the fact that we are co-terminating the maintenance on these licenses to match up with other currently held licenses. 
 
All of the items referenced in this posting are proprietary products of Vintara Inc.  Vintara is the only web based software application that has all three required certifications built in, i.e., ISO 9000, ISO 20000, and ISO 27000.  Furthermore, Vintara is the only software that seamlessly integrates within unique NGA systems.  No other software meets the minimum requirements of NGA at this time.  In addition, due to the fact that this software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise it would be extremely costly to switch to a new type of software. Personnel would have to be trained to use the new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to implementation of the new software. The Vintara suite of software is the only product that fulfills the form, fit, and function requirements of NGA at this time. Vendor's that respond to this solicitation must be authorized resellers of Vintara Inc. Vendor shall quote all or none of the listed items. 

Delivery is FOB Destination. Delivery will be made to the following location: (1) NGA Attn: Sheri Jones MS L-051, 3838 Vogel Rd, Arnold, MO 63010. Total cost shall include all shipping and handling. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, with no obligation to the vendor by the Government. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Vendors are required to submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification--Commercial Items, with their offer. The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31 effective March 19, 2009. The requirement will be Set Aside for Small Business if two (2) or more qualified Small Businesses submit quotes. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325120, which has a Small Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees and shall remain open for responsible sources to respond. Contractors are required to identify their companys business size.  TSA plans to establish a single no cost BPA to fulfill this requirement; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any BPA and does not guarantee any order placements.

BACKGROUND

The Helium and Nitrogen gases are used to operate the DART system which is located in the Canine Explosives Branchs chemistry laboratory.  The DART is a Mass Spectrometer system that is used to analyze trace amounts of substances.  The DART cannot operate without these two gases.  The gas cylinders must be 9 (diameter) x 56 (height) because the cage and hookups for these gases were specifically configured to fit this cylinder size. The Helium gas purity grade MUST be UHP Plus 99.999%.  The Nitrogen gas purity MUST be Ultra Hi Purity 99.9995%.  These purity grades must be used to eliminate interference with unknown samples and to reduce contamination.  The contractor is required to deliver the specified amount of gas cylinders required and pick up the empty gas cylinders that have been consumed. The amount of gases consumed per month depends on how frequently the DART is used by the chemist.

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31 effective March 19, 2009. The requirement will be a Full and Open Competition. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990, which has a Small Business Size Standard of $7.0M shall remain open for responsible sources to respond.

BACKGROUND

In a continuing effort to reinforce security at GA airports, TSA will allocate funding to promote the use of the GA Secure Hotline, augment the current GA Grant Feasibility Study, and begin development of a framework for an airport security grant program. 

The GA Secure Hotline was instituted to provide a reporting mechanism for suspicious and security related activity at GA airports.  In the past the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) has developed marketing and promotional materials to distribute to 650,000 general aviation airport and aircraft operators, both members and non-members of AOPA.  TSA has previously funded the mailing services provided by AOPA to members of the general aviation community.

TSA completed a general aviation (GA) grant program feasibility study in December 2007 to answer the requirement in Section 161 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act), Public Law 110-53, signed on August 3, 2007.  In order to further justify the implementation of a grant program, further study and analysis is required.

Volume II Contents (5 pages): 
Factor 4.0  Price Information   

All proposed prices will be evaluated via a Price Analysis to determine reasonableness and realism. The Government shall evaluate the Offerors proposed prices to determine that they are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offerors technical proposal and are reasonable as compared to the Governments Independent Government Cost Estimate and other Offerors proposals.  

The proposal of each offeror determined to be technically acceptable or which could, after discussion (if applicable), be made technically acceptable, will be subject to a price realism analysis.  The price proposal will be evaluated to determine overall reasonableness and realism.

Price reasonableness and realism pertains to the offeror's ability to project prices which are reasonable and which indicate the offeror's understanding of the nature and the scope of the work to be performed. The Government considers that a fully justified and realistic proposal is of paramount importance in evaluating price proposals.  Any proposal lacking these attributes, regardless of its relative position with other proposals, will be considered lacking realism.  

In performing the price analysis, the Government may request supporting information from each offeror to substantiate the rationale for their proposed prices

If the Government determines after the analysis that the proposed price(s) are unrealistically low, these unrealistic prices will be considered in the risk assessment.  If the offerors technical proposal is within the competitive range, the Government will require the offeror to:

	Demonstrate an understanding of the requirement for which unrealistic costs/prices are proposed; 

	Demonstrate the capability to absorb the price differential between low costs/prices proposed and the probable real cost to meet the Governments requirements;

	Demonstrate an understanding that performance under a resultant contract will be carefully assessed to ensure that the appropriate caliber of support is provided. 

SOURCE SELECTION:  The Government intends to award a competitive Firm Fixed Priced Contract to the Contractor whose proposal, conforming to the combined/synopsis, represents the best value solution using a Trade-Off analysis. The Best Value Approach is a method of selecting the proposal that presents the best value to the Government, based on evaluation of each offer in the areas of Technical and Management Approach, GA Knowledge/Stakeholder Relationships & Experience/Past Performance and Price. The Source Selection Authority (SSA) may determine that a superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the Government. The SSA, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposals relative capability.

The Government may: 
(1) Reject any or all submittals if such action is in the public interest; 
(2) Accept other than the lowest price submittal; and, 
(3) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 

Proposals that do not respond to all requirements in the solicitation may be rejected without further evaluation, deliberation, or discussion. The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be significantly not compliant with the solicitation requirements, unrealistically high or low in price, or reflects a failure to comprehend the requirement. 

The Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror, or other than the Offeror with the highest non-price rating. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions with Offerors. If the government determines that discussions are necessary, the government reserves the right to establish a competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306(c). The government reserves the right to limit the competitive range for efficiency.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

Contractors must follow policies and procedures outlined in VA Directive 6500, Information Security Program and its handbooks to ensure appropriate security controls are in place.Access to VA Information and VA Information SystemsA contractor shall request logical (technical) and/or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary: (1) to perform the services specified in the contract, (2) to perform necessary maintenance functions for electronic storage or transmission media necessary for performance of the contract, and (3) for individuals who first satisfy the same conditions, requirements and restrictions that comparable VA employees must meet in order to have access to the same type of VA information.  All contractors and subcontractors working with VA Sensitive Information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of regular VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.  The level of background security investigation will be in accordance with VA Directive 0710, Handbook 0710, which are available at:  http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/  and VHA Directive 0710 and implementing Handbook 0710.01 which are available at: http://www1.va.gov/vhapublications/index.cfm.  Contractors are responsible for screening their employees.  The following are VAs approved policy exceptions for meeting VAs background screenings/investigative requirements for certain types of contractors:Contract personnel not accessing VA information resources such as personnel hired to maintain the medical facility grounds, construction contracts, utility system contractors, etc.,Contract personnel with limited and intermittent access to equipment connected to facility networks on which no VA sensitive information is available, including contractors who install, maintain, and repair networked building equipment such as fire alarm; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment; elevator control systems, etc.  If equipment to be repaired is located within sensitive areas (e.g. computer room/communications closets) VA IT staff must escort contractors while on site.Contract personnel with limited and intermittent access to equipment connected to facility networks on which limited VA sensitive information may reside, including medical equipment contractors who install, maintain, and repair networked medical equipment such as CT scanners, EKG systems, ICU monitoring, etc.  In this case, Veterans Health Administration facilities must have a duly executed VA business associate agreement (BAA) in place with the vendor in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associates, to assure compliance with the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in addition to the contract.  Contract personnel, if on site, should be escorted by VA IT staff.Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.  National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry safeguards the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.  Defense Security Service (DSS) administers the NISP on behalf of the Department of Defense and 23 other federal agencies within the Executive Branch.  VA will verify clearance through DSS.VA Information Custodial RequirementsInformation made available to the contractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the contracting officer.  This clause expressly limits the contractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d)(1).Information generated by a Contractor as a part of the contractors normal business operations, such as medical records created in the course of providing treatment, is subject to a review by the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to determine if the information is the property of VA and subject to VA policy.  If the information is determined by OGC to not be the property of VA, the restrictions required for VA information will not apply.VA information will not be co-mingled with any other data on the contractors/subcontractors information systems/media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met.  VA also reserves the right to conduct IT resource inspections to ensure data separation and on-site inspection of information destruction/media sanitization procedures to ensure they are in compliance with VA policy requirements.Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor will not destroy information received from VA or gathered or created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA contracting officer.  Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, and applicable VA Records Control Schedules.The contractor will receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  Applicable Federal information security regulations include all Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and Special Publications (SP) issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies, including FIPS or SP, in this contract. Contractors collecting, storing, or disseminating personal identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) data must conform to all pertinent regulations, laws, and VA directives related to privacy.  Contractors must provide access for VA privacy reviews and assessments and provide appropriate documentation as directed.The contractor shall not make copies of VA information except as necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated business associate agreement (BAA) will also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01 Business Associates.  Contractor will store, transport or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using a VA-approved encryption application that meets the requirements of NISTs FIPS 140-2 standard.  The contractors firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VAs minimum requirements.  VA directives are available on the VA directives Web site at http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VAs prior written approval.  The contractor will refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.  Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor shall not release medical quality assurance records protected by 38 U.S.C. 5705 or records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus protected under 38 U.S.C. 7332 under any circumstances, including in response to a court order, and shall immediately refer such court orders or other inquiries to the VA contracting officer for response.  The contractor will not use technologies banned in VA in meeting the requirements of the contract (e.g., Bluetooth enabled devices).Information System Design and DevelopmentInformation systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities shall comply with all VA policies developed in accordance with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems.  This includes standards for the protection of electronic PHI, outlined in 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C, information and system security categorization level designations in accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200 with implementation of all baseline security controls commensurate with the FIPS 199 system security categorization (reference Appendix D of VA Handbook 6500, VA Information Security Program).  During the development cycle a privacy impact assessment will be completed, provided to the COTR, and approved by the VA Privacy Service in accordance with VA Privacy Impact Assessment Handbook 6500.3.The security controls must be designed, developed, approved by VA, and implemented in accordance with the provisions of VA security system development life cycle as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-37 and VA Handbook 6500.The contractor will be required to design, develop, or operate a System of Records on individuals to accomplish an agency function subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, (as amended), Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 U.S.C.552a) and applicable agency regulations. Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of criminal and civil penalties.The contractor agrees to -(1) Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies --(i) The systems of records; and(ii) The design, development, or operation work that the contractor is to perform;(2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals that is subject to the Act; and,(3) Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph (3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a system of records.In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function.  For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the contractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.(1) Operation of a system of records means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the system of records, including the collection, use, and dissemination of records.(2) Record means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and contains the persons name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph.(3) System of records on individuals means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.Information System Hosting, Operation, Maintenance or Use    For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks.  The contractor security control procedures must be identical, not equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems.  A privacy impact assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval.  All external Internet connections involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of personally identifiable information, as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA.  These security controls need to be stated within the PIA and supported by a risk assessment.  If these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.Outsourcing (contractor facility/contractor equipment/contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (C&A) of the contractors systems in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-37 and VA Handbook 6500 and a privacy impact assessment of the contractors systems prior to operation of the systems.  Government-owned (government facility/government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require a system interconnection agreement and a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which detail what data types will be shared, who will have access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.The contractor must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA.  Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the information security officer (ISO) for entry into VAs Plan of Action and Milestone (POA&M) management process.  The contractor will use VAs POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities.  Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the Government.  Contractor procedures will be subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials.  The physical security aspects associated with contractor activities will also be subject to such assessments.  As updates to the system occur, an updated PIA must be submitted to the VA Privacy Service through the COTR for approval.All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA sensitive information must have all VA sensitive information removed, cleared, sanitized, or destroyed in accordance with VA policies and procedures upon:  (1) completion or termination of the contract or (2) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor, whichever is earlier. Security Incident Investigation The term security incident means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) and simultaneously, the designated ISO/Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor has access.To the extent known by the contractor, the contractors notice to VA will identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information/assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor considers relevant.  The contractor will simultaneously report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity(ies) of jurisdiction, including the VA Offices of the Inspector General and Security and Law Enforcement, in instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity.  The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees will cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident.  The contractor will cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.  To the extent practicable, the contractor shall mitigate any harmful effects on individuals whose VA information was accessed or disclosed in a security incident.  In the event of a data breach with respect to any VA Sensitive Information processed or maintained by the contractor or subcontractor under the contract, the contractor is responsible for liquidated damages to be paid to VA. Security Controls Compliance TestingOn a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract.  With 10 working-days notice, at the request of the Government, the contractor will fully cooperate and assist in a Government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General.  The Government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.  TrainingAll contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA networks:(1)	Sign and acknowledge understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the attached National Rules of Behavior relating to access to VA information and information systems;(2)	Successfully complete VA Cyber Security Awareness training and annual refresher training as required;(3)	Successfully complete VA General Privacy training and annual refresher training as required; and(4)	Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document  e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer a copy of the training certificates for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.  These online courses are located at the following web site:  https://www.ees-learning.net/.Failure to complete this mandatory training within the timeframe required will be grounds for suspension or termination of all physical and/or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training is completed. Electronic Payment(s)The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-- Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.  EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.  Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.  ELECTRONIC INVOICE SUBMISSION To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.

<DESC><p> Below are the questions NIH has received in regard to solicitation NIHOD2009117.  After each question is the answer that has been provided by either the Fleet Management Division of the Office of Acquisitions.  In addition to the information below, NIH feels that the following additional information is relevant to the solicitation and vendor's efforts in submitting an appropriate and comprehensive proposal:</p>
<p>&bull;	All service and maintenance in relation to this contract will be performed at the contractor's location.  Contractors will only be allowed onto NIH facilities for the purpose of pick-up/drop-off of vehicle(s).<br />&bull;	NIH will not publicize its list of vehicles. Of the estimated 280 vehicles that make up NIH's fleet, approximately 50% of the vehicles have been manufactured since 1999.  The other 50% of the fleet were manufactured 1990 and 1998.<br />&bull;	The contract will be a firm-fixed price contract; the majority of risk in performing this contract will be placed on the awardee.  It is the responsibility of the vendor/contractor to propose how they will meet the objectives of the Fleet Management Division as detailed in the Statement of Work.<br />&bull;	Individual vendors are encouraged to propose partnering/teaming arrangements with other vendors.  For example, if a contractor does not have the capability to conduct maintenance and service on some of NIH's specialty vehicles, that contractor should arrange with and propose a subcontractor who is able to conduct such maintenance and service.</p>
<p>1.	On the solicitation there is a checklist #8, this is not included in the attachment list of checklist items?</p>
<p>Answer: Please disregard Checklist #8.  Attached is a modified SF1449 in which "Checklist #8" has been removed from all periods of performance.</p>
<p>2.	Am I to project the cost to each checklist item based on a projection of the average vehicle for a year of service? (For example if the 297 cars should have a checklist item preformed 4x each year, should I budget for 297 x 4 for a projections total?)</p>
<p>Answer: Base your checklist prices on an average mid-size sedan (6-cylinder). There should not be much of a price variance as related to light duty vehicles (vehicles under 8500 GVW) until you get to check list #6. The cost of a tune up can vary a great deal depending on not only engine size but model of vehicle. NIH recognizes that and that is why we are requesting you base your checklist on a mid-size sedan (6-cylinder).  Also, please base the four wheel brake service as an inspection, fluid replacement, and clean and adjust - not as a pad or shoe replacement as these two can have such a wide variance.  Furthermore, checklist #4 should be checklist #5 and checklist #5 should be #4 - switch the content of these two lists.</p>
<p>3.	Definition of major or minor repairs: while it would seem that the labor hour is the same for either major or minor, I am not clear what this is asking?</p>
<p>Answer: We are looking for your hourly labor rate. NIH understands that a minor repair is based on time and that time will be charged against the time as it relates to your hourly rate.</p>
<p>4.	Should I include overhead or staffing costs that are directly related to this solicitation, such as a projection that if awarded, I would need to add staffing.   This could be salary for individuals hired to work on this contract, would I then include a yearly budget for those salaries?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. The solicitors should reflect their costs of supporting this contract into the hourly rate that will be charged the NIH.</p>
<p>5.	It is not possible to give a price list of all parts/components that are make/model specific in pricing from our vendors. Do I project the average cost of such parts for 297 average cars per year?</p>
<p>Answer: What we are looking for here is what a flat-rate, percentage discount you will offer the NIH on parts. NIH has too many different years, makes and models of vehicles to consider a pricing of different parts. On part replacements we will be looking at labor rate and the discount percentage of said parts.</p>
<p>6.	In reviewing the solicitation page, the checklist for each of the years in on this form, how do I fill in a amount to each question.   Are you asking for a projection of how many items will be done per year?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>7.	Do you only need the price per each checklist item?   Am I to fill in the complete term (5) years, or are we to only do current contract and do the extensions as awarded?</p>
<p>Answer: We are looking at one price for each checklist as related to a mid size sedan 6 cylinder.</p>
<p>8.	The checklist item is only to include pricing for checklist items, if additional repair/maintenance is required/recommended, where am I to list these exceptions?</p>
<p>Answer: This will be your hourly rate.</p>
<p>9.	I am not sure of additional price lists for parts as each vehicle could have a wide variety of parts that would be impossible to list or find prices for, what is required?</p>
<p>Answer:  NIH does not expect the contractor to submit a list of prices and parts for all of its makes and models. NIH will be evaluating the flat-rate percentage discount the contractor is offering to NIH for parts and will be incorporating it into our overall evaluation factor of price</p>
<p>10.	Would you like a copy of mechanics ASE certificates, or as stated, if requested?</p>
<p>Answer: If requested.</p>
<p>11.	I am not aware of the FSS current price list or catalog, is something you can provide or advise me where to find the Federal Supply Schedule pricing?</p>
<p>Answer: The General Services Administration (GSA) manages the majority of Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) and are used by the Government as a one method of benchmarking the prices for supplies and services. All GSA FSS can be found at www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov. GSA does not have a FSS that lists a benchmark price for automotive maintenance labor hours or a benchmark price for the majority of general automotive parts.  The FSS that most closely resembles this is schedule 56 "Buildings and Building Materials/Industrial Services and Supplies" and various sub-categories.  For the purposes of this solicitation and the resulting contract, potential vendors should not be overly concerned with FSS as the overwhelming majority of services and parts related to this acquisition are not found on any one specific FSS.  As stated earlier, FSS are only one method used by the Government as a market research tool to determine that prices quoted or proposed are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>12.	The Factory or equivalent question to include discounts on parts, It is asking to provide a list, while all the numerous parts vary, as with the BPA I state that<br />a 5% discount is given on all parts Manufacture Suggested Price to NIH .  Would this be acceptable or how am I to list this unit pricing on infinite items?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, this will be acceptable.</p>
<p>13.	Define third-party replacement parts?</p>
<p>Answer: Contractor's are not required to purchase replacement parts directly from the dealer or manufacturer and, instead, are authorized and encouraged to purchase these parts at a local shop (such as AutoZone or Pep Boys) especially if such purchases will result in savings for the Government.  However, replacing an automotive part on a vehicle designed for "general use" with an automotive part designed for "high performance use" (or similar example) would thereby invalidate the contract.</p>
<p>14.	While there is a labor charge for major or minor repair, this contract does not provide a separate labor rate for Truck rates. Is this something I should add?</p>
<p>Answer: No. We expect truck rates to be within your hourly rates. Again, this would be the same as a minor repair. If it takes longer then it would reflect against your hourly rate.</p>
<p>15.	If checklist items are to be based on the vehicles, I would need a list of current mileage on the vehicles to determine which checklist may apply to these vehicles.</p>
<p>Answer: This cannot be done by vehicle because of the nature of our fleet operation.  Base your proposal on an average mid-size, 6 cylinder sedan.</p>
<p>16.	Would you be able to supply a vehicle list with year, make, model, VIN, and approximate mileage so that I can build an offer based on manufacturer time &amp; mileage specifications?</p>
<p>Answer: The NIH fleet will not be able to base its maintenance &amp; repair checklist on mileage. The NIH vehicles do not put that many miles on vehicles because of the nature of our work, but the vehicles still need the checklist services performed.</p>
<p>17.	Is any work permitted onsite?</p>
<p>Answer:  All service and maintenance in relation to this contract will be performed at the contractor's location</p>
<p>18.	Is any afterhour available?</p>
<p>Answer:  Contractors are allowed to direct their facility employees in accordance with the contractor's labor policy as they see fit so long as they are abiding by the appropriate Federal labor laws.  In accordance with FAR part 22.103-2, "Contractors shall perform all contracts, so far as practicable, without using overtime, particularly as a regular employment practice."  In general, because this is a fixed-price contract, overtime compensation will not be approved or paid for by the Government.  However, the Government recognizes that particular circumstances may require the use of overtime.  Should these circumstances occur, it is the responsibility of the contractor to request overtime in a timely manner.  Furthermore, the contract officer is the only person authorized to allow overtime and any equitable adjustment resulting from such an authorization.</p>
<p>19.	Can we leave a shuttle vehicle on NIH property?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-16.

<SUBJECT>HVAC Alterations and Minor Construction for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's Los Angeles Regional Offices Various Floors and Locations within the Building
<SOLNBR>SECHQ1-09-B-0158
<RESPDATE>050809
<CONTACT>Regina Mumford-Rush, Contract Specialist, Phone 202.551.7463, Email Mumford-RushR@sec.gov - Terry Coley, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-551-8088, Email coleyt@sec.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has a requirement for a licensed General Contractor to perform minor alterations at its SEC Los Angeles Regional Office (LARO) located at 5670 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90036.  This project requires the ability to contract with associated subcontractors to install supplemental air conditioning, and to perform electrical, minor drywall work, and flooring per engineered drawings.  The SEC is issuing the solicitation on April 2, 2009.  A Pre-Bid Conference and Walk through will be held on April 21, 2009, at 10 a.m. Pacific Time at 5670 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90036.  SEC will conduct the bid opening on May 8, 2009.  Bidders must call Regina Mumford-Rush to be added to the bidder's list.  Award will be approximately one week after the bid opening; and, the Notice to Proceed will be issued within 10 days of Contract award.  

The SEC LARO is currently experiencing problems related to air conditioning for its data closet rooms on the 7th, 8th, 10th, and 11th floors.  Currently, the existing air conditioning (AC) systems are ducted to the buildings plenum air, causing the room to overheat during off hours and weekends when the building air is turned off. The existing ceiling mounted AC units must be replaced with new ceiling mounted water cooled AC units capable of meeting the heat load demands of the information technology (IT) equipment. The new AC units must be connected to the building condenser water via an in-line pump.  The operation of the data servers and voice switch equipment is critical to the SECs mission.  Additionally, the SEC has a need for a Contractor to perform electrical and minor construction in anticipation of replacing the existing IT equipment.  The Contractor shall perform the following alterations for the SEC LARO per the engineered specified drawings which will be included in the solicitation without charge:  Install new ceiling mounted water-cooled air conditioning units and associated ductwork on the 10th and 11th floors; Install condenser water piping, valves and in-line pump to connect the AC unit to the building existing condenser water riser; Install Emergency Power Off (EPO) electrical switches in the data rooms on 7th, 8th, 10th and 11th floors; Remove carpet and install vinyl composite tile (VCT) in the10th floor data room; Provide electrical work necessary to support SEC's effort to replace existing racks/ equipment in data room on 11th floor.  Unless otherwise approved by the SEC POC, all alteration work shall be performed after normal working hours (Monday-Friday 6:00 PM through 7:00 AM), during holidays or on weekends. The Contractor shall operate in a manner that does not disrupt any of the operational needs of the facility.

<DESC><p><strong>INDUSTRY DAY (Networking Session) ANNOUNCEMENT</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an Industry Day for prospective subcontractors and suppliers to meet with the prime contractor, BE&amp;K Building Group, LLC, in anticipation of award of Construction Phase Services for the new Federal Building and Courthouse, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>The Industry Day will be conducted from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. CDT. on April 22, 2009, in the  Alvin P. DuPont Municipal Court Facility in Courtroom A located at 2122 Sixth Street, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401.</strong></p>
<p>Admission is free. Please bring copies of any brochures, business cards, or other capability statements you may wish to distribute. You are responsible for providing a sufficient number of copies as there are no copying services available. You are also responsible for bringing any required identification to access the secured building.</p>
<p>The new U.S. Federal Building and Courthouse will be constructed in downtown Tuscaloosa and will consist of approximately 11,524 gsm, including underground parking.  Upon completion, the new Federal Building and Courthouse will provide space for multiple agencies including United States District Court, United States Bankruptcy Court, United States Marshals Service, United States Probation Service, Social Security Administration Offices,  Federal Bureau of Investigation, and United States General Services Administration.  The Estimated Construction Cost (ECC) is between $40 and $50 million.</p>
<p>Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue with the prime contractor to foster business relationships.  Prospective small business subcontractors and other subcontractors and suppliers will be given an opportunity to network with the prime contractor to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors/consultants/suppliers.</p>
<p>BE&amp;K Building Group Inc. will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan prior to contract award demonstrating a commitment to awarding subcontracting opportunities for Small Businesses within the following categories: Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including 8(a)), Small Women-Owned Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran and Hub Zone.</p>
<p>Because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between primes and subcontractors/consultants, any agreements or contracts that may develop between potential primes and subcontractors/consultants/suppliers as a result of the Industry Day session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.</p>
<p>Attendance at any Industry Day session is not required and is not mandatory. Questions about Industry Day may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA's Small Business Advocate, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail: DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV  or Valerie Riecke Smith, valerie.riecke@gsa.gov.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.</p>

<p>TITLE: Multi-INT Association &amp; Reasoning Algorithm <br />FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 07-03-IFKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 should be submitted by 8 Dec 2006; FY 08 by 31 Aug 2007; FY 09 by 31 Aug 2008; FY 10 by 31 Aug 2009; and FY 11 by 31 Aug 2010. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 2011, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is a world recognized leader in the development of moving target tracking and Multiple Source Intelligence (Multi-INT) fusion algorithms.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI has established an in-house Fusion Laboratory for the testing, evaluation and development of Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms. The state-of-the-art laboratory hosts an array of current up-to-date sensor simulations and a large repository of collected real world intelligence data available for use in algorithm development and evaluation. In the past the laboratory has been used in the evaluation of a number of contractor and government developed tracking and fusion algorithms. Algorithms are evaluated using a set of metrics developed by AFRL and their contractor partners. This set of metrics has become the community standard for testing of tracking and fusion algorithms. The laboratory is also used for the analysis of operational data to identify recurring patterns that can be used in the exploitation of intelligence data.</p>
<p>Through the evaluation of current state-of-the-art Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms, AFRL/RI has determined that new methods of data association must be developed to meet the tracking and fusion requirements of the operational community. Lack of persistent surveillance, large collection gap times, and dense target environments (&gt;3 targets per sensor resolution cell) result in ambiguous association conditions in Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms. AFRL/RI believes that augmenting traditional Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms with knowledge and reasoning based association algorithms in difficult tracking environments shows promise to increase the tracking performance in difficult situations. Technologies the laboratory is interested in developing and evaluating for this problem include knowledge based reasoning and learning, abductive and deductive reasoning, context based association and other heuristic techniques.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective of this effort is to investigate and evaluate multiple reasoning, knowledge based, and heuristic algorithms against the temporal and spatial association challenges. Work will include implementation and testing of complete systems, encompassing underlying technologies such as knowledge representation and learning techniques required to provide robust performance. Data used to perform reasoning and context based association is Multi-INT in nature.</p>
<p>Research conducted under this program will include application/investigation of knowledge based, reasoning and other heuristic approaches for association.

All white papers shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch and limited to a maximum of 10 pages in length. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Cost of Task, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax and email) (this section is NOT included in the page count); Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.</p>
<p>3.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, in which Criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than criteria (1) through (3), will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the innovative approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology, domain knowledge and the ability to conduct research investigations, (3) Openness of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a top secret and/or secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to top secret and/or secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>Sheila Rakowski<br />Telephone: (315) 330-7069<br />Email: Sheila.Rakowski@rl.af.mil</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements.

This rack must employ weapons and stores cleared to the current envelope of the F/A-18E/F series aircraft.  This rack is also intended for employment of future weapons such as Joint Air to Ground Missile and Small Diameter Bomb and for integration on the Jonit Strike Fighter and other objective platforms.  A complete list of threshold and objective stores and platforms is contained in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) as Attachment (1) to the RFP.  

A major objective of this EMD effort is to minimize flight-testing and re-certification of the threshold stores on the threshold aircraft by requiring the MPBR conform to the Outer Mold Line of the BRU-33 bomb rack, with the addition of store umbilicals and supporting hardware. Offerors who have the skills, experience, qualifications and knowledge required to successfully develop and provide an MPBR will be required to submit a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer analysis of the Offerors design concept. Specific details for the CFD will be contained with in the RFP.

This competition will be conducted using the BEST VALUE Source Selection approach to select the most advantageous offer based on both non-cost factors as well as cost factors.  The Government anticipates evaluating the offers based on technical, cost and past performance.  The Government anticipates this solicitation to result in a single award of a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) contract.

The solicitation is anticipated to be released on or about 30 April 2009 via posting to the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Wayne State University (WSU), 656 West Kirby, 4001 Faculty Administration Building, Detroit, MI 48202-3622. WSU is the only known qualified source to perform this effort. US Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) desires to procure Low Temperature Research services in the study of diesel engine performance under extreme cold ambient conditions. The detailed efforts required include but are not limited to (1) piston skirt and ring structural deformation; (2) split injection of JP-8 and alternate fuels such as synthetic JP-8; (3) four color optical studies on temporal distribution of gas phase temperature, wall temperature, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and carbon in an optical, single cylinder diesel engine; and (4) studies on pilot and/or early injection fuel chemistry utilizing experimental data and CHEMKIN routines to determine dominant reaction pathways for cold start ignition. Market research indicated that WSU is uniquely capable and facilitized to meet TARDEC's research requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. Projected period of performance is eighteen (18) months. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

These roles require supplemental contract staff for normal management and quality control roles during construction, and also for preconstruction roles to allow the project design and pre-construction activities to achieve full scope, schedule, budget, quality and document control integration among various government and contractor team members. Construction management services may also be required at military installations throughout the Savannah District. These military installations can include Ft Bragg, Ft Gordon, Ft Jackson, Ft Stewart, Ft Benning, Ft McPherson, Ft. Gillem, Moody AFB, Hunter AAF, Seymour Johnson AFB, Robins AFB, and other installations as required. Required services include a broad range of engineering and construction activities with an emphasis on DOE nuclear experience, including (but not limited to) earned value management system (EVMS) implementation and analysis; cost and schedule development, manipulation and analysis; nuclear quality assurance (ASME NQA-1); project controls; nuclear glove-box engineering and analysis; EVMS/Cost/Schedule software and information technology configuration implementation, assistance and guidance to field offices; construction and factory/vendor Nuclear QA inspection and reporting; review of contract documents and shop drawings; review of NAS schedules and QC plans; construction management planning and placement planning; development of procurement work packages from designed engineering data; coordination of subcontractor work activities; development and management of a safety program for a large-scale nuclear processing project; and investigation and reporting of construction contractor claims. The services described above will also include those broad range of services required to support engineering and construction activity/management typically found in military construction programs. The firm selected will be required to provide personnel to perform required services. Personnel required for the DOE project at SRS will require U.S citizenship, and may require security clearances up to the DOD equivalent of Top Secret.</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below. Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory, based on the risk to the government that the offeror will successfully perform the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Award will be made to the firm determined to be most highly qualified. Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: Significantly More Important - means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor. More Important - means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater. Equal - means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. For this solicitation, Factor 1 (Specialized Experience and Technical Competence), and Factor 2 (Construction Management Placement Plan/Capacity) are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Factor 3 (Professional Qualifications), Factor 4 (Past Performance), Factor 5 (Knowledge of Locality), and Factor 6 (Geographic Proximity) and significantly more important than Factor 7 (Small Business Participation) and Factor 8 (Volume of Work). Professional Qualifications, Past Performance, Knowledge of Locality, and Geographic Proximity are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Small Business Participation and Volume of DoD Contract Awards. Small Business Participation and Volume of DoD Contract Awards are weighted equally and will only be used as "tie-breakers" among firms that are essentially technically equal. Information on each factor should be submitted FOR THE OFFICE AND/OR EMPLOYEE PERFORMING THE WORK IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. It is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. If more than one office is represented, this must be stated clearly in the work management plan and the Selection Board will consider the performance risk associated with that team not being co-located and the geographical proximity to the supported projects<br />**** FACTOR 1 - SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Specialized experience and technical competence in hiring, managing, and supervising personnel (in descending order of importance within this category): a.

The Government will support the proposed actions by written justification and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  The Government will synopsize the contract modification after award.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC><p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a solicitation within the next thirty (30) days for a Care Coalition Recovery Program to improve the Special Operations Wounded Warrior recovery outcome by early introduction of casualty mentors and providing awareness regarding motivating activities available that boost their confidence and self esteem to better compete for wounded warrior friendly employment opportunities developed through community outreach and employment network development.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: A solicitation 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is being considered by the Government. However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance of the program would begin upon contract award in the forth quarter of FY 2009 and run for a twelve month period. It is envisioned that a contract would be established at time of initial award allowing four (4) additional option periods in the contract. The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all options would be from time of contract award through five (5) years.<br /><br />Any resulting solicitation will call for a Contractor to design, develop, and implement a Warrior Wellness Program addressing the following:</p>
<p>Mentorship Program: Develop confidence in hospitalized, but stable casualties and their families by increasing recuperation process awareness and hope in the future through long-term positive relationships with mentors of similar injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness: Increase the wounded warrior's, families', and hospital staff's awareness of existing quality of life programs through distribution of information and by collaborating with medical treatment facility therapy centers.</p>
<p>Community Outreach: Educate community leaders, businesses, and civic organizations where casualties transition on specific interests and needs of returning wounded warriors to establish a solid foundation for casualty's reintegration into the community.</p>
<p>Resource Networks: Develop a community resource network to capitalize on the success of the mentorship, wellness, and community outreach programs. The Contractor shall also provide access to employment opportunities and community resources further enhancing the special operations wounded warrior's recovery outcome.</p>
<p>Operational Health Advanced Training Program: Provide a program to improve the physical and mental abilities of the wounded warriors returning to active duty with personalized military/tactical performance training in order to give them additional tools to succeed within the military environment.</p>
<p>Advocacy: Educate wounded warriors on available benefits/resources, and interact with Government agencies on their behalf in order to optimize their benefits.</p>
<p>The overall performance objectives include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Severely injured casualties and families verbalize a greater understanding of the recovery "way-ahead" and demonstrate improved recovery rate due to mentor support.</p>
<p>b. Greater casualty involvement in outside activities that have been facilitated through Warrior Wellness Program.</p>
<p>c. A recognized decrease in unemployment rate of casualties leaving military service.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the ability to provide support identified at various locations within the United States as directed by the Government. However, it is anticipated that the primary place of performance will be at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C. The secondary place of performance is anticipated to be Brooke Army Medical Center located at Fort Sam Houston, TX.</p>
<p>Potential sources must possess an active Facility Clearance (FCL) or be eligible to obtain an FCL at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. <br />Questions concerning this pre-solicitation announcement may be directed to Contracting Officer Dr Joseph R Daum, email daumj@socom.mil phone 813-282-8795 ext.6110.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide Government responses to all questions submitted by interested parties to date.

1. How will the rope be deployed?  I could not find any discussion about rope deployment.
The rope will be deployed to the rear of the vehicle with the winch in free-spool operation as described in SAE J706 paragraph 3.1. 2. Is the 42,500 lb. pull based on a bare drum or on the top layer of rope?
The 42,500 lb. pull is based on a bare drum.
3.  Were the specification based on a prototype APU/Winch Configuration previously fabricated and tested by the JPO MRAP?  If so, who provided the prototype?
Yes, it was based on the users' requirement specified in the MRAP Capabilities Production Document (CPD) and also market research conducted by the MRAP JPO staff.  This market research included a test of several COTS APU systems.  At this time, information WRT the market research results is not releasable outside of the Government.
4.  Para 3.2.2.10 Enclosure states "The APU Subsystem shall be ballistically tolerant to withstand 7.62mm direct fire threats."      a.  Question:  Please define ballistically tolerant.      b.  What type of 7.62mm ammunition must we protect against and at what angle and at what distance?     c.    Is protection required for all sides or for specific areas for the APU and Winch?

<SUBJECT>84--Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) DRAFT Purchase Description
<SOLNBR>M6785409R3025
<CONTACT>LisandraT orres E-mail Only
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide interested potential offerors a copy of the DRAFT Purchase Description for the Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) in advance of release of the solicitation.  This is a DRAFT of the Purchase Description only.  The FINAL version of this Purchase Description, along with evaluation factors, instructions to offerors, submittal requirements, and complete terms and conditions of the procurement will be specified in the upcoming solicitation.
The following is a restatement of information included in the previously posted presolicitation notice with minor revisions.  MARCORSYSCOM and PEO Soldier are interested in investigating an Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH), capable of meeting all current combat helmet requirements (i.e., USMC Lightweight Helmet and US Army Advanced Combat Helmet), but exhibiting significantly improved ballistic performance against fragmentation (minimum 35% increase compared to current minimums), handgun and small arms threats. The specified geometry of the helmets procured for both the Marine Corps' and Army's requirements will be tactical (MICH/ACH) cut.  Suspension/retention systems for all helmets  will be from approved mandatory sources of supply.  Interested offerors will be limited to two material solutions (maximum of two (2) proposals each) for the ECH based on the current state-of-the-art materials.  
Interested potential offerors must be able to demonstrate the capability to produce an ECH with the minimum V50 data and not exceeding the maximum weights at the time of proposal submission.  Two or more product demonstration models (consisting of a complete helmet with the currently approved mandatory source of supply suspension/retention systems) will be required as part of the proposal submittal.  These product demonstration models will be required with two (2) types of retention systems:  the X back retention system and the H back retention system.  Specific quantities and requirements for each will be provided in the forthcoming solicitation.  Complete requirements for the written proposal(s) will be set forth in the solicitation, but it is anticipated they will include the following among others: material composition and lay-up, description of basic manufacturing processes, shell weights and thicknesses, rapid production capabilities and delivery schedule, and ballisti! c performance.  Ballistic test data required will include V50s for the 2-, 4-, 16-, and 64-grain Right Circular Cylinder (RCC) and the 17 grain Fragment Simulating Projectile (FSP) generated on actual helmets (i.e. the product demonstration models being proposed and not flat panels) from an NIJ-approved test lab. 
Interested potential offerors are advised that this is a HIGH-PRIORITY joint effort between the Marine Corps and the Army.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to investigate every possibility available to them to expedite delivery of any and all items procured under this effort, both initial test items and any subsequent production items.  Initial items for testing will be due no later than 30 days after contract award, but faster delivery is desired.  Specific requirements will be provided in the forthcoming solicitation.
Interested potential offerors are encouraged to submit comments and/or questions regarding this DRAFT Purchase Decription.  ALL comments and/or questions shall be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer at lisandra.torres@usmc.mil no later than 10:00 am EST, Wednesday 8 April 2009.  No phone calls will be accepted.
