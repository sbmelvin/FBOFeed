<DESC>Note: For the purposes of this RFI, "development system" is defined as an effort which results in a demonstrated capability as outlined in the draft Statement of Objective (SOO).  The effort may or may not leverage existing technology and will be at the potential contractors' discretion.  The Government does not anticipate a traditional large- scale research and development effort will be necessary to demonstrate the needed capability.
This RFI, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), is intended to identify potential sources for a Control & Reporting Center (CRC) Ground Battle Management Command & Control (BMC2) development system  in support of Global Hawk Block 40 Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E). The CRC Ground BMC2 development system will be capable of receiving, processing, and displaying Global Hawk Block 40 MP-RTIP sensor data, in addition to other intelligence data and  tactical information.  Initial market research reveals there are existing products that may be leveraged to substantially meet required capabilities such as: ground tracking; ground situational awareness utilizing GMTI, SAR, Electronic Protection (EP), multi-INT data and Link 16 messages; history playback; and area sentinel monitoring.  Besides these core capabilities, the system must support a visual collaborative environment between geographically dispersed users utilizing the CRC'! s organic networks and communication systems. Visual collaboration is expected to facilitate virtual operator coordination on ground tracks, sensor tasking, and target identification.  The development system will leverage the CRC's Link 16 track management capability to transmit locally generated tracks over Link 16 in accordance with MIL-STD-6016D. 
The Government anticipates but is not obliged to release a solicitation for the above effort in FY2009.  A system development (see definition, next paragraph) effort of approximately 10 months is anticipated, but a longer schedule may be tolerated.  In order to be considered for this effort, a potential contractor must have familiarity with ground target tracking, situation awareness displays, visual collaboration techniques and MIL-STD-6016D Link-16 message processing. The objective of this RFI is to identify any interested and qualified sources capable of satisfying the draft Statement of Objective (SOO) and draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD) requirements provided.  Interested parties who meet the above criteria should describe their up-to-date products, services, experience, and technical capability relevant to successfully accomplishing this effort.  Additionally, though not obligated, the Government  requests  a rough order of magnitude estimate of contracted costs to satisfy the SOO and TRD requirements, along with a top level schedule and staffing profile for system development and support to GH Blk 40 DT&E and IOT&E.  Comments regarding  any of the documents in the RFI package are welcomed.  Although not required, please limit your response to 10 pages single space minimum of 12 point font. 
Please supply this information either by FAX, mail, or e-mail not later than 20 Apr 2009 to Capt. Andrew Geisel, Contracts Manager, 781-377-4755, FAX # 781-377-4924, Andrew.Geisel@hanscom.af.mil, building 1630, 75 Vandenberg Drive, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731  Please indicate if you are US or foreign-owned and if you are a large or small business.  The Government will evaluate all responses objectively however a determination not to compete this effort, based upon responses received, will remain the sole discretion of the Government.
PLEASE REFER TO THE CONTENTS OVERVIEW FILE BEFORE READING ANY OTHER ATTACHMENTS.
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF CONTRACTUAL SOLICITATION.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION THAT IS SUBMITTED.

<DESC><p>The 61st Contracting Squadron, Los Angeles AFB, CA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of a design and build for 3 turnstile gate with controlled access at Fort Macarthur, San Pedro, California and Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, California. The Government is soliciting for the award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 238990. The size standard for NAICS 238990 is $14 million. The government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business) anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.<br /><br />This project consists of a design and build for 3 turnstile gate with controlled access. Currently at Fort MacArthur, the 30th Street entrance there are no provisions to allow pedestrian traffic through the fenceline if the gate is closed. Also the current gate along the east fence at Fort MacArthur cannot be opened without a key or have a security representative manning the gate. These two gate will provide controlled access through the fence by the use of a turnstile. At Los Angeles Air Force Base, the configuration of the pathways to the north of the Douglas Gate Guardhouse, Building 261, requires the two guards to operate during normal business hours. This gate will provide controlled access just north Building 261 by the use of a tandem turnstile and handicap access gate. The existing south turnstile (Aerospace) at El Segundo near the south-east corner of the base is currently controlled through the Aerospace access control system. This gate will utilize the existing turnstile and power at that location and provide new access controls through the LA AFB access control system. The Performance Period for this project is estimated to be one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed. The magnitude of this project is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000.
<p>The evaluation technique to be utilized for the contemplated award of the issued solicitation is Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT). Under PPT, past performance will be evaluated. The Government anticipates the issuance of the Request for Proposal in April 2009 and anticipates a closing in May 2009. The target award date is June 2009.</p>
<p>Interested parties should register online and subscribe to receive procurement announcements related to this solicitation by entering the website at http://www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for release of the solicitation package. To be eligible for contract award, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. Contractors must also submit their representations and certifications at the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) website at https://orca.bpn.gov. There will be no paper copies of this solicitation available. The RFP will be released using the Electronic Posting System (EPS) available at http://www.fbo.gov. All solicitation information may be obtained through the above referenced website. The Government will not reimburse any interested parties for monies spent to provide a response to the subsequent solicitation notice. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation at any time.

Data must be entered into the CMRA Application at any time during the contracts period of performance (POP).  Data must be accurate and complete, and entered into the CMRA by Government Fiscal Year (FY), 1 October through 30 September, for each FY that falls within the POP.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, has a need for project management and engineering support services to enable accomplishment of research projects jointly conducted by Reclamation and other private/public parties. These research projects advance the development of water treatment technologies and speed their adoption and use by the public, helping accomplish Reclamation's mission to develop and sustainably provide water supplies.
Typical projects involve utilizing portable and installed water treatment equipment to test novel, unique, or prototype technologies or processes. Projects can vary in terms of types of water treated, types of treatment skids utilized (membrane types, sizes, recoveries; sand filtration, membrane filtration, etc.), types of processes attempted, types of observation/evaluative instruments, and types of control systems used. Overall, the contractor shall provide test management/engineering services for specific research projects to ensure the successful, day-to-day operations of a project.  Work involves close coordination with the Government, project partner(s), and the WQIC/YDP operations and maintenance contractor staff, which will require the contractor to be on-site for several hours per week. The minimum number of hours the contractor shall be on-site will vary depending on the nature of the project; but typically will not be less than 4 hours per week.  The contractor may be working on multiple projects concurrently, so staffing levels should be sufficient to support multiple projects.

The sampling system based on partial dilution of the exhaust is needed to allow for cooling exhaust, preventing condensation, and simulating processes related to release of exhaust gases and particulates in the environment. The system would allow for measuring concentrations and size distributions of aerosols using instrumentation such as Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer, Fast Mobility Particle Sizer, Electrical Low Pressure Impactor, and Nanoparticle Surface Area Monitor. The same system would be used to obtain filter samples for chemical and toxicological analysis. Since the system will be used for research purposes it should have enough flexibility to allow for control of various dilution parameters and allow for simulation of the environment conditions typically observed in underground mines. One of the objectives of the aforementioned projects is investigation on the effects of various parameters on the properties of diesel aerosols in the occupational environment.
<p>The system should meet the following minimum requirements:<br />1. The system should supply at least 50 lpm of diluted sampling flow rate;<br />2. The dilution ratio should be between 1 :20-1:200;<br />3. 'The primary and secondary dilution ratios and dilution temperatures should be<br />adjustable;<br />4. The dilution air should be filtered and temperature controlled;<br />5. The system should be fully automated and software controlled;<br />6. The information on dilution ratio should be acquired and calculated iin real time;<br />7. The system should be mounted in the mobile rack to allow for easy transfer<br />around the laboratory.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to GLORIA GRUBER, Purchasing Agent, Phone Number 412-386-4967, Fax 412-386-6843, E-Mail ggruber@cdc.gov, Reference Number 00HCCMBC-2009-67778, CDC/NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road Pittsburgh, PA 15236-0070, 15236-0070</p>
<p>All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of electric distribution system for the Utah Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at the Salt Lake City International Airport, to Rocky Mountain Power.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Rocky Mountain Power (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows: The Utah Air National Base (UTANGB) lies within the boundary of the Salt Lake City International Airport (SLCIAP) along a portion of the eastern segment of the SLCIAP.  The airport is owned by the city and base property is leased.  The UTANGB is home to the 151st Air Refueling Wing and occupies approximately 135 acres of the SLCIAPs five square miles of land.  The base has a total 65 buildings: 3 services, 14 administrative, and 48 industrial buildings, amounting to approximately 500,000 square feet.  There are approximately 460 full-time personnel and 1,460 personnel during the once a month unit training.  Electrical power for Salt Lake City IAP (ANG) enters the base at a single location underground near the south gate.  The nominal system voltage is 12470Y/7200 volts.  There are approximately 14,900 linear feet of circuits that are 100% underground and in duct banks.  Configuration is primarily delta connected with some wye connected on the secondary feeds.  Electric power is distributed by an underground branch system that can be controlled by 10 pad mounted sectionalized switches.  There are 7 pad mounted single phase 50 kVA transformers, 19 three phase transformers ranging from 75 to 1000 kVA and 35 electric meters.  The ductbanks are buried at an average depth of three feet with warning tape buried approximately 12 inches below surface grade.  There are no substations or unique components associated with this system.  Base personnel indicate the system capacity is adequate to meet current and future demands.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and no offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR>Interested sources shall contact Ms. Shelley Schrader, shelley.schrader@ang.af.mil, 801-245-2105.<BR>Place of Performance:  151st ARW, Utah Air National Guard Base, Salt Lake City, Utah<BR>Country:   USA<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), intends to negotiate with Northrop Grumman IT Federal Enterprise Solutions for a five-year continuation of Contract HHSN266200400041C to continue the development and growth of the influenza virus component of the BioHealthBase Bioinformatics Resource Center (http://www.biohealthbase.org).  BioHealthBase is one of eight contracts awarded in 2004 as part of the NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Centers program. The purpose of the contract is to provide database and bioinformatics tools to support the analysis and interpretation of genomics data for a number of human pathogens, including the influenza virus. The continuation of the contract will focus on bioinformatics activities to support exclusively the influenza virus information and it will allow for the expansion of the BioHealthBase resource to integrate a variety of influenza research datatypes (non only genomics) in order to ultimately provide a comprehensive data and analysis resource for influenza researchers.  In the past few years, NIAID has significantly expanded its basic and applied influenza research programs in order to provide the knowledge base necessary for the development of antivirals and vaccines and new and improved diagnostics for both seasonal and pandemic influenza. The NIAID-funded influenza programs and initiatives have generated and continue to generate a large amount, and a wide variety, of scientific data that will be critical for researchers in order to develop effective countermeasures for pandemic influenza and improved countermeasures for seasonal influenza.  Ideally, researchers should be able to access all of this data via an integrated, publicly-accessible database. Therefore, since mid-2006 NIAID has been working intensively to improve and augment the database and informatics services provided by the influenza component of BioHealthBase. NIAID wishes to capitalize on the current bioinformatics capabilities of the Contractor to accomplish the additional data integration effort anticipated. BioHealthBase is required to 1) collect and efficiently update research data for the influenza virus; 2) establish databases that store, integrate, and annotate a large variety of experimental data types from different public and private data sources; 3) develop interfaces to the databases to allow external users to easily query, retrieve, analyze, upload, and download data; 4) develop software tools and algorithms to analyze and curate influenza virus research data. Software developed by BioHealthBase shall be made available to the scientific community with an open source license, with the appropriate tutorials and help documentation. Data generated by BioHealthBase will also be publicly disseminated to the scientific community. Outreach activities to the scientific community, hands-on training and workshops shall be provided. This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties who believe that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim. Please include contact person(s) and phone number(s), and identify the type of business, e.g. educational institution, small business, large for profit, research non-profit, etc. The Government will consider any such information received within 45 days of the publication date of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received within 45 days, the Government shall negotiate and modify the contract listed above. See Government-wide Numbered Note 22. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to solicit proposals for sources to conduct clinical trials to evaluate the role of  angiogenic factors, adipokines, and emerging molecules in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes in women with chronic hypertension or obesity to determine molecular interrelationships between preeclampsia and gestation diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to determine whether change in vaginal flora during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy outcome. 

Women with chronic hypertension or obesity represent high risk populations for preeclampsia and GDM.  Understanding the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and GDM and their interrelationship among high risk populations is critical for devising effective prevention and treatment strategies.  Currently, scant pathophysiologic data are available. Inferences from previous studies have been limited by cross-sectional design.  There have been few prospective studies with longitudinal measurements of important biomarkers, especially among high risk women.

To successfully carry out this study contractors will be expected to work closely with NICHD Investigators, a Data Coordinating Center and other Clinical Centers to finalize the study protocol, a manual of operations, and develop data forms.  The contractor will be required to recruit, track and retain for 3 years at least the minimum number of subjects (estimated to be 24 per year) of each type  pregnant women with chronic hypertension without diabetes and with or without obesity; healthy pregnant women obese women, and healthy pregnant women who are not obese.  Additionally, contractors will be required to collect and process a large number of biological specimens; recruit and train research staff in data collection and ultrasonography; and provide adequate facilities and equipment to support all aspects of the study.

Additional details will appear in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued after this announcement on the FedBizOpps (FBO) website: https://www.fbo.gov/  This announcement is intended to inform interested offerors of a planned RFP, provide important background information, and some key requirements essential to responding to the RFP.  Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this presolicitation announcement. 

It is anticipated a cost reimbursement type contract with one base year and three option years will be awarded as a result of the solicitation.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712.  Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Howard Cyrus, Contracting Officer at hc163b@nih.gov  or addressed to NICHD Office of Acquisitions, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Blvd. Room 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, MD  20892-7510 (if hand carried or sending by delivery service -  6100 Executive Boulevard, Room 7A07, Rockville, MD  20852).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  This is not an RFP and does not commit the Government to award a contract.  The reference number to be used on all correspondence concerning this announcement is: NIH-NICHD-DESPR-09-15.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.  

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to solicit proposals for sources to provide repository services for brain and tissue specimens through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 621991.    It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 1-year base period with 4 (four) 1-year options of performance beginning on or about August 1, 2009.   

The NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank was established to advance the research of developmental disabilities. Human autopsy and surgical tissues are retrieved from all over the United States and also from various International sites, including Canada. Over 300 disorders are represented. They include: diagnosed Downs Syndrome, other chromosomal defects, mitochondrial encephalopathies, phenylketonuria and other aminoacidopathies, maternal phenylketonuria, Rett syndrome, leukodystrophies, lysosomal disorders, unexplained forms of mental retardation, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), dyslexia, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Specific tissues collected include the following: brain, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and serum, peripheral nerves, liver, kidney, pancreas, lungs, spleen, adrenal, skeletal muscles, heart, skin, thyroid, lymph nodes and gonads.

The purpose of this acquisition is to continue to provide a resource designed to receive, store, catalog, preserve, and distribute specimens to qualified investigators. The contract will include Quality Assurance/Quality Control requirements for prospective evaluation of short and long term specimen integrity, viability and function. Data generated will aid in ongoing specimen management, including identification and removal of non-useful specimens as well as possible refinement of specimen cataloging and storage models. NICHD anticipates that thousands of diverse specimens will be collected from premortem by biopsy and postmortem from unaffected fetuses and individuals as well as fetuses and individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. The repository will need to establish mechanisms to convey to the professional and lay public the existence of the repositories and the need to obtain tissues. 

The repository shall be located in facilities with specific space allocated from the purpose of this contract, including back-up electrical supplies for computers and storage resources.  The repository shall provide sufficient freezer capacity to ultimately store and maintain biologic specimens derived from approximately 4000 total human donors by the end of the five-year contract period. This estimate includes the approximate 60,000 current donor specimens from approximately 2500 donors, which will transfer with the award, as well as the projected accumulation and storage of an additional 35,000 donor specimens over the course of contract performance.

The RFP will be available electronically on or about April 3, 2009 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole source contract to Electric Boat Corporation (EB), 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT  06340, for the services required to staff and operate a Nuclear Regional Maintenance Department (NRMD) at SUBASE, New London.  The level-of-effort contract will require project management, engineering and planning, training, inspection and nuclear services to accomplish intermediate-level nuclear submarine maintenance, modernization and repairs in support of operational nuclear submarines including maintaining and modernizing facilities and equipment and providing off-hull support of submarine maintenance.  Work will be performed at the submarine base in New London, CT with occasional efforts at the company's shipyard in Groton, CT.  The dynamics of submarine force operation requires an NRMD capable of meeting workload surges and shifting skill requirements on a daily basis.  This requires an NRMD contractor to be a nuclear qualifi! ed shipyard and to maintain a staff in close proximity to SUBASE, New London capable of rapidly providing the necessary mix of personnel.  Electric Boat Corporation is the only source with a nuclear qualified shipyard staff within the necessary proximity of SUBASE, New London capable of meeting the NRMD requirements.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact EB directly.  (See Note 22).

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with
Mainstar Software Corporation, P.O. Box 4132, Bellevue, Washington, 98009, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a Single Source for the purchase of a perpetual site license and accompanying maintenance support for Catalog Recovery+ Software.  SSA currently owns a perpetual license for CR+ that is installed at national headquarters in Woodlawn, Maryland.  The acquisition of a second license for CR+ is needed for workloads that are being transferred to the new second data center, the Durham Support Center (DSC).  Having a second center will lessen the impact of a disaster recovery event by establishing a second, fully functional, co-processing data center.  Each center will back up the data assets of the other.  Mainstar Software Corporation is the only authorized dealer of this software and services known to the Government. The Government anticipates the award of two year firm-fixed price award.  Interested parties that feel they can provide the required software and maintenance support may respond by submitting their capability statement by email to the POC listed above.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procedure.  THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no response is received by the cutoff date listed with this notice, SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with Mainstar Software Corporation. All questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed above.  Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source cost modification to contract 277-05-0104 to: Development Services Group, Inc., 7315 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 800 East, Bethesda, MD  20814

The purpose of this modification is to provide additional funds for the final year of the contract to produce additional areas of content for the Workplace Resource Centers website: http://workplace.samhsa.gov.  New materials are necessary to meet the demand for the revised Federal Mandatory Guidelines effective May 1, 2010. This will create an influx of new users and the need for developing specific drug-free workplace policies and drug-testing materials to address emerging technologies and science.  The modification also meets the demand for the new content related to alternative testing including oral fluid, sweat, point of collection testing, and hair specimens. 

The contract, awarded off the GSA Schedule, is in its last option year (year 5, option 4).  The contract develops and implements multi-media web-based content in support of Executive Order No. 12564, Public Law 100-71 (Section 503), and Public Law 100-690 (Subtitle D--Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988) addressing the goals of establishing a drug-free workplace for the public/private sectors; and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) matrix, Prevention Framework.  The contractor supports all of the Division of Workplace Program (DWP) with the content for a website (Workplace Resource Center) for all relevant data, knowledge and issues.  There are interagency connections on the site including Office of National Drug Control Policy, Department of Transportation, Department of Labor, National Institute of Drug Abuse, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.  Additionally, the website supports the DWP Drug Testing Advisory Board, DWP grantees, and public/private entities.  The contract is responsible for maintenance, augmentation and updating the content available on the Workplace Website for audiences including:  Certified Laboratories, Drug Testing Advisory Board, Federal Drug-Free Workplaces, small businesses, corporations, unions, and Young Adults in the Workplace grants.  

The services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities received within forty five (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a solicitation within the next thirty (30) days for a Warrior Wellness Program to improve the Special Operations Wounded Warrior recovery outcome by early introduction of casualty mentors and providing awareness regarding motivating activities available that boost their confidence and self esteem to better compete for wounded warrior friendly employment opportunities developed through community outreach and employment network development.
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: A solicitation 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is being considered by the Government. However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance of the program would begin upon contract award in the forth quarter of FY 2009 and run for a five (5) to six (6) month period. It is envisioned that a contract would be established at time of initial award allowing five (5) additional option periods in the contract. Four of the options would run for twelve (12) with the final option period lasting six (6) to seven (7) months. The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all options would be from time of contract award through 5 years.<br /><br />Any resulting solicitation will call for a Contractor to design, develop, and implement a Warrior Wellness Program addressing the following:</p>
<p>Mentorship Program: Develop confidence in hospitalized, but stable casualties and their families by increasing recuperation process awareness and hope in the future through long-term positive relationships with mentors of similar injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness: Increase the wounded warrior's, families', and hospital staff's awareness of existing quality of life programs through distribution of information and by collaborating with medical treatment facility therapy centers.</p>
<p>Community Outreach: Educate community leaders, businesses, and civic organizations where casualties transition on specific interests and needs of returning wounded warriors to establish a solid foundation for casualty's reintegration into the community.</p>
<p>Resource Networks: Develop a community resource network to capitalize on the success of the mentorship, wellness, and community outreach programs. The Contractor shall also provide access to employment opportunities and community resources further enhancing the special operations wounded warrior's recovery outcome.</p>
<p>Operational Health Advanced Training Program: Provide a program to improve the physical and mental abilities of the wounded warriors returning to active duty with personalized military/tactical performance training in order to give them additional tools to succeed within the military environment.</p>
<p>Advocacy: Educate wounded warriors on available benefits/resources, and interact with Government agencies on their behalf in order to optimize their benefits.</p>
<p>The overall performance objectives include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Severely injured casualties and families verbalize a greater understanding of the recovery "way-ahead" and demonstrate improved recovery rate due to mentor support.</p>
<p>b. Greater casualty involvement in outside activities that have been facilitated through Warrior Wellness Program.</p>
<p>c. A recognized decrease in unemployment rate of casualties leaving military service.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the ability to provide support identified at various locations within the United States as directed by the Government. However, it is anticipated that the primary place of performance will be at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C. The secondary place of performance is anticipated to be Brooke Army Medical Center located at Fort Sam Houston, TX.</p>
<p>Potential sources must possess an active Facility Clearance (FCL) or be eligible to obtain an FCL at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.</p>

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Technology Applications Contracting Office (TAKO), intends to award a cost-plus fixed-fee (CPFF) contract for the design, development, and airworthiness qualification of an integrated crashworthy ballistic tolerant ergonomic cockpit crew member seat system for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) Airborne A/MH-6M Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) aircraft.   The new seat system design shall provide crash attenuation capabilities in all three axis, an integrated occupant restraint system, integrated 7.62mm ballistic protection, lightweight aircraft impacts, must accommodate 5th and 95th percentile occupants wearing full combat gear, and must maximize the endurance of crewmembers by reducing fatigue due to physical discomfort.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for identifying and developing depot level aircraft modifications and installation instructions necessary to accommodate and integrate the seat system kit on the A/MH-6M.   Considerable A/MH-6M modifications are anticipated to include, but not limited to, the station 78.50 primary airframe structural load carrying bulkhead, the existing cockpit crush box system, critical flight control systems, and the aircrafts landing gear system.  The Contractor shall be responsible for generating sufficient airworthiness substantiation documents necessary to support Government issuance of an airworthiness release of the new seat system and associated aircraft modifications.  Integration of the new system and associated aircraft modifications on one (1) Government furnished A/MH-6M aircraft will be required to validate and finalize the proposed installation instructions.   The Contractor shall provide updates, as required, to the existing A/MH-6M maintenance, parts, and commercial overhaul manuals.  The Boeing Company retains the rights to the proprietary data related to the design of the A/MH-6M aircraft, its components, and the MELB conversion kit.  Additionally, the Boeing Company owns the baseline analytical models that may be further refined in support of this effort that include NASTRAN models of the airframe and landing gears, ADAMS model of the landing gear, and KRASH & LS-DYNA models of the airframe and landing gear.   This capability will protect the force from crash loads and airframe vibrations by upgrading the current A/MH-6M airframe, seat system, and restraint system to meet, as a minimum, the Federal Aviation Regulation FAR 27 with an objective of the MIL-STD-1290 crashworthiness requirements.  The contract is intended to be awarded to the Boeing Company, 5000 East McDowell Road, Mesa, Arizona 85215.  The Government intends to award a two (2) year contract, including a base year and one (1) option year, for this purchase on an other than full and open competitive basis.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority FAR.6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  The Government does not posses and cannot furnish the technical data required to develop engineering descriptions, technical data packages, or specifications necessary to permit full and open competition.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

<p>We are conducting research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience needed to meet the requirement to upgrade, design, build and integrate a new capability into an existing dynamometer system for an existing Air Force 16 foot diameter 153,000 lb variable inertia aircraft wheel and brake dynamometer at the Landing Gear Test Facility(LGTF) located at Wright Patterson AFB Dayton Ohio. The LGTF upgrade project will involve overall contract management and systems engineering approach to provide a new aircraft dynamometer capability within 24-30 months of contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for the overall project management and systems engineering integration of hardware procurements, facility modifications and integration to include both hardware and software. The lead contractor will be required to use a multi-disciplined engineering approach involving mechanical, electrical, dynamic-vibration controls, systems and civil engineers to successfully integrate and upgrade the existing system. Note the new aircraft dynamometer capability will allow an expanded test envelope for test and evaluation of aircraft, wheels, brakes, tires and landing gear systems. A synopsis of requirements are listed in the following paragraph: This new system capability will involve the design of new high horse-power (~ 800 hp) DC electric drive motor(s) coupled to variable inertial dynamometer wheel (up to 153,000 lbs) to provide: high torque (24,000 ft-lbs), high acceleration (5 ft/sec/sec), continuous motor operation at low-speed, high-load (&lt;15mph, 50,000lbs vertical) for aircraft wheel, brake, tire and landing gear testing; in addition, a 3-D articulating carriage integrated with the existing dynamometer will be required to provide &plusmn;30 yaw and &plusmn;10 camber to test various aircraft mission simulations. An integrated computer controlled data acquisition system (2 KHz real-time with 16 bit) with precision speed control (&le; 1%) up to 200 mph will also be required. Facility site preparation within the Landing Gear Test Facility located in Area B, building 31 at Wright-Patterson AFB will involve high voltage main power switch (6900 volt 3 phase), step-down transformers, mounting foundation and support platforms (high-torque DC drive motors/controllers/carriage).</p>

<DESC>High Pressure Fire Loop Project at the B&W Pantex Plant

Babcock & Wilcox Technical Services Pantex LLC (B&W Pantex) is seeking companies experienced in the underground installation of high density polyethylene pipe (HDPE) for fire-suppression systems.  Further to the goal of B&W Pantex to utilize small businesses, B&W Pantex will allow small businesses to team with other companies(small business to large business) to perform this project.  B&W Pantex is interested in a company that has a core competency required for the opportunity at hand, a proven track record for performance, a good safety record, and the necessary financial stability to bond this project and perform the work.  Other teaming relations one might consider are:  mentor protg and small business to small business.

BACKGROUND:
Babcock & Wilcox Technical Services Pantex LLC (B&W Pantex) is the Operating and Maintenance (O&M) Contractor for the U.S Government Department of Energy (DOE) Pantex Plant located near Amarillo, TX.  

PURPOSE:
This contract will provide construction services for the replacement of the existing cast iron and ductile iron High Pressure Fire Loop (HPFL) underground piping and valves at the Pantex Plant.  The existing pipe is to be replaced with HDPE.  The construction activities are to be planned and executed in such a way to minimize interruption of fire protection services to the various site facilities.
 
SYSTEM DESCRIPTON:
The HPFL is designed to provide non-potable water to various site facility fire suppression (sprinkler) systems.

The current system consists predominantly of ductile and cast iron pipe. Pipe sizes range from 6 inches to 14 inches in diameter. Fire hydrants connected to the system are located throughout the areas served.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to enhance the reliability of the HPFL. The current system comprised of ductile iron and cast iron piping is aged and prone to corrosion-induced failures.  The facilities rely on the HPFL to provide fire protection water in accordance with the Pantex plant site Technical Safety Requirements.  The Contractor shall furnish equipment, material procurements, construction services, start-up testing, plant personnel training, and completion of project closeout documentation (such as submittal of as-built drawing mark-ups and NQA-1 project documents) for the HPFL project.

SCHEDULE

ESTIMATED COST RANGE
The total cost of this project is estimated to be more than $10,000,000.00

<SUBJECT>Study to Examine the Feasibility of Using Reading Achievement Levels Developed in 1992 for Reporting Results of the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress in Reading for Grades 4 and 8
<SOLNBR>EDNAGB-09-000040
<RESPDATE>033109
<CONTACT>Stephen E. Swearingen, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-357-0392, Fax 202-357-6945, Email stephen.swearingen@ed.gov
<DESC><p>The National Assessment Governing Board is preparing to design and implement a study to examine the feasibility of using reading achievement levels developed in 1992 for reporting results of the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in reading for grades 4 and 8.
<p>The Governing Board intends to award a sole source contract to the Educational Testing Service (ETS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions. This solicitation will be awarded in accordance with the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) as only one responsible source can provide the required services.</p>
<p>The data to be used for this study are secure. As the incumbent contractor with the National Center for Education Statistics, ETS is authorized to conduct data analysis for the secure data collected for the reading assessment. The analyses required to compute the scaled data and to compute and locate the cut scores on the score scale are complex. The 2008 field trial data for reading at grades 4 and 8 includes an unusual data collection design for NAEP, called a braided design, which was designed and implemented by ETS to link score scales and maintain trend. ETS developed the methodology for scaling the data, and is therefore uniquely well-qualified and equipped to perform these analyses for the Governing Board study.</p>
<p>The procedure of item anchoring and developing anchor descriptions was developed by ETS, and ETS has implemented these studies many times. A high level of experience and expertise are needed for this work. Many of the tools and procedures to be used in this work were developed by ETS who has extensive experience in their application. No other company is known to have as much experience with this type of work, and none has as much experience with NAEP.</p>
<p>Achievement levels are to be the primary method of reporting NAEP results, and reading NAEP results are to be reported within six months unless new achievement levels are to be set. Thus, there is an urgent need for information now to avoid non-compliance with statues governing NAEP reporting.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file, which states and supports that the Educational Testing Service is the only organization that can provide these services. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Governing Board.</p>
<p>The period of performance is from the date of contract award through August 31, 2009.</p>

Small Business Sources Sought Synopsis

This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding (1)  the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.

NIH is a very dynamic organization responding to the initiatives of the individual researcher, Institute Directors, and Congressional mandates.  Research has an inherent inefficiency and many initiatives are readily abandoned and replaced by other initiatives in a slightly different direction.  These program changes are reflected in increases or decreases in the demand for lab coats.  

The NIH investigates the causes, treatments, and preventive strategies for both common and rare diseases, helping to lead the way toward important medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. More than 83% of the NIHs funding is awarded through almost 50,000 competitive grants and awards to more than 325,000 scientists and research support staff at more than 3,000 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in every state and around the world. About 10% of the NIHs budget supports projects conducted by nearly 6,000 scientists in its own laboratories, most of which are on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  These scientists are spread out in approximately 250 laboratories in 50 buildings on a 300 acre campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Labs are also operated in Poolesville, MD, at The National Naval Hospital, and in several rental buildings in Bethesda, Baltimore, Gaithersburg, and Rockville, Maryland.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) anticipates a requirement for laboratory coat (lab coat) cleaning services. The lab coats of the scientists and their support staff need to be cleaned on a regular basis to assure proper sanitation in the laboratories. The NIH anticipates a requirement for a vendor to develop a plan for cleaning the lab coats that includes a reasonable methodology for the logistics of collecting and assuring that the coats get back to the user. Several Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) were established to meet this need. This method did not address the logistical hurdles encountered by the vendors so the service was inconsistent. NIH realized that a complete system for the cleaning of the lab coats, which included a sound logistical plan, was necessary.

At one time, all lab coats were delivered to a central location on the campus for cleaning.  The lab coats were then picked up by the owner and taken back to the labs. Over the years as NIH grew, a system was developed to deliver the lab coats back to the labs since some were delinquent in picking up their lab coats. That further developed into the lab coats being picked up by a central service, being cleaned and then being delivered back to the labs. This system remained in place for many years until the actual cost of the service was analyzed and was determined to be too expensive; therefore, this service was discontinued.  	
	
The NIH anticipates a need for services to be provided for a base year, with four optional years possible as well. Option years would be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. Quantities of lab coats to be processed may vary greatly, but by historical comparisons may approach 20,000  30,000 cleanings per year. The services would be provided to the main NIH campus in Bethesda, MD. That is: 
		
National Institutes of Health (NIH)
9000 Rockville Pike
Bethesda, Maryland 20892

Innovative approaches to satisfying the anticipated requirement to appropriately
clean both NIH owned, and potentially leased lab coats, would be encouraged if a solicitation were issued. 

If your organization is a small business and has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information:  1)   Organization name, address, email address, web site address, and telephone number.  2)  Size and type of ownership for the organization [i.e., small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) firm, etc.]. 

Business experiences, sizes, types, and socioeconomic designations shall be included with the capability statements.  Capability statements must be received by 1:00 pm (Local Time) on April 9, 2009.  Please send/deliver capability statements to the following address:  National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions  OLAO, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 529-X, Attn:  Kathleen M.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking information from potential sources that can design, develop, manufacture, integrate hardware and software, test and support components for a Next Generation (NG) Advanced Horizon Reference System (AHRS).  Proposed performance parameters for the AHRS are available.  This information will be sent to interested parties upon request.  

The AHRS described in this document is intended to upgrade and/or replace the current Horizon Reference Set (HRS), A/W37A-1, on existing ships and future ship construction for all air capable ships. It is anticipated that the AHRS will be the same form, fit, function and footprint as the current HRS, or as close as practical without affecting the ability to retrofit to existing ships.  The AHRS will provide a horizon reference which is independent of the ships rolling motion. The visual display will be a roll-stabilized, lighted reference bar to be located near the top of the hangar face of USN air capable ships. The display will be in the same plane of vision as viewed by an SH-60B helicopter pilot conducting a normal obstruction clearance scan during landing approach and recovery operation on existing LAMPS MK III ships.  The AHRS will meet or exceed all current HRS performance specifications (MIL PRF 85281C(AS) and will be Night Vision Device (NVD) compatible, solve parts obsolescence issues, and have decreased maintenance, resulting in over-all reduction in life-cycle cost.  In addition, the AHRS will provide for mounting locations for optional Pilot Visual Cues (PVCs) that interface with the Aircraft/Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) system and will direct the pilot over a capture area using port/starboard and forward/aft cues. 
 
The AHRS will be made up of two separate components:

a)  A stabilization indicator assembly composed of a lighted reference bar and a warning light driven by Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology and a bar drive mechanism.
b)  An electronic component assembly containing maintenance/operating controls and indicators (herein referred to as the maintenance control panel).

The AHRS will interface over a network to a control panel being developed for the Advanced Lighting System (ALS), which will be located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  The ALS control panel will have the capability of being configured for different ships to control a variety of systems, including the AHRS.
 

The AHRS will receive ship motion signals from the ships gyro and will be controlled (for power, light intensity, etc.) mainly via the remote control panel located in HCS.  The system shall be software configurable to be able to receive stabilization signals from ships NAVSSI or a synchro format.  The maintenance control panel will be available for testing and maintenance and emergency operation. 

The development effort is anticipated to be conducted through an Integrated Product Team (IPT) consisting of the contractor/AHRS designer and NAWC Lakehurst AHRS team members.  The first phase to be executed is the Development phase.  During the Development phase, contractors will develop program plans, develop and produce the System Development & Demonstration (SDD) hardware and support documentation, and test to prove compliance with specification requirements.  A single contract will be awarded for the SDD phase through a fully integrated, production representative system for Technical and Operational Evaluation. (plus additional subsystems/components required to support environmental and shock qualification of the system components).  The SDD system may initially be tested at the NAWCADLKE Test Site.  The SDD phase will begin in FY 10 for the AHRS.  The Test and Integration phase will include shipboard install and check-out by Navy personnel.  Following a successful test at the land based test site or test facility and shipboard testing, a sole source contract will be awarded for production units.     
      
Representatives of US companies who have subsidiaries in foreign countries expecting to participate will also be considered under foreign national rules.  

Any documentation furnished is upon the condition that it or knowledge of it's possession will not be released to another nation without specific authority from the Department of the Navy of the United States; that it will not be used for other than military purposes; that individual or corporate rights originating in the information, whether patented or not,
will be respected and; that the information will be provided the same degree of security afforded it by the Department of Defense of the United States.  Regardless of any other markings on this document, it may not be declassified or downgraded without the written approval of the originating U.S. agency.

Since the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the drawing package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a companys CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.

Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the drawing package shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought synopsis for market research purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the availability of contractors with the technical level of expertise, administrative and management capability to perform the effort described below.  This capability statement will be used to determine the overall procurement strategy.
Naval Facilities (NAVFAC) Sealift Support Program Office (SSPO) has a potential requirement for the overhaul and refurbishment of Side Connector, Remote Hydraulic Carts and 8ft X 8ft X 20ft ISO 668 containers.  The overhaul and refurbishment will take place at the contractor's facility.  
The Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) Side Connector System consists of two major assemblies:  The INLS Side Connector (SC) and the Remote Hydraulic Cart.  The main purpose of the SC is to provide a means of connecting the INLS Combination Modules (CMs) side-by-side to form a rigid connection.  The connectors mate with female pockets located on the side of each CM when engaged.  The connectors are designed to be capable of operation through Sea State 2 and survive in Sea State 4.
The SC is a two-trapezoidal box structure which houses eight bullets at top and bottom for connection.  These eight bullets work in pairs and are moved inward or outward by hydraulic cylinders with controls at the top of the connector.  Each bullet engages with a female socket that conforms to the shape of the bullet.  Female sockets are installed on the CMs.  The objective is to use four side connectors to hold two CMs together side-to-side.  For each connector, all eight bullets engage the female sockets forming a rigid joint.  The hydraulic power is supplied via flexible quick disconnect hoses that connect to the top of each SC. 
 The Remote Hydraulic Cart provides the means to hydraulically power and electrically monitor the connector operation. The Remote Hydraulic Cart receives 3000 psi hydraulic pressure from a separate hydraulic power unit to a hose connection into the back of the Remote Hydraulic Cart. Electrical power (24 VDC) is provided via a generator located in the crew shelter and cabling into the back of the Remote Hydraulic Cart.
The wheeled Remote Hydraulic Cart houses a mobile multifaster, remote control station, electrical interface box, manifold assembly, gage panel and floodlight. The mobile multifaster is designed to mate with the hydraulic and electrical connections on the connector's fixed multifaster. The remote control station contains the operator controls and indicators for operation of the connector. The remote control station is operated via a hand held tethered remote. The manifold has five solenoid operated valves (one for circulation of fluid and four for supply/return to the connector cylinders). The gauge panel is provided with four pressure gauges, one for each of the side connector lines.
The electrical interface box is mounted on the rear side of the Remote Hydraulic Cart. The box provides connections for the incoming hydraulic and electrical power. Also contained in the box is a programmable relay module that receives inputs from the side connector cylinder sensors and the remote control station, and provides outputs to the solenoid valves and the remote control station status indicators. The electrical interface box also contains a proportional valve controller module that receives inputs from the remote control station operator control, and outputs to the hydraulic proportional valve that is located with the Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU).
The SCs and Remote Hydraulic Cart are shipped and stored in 20-foot long ISO containers.  The containers contain pallets, strapping material and safety chains required to keep the SCs secure while in transit.  The ISO containers can be shipped via commercial means. 
Principle features of the work will include the following: 
Side Connectors:
- Unload eight SCs each weighing 4760 lbs out of the ISO containers.- Electrically, hydraulically, mechanically test SCs.- Repair/Replace items as necessary on SCs.- Brush blast entire assembly then repaint.- Create label plates out of Stainless Steel and affix to SCs.-Update 20 SCs by putting 8 bullets per SC on lathe to meet dimensional requirement.

<DESC>Department of Commerce Regulatory Tracking Software

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research and gain knowledge of potential qualified sources that can provide and customize workflow management or business process software to track the development, review and clearance of federal regulations.  This Sources Sought Notice is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates DOC to award a contract. This Sources Sought Notice contains the currently available information.  DOC requires a regulatory tracking system and technical consulting services to implement the system.

DOCs Office of the General Counsel for Legislation and Regulations is responsible for the coordination and management of compliance by Departmental operating units with Executive Orders governing the regulatory process, the Regulatory Flexibility Act and other administrative and procedural regulatory requirements.  These functions include maintenance of an inventory of Departmental regulations setting forth the status of regulations proposed or being considered for proposal and the status of reviews of existing regulations, and review and/or coordination and management of the review by Departmental operating units of Departmental regulations.

To support these functions, DOC is seeking to acquire workflow management or business process software that could be customized to track the development, review and clearance of regulations generated by both the Department and other federal agencies.  The purpose of the resulting regulatory tracking system is to facilitate electronic information transmission and provide a more efficient regulatory clearance process.  The system must be:

-	Web-based.
-	User-friendly and accessible to approximately 200 users.
-	Capable of generating one 8-digit and one 15-digit tracking number, in specified formats.
-	Capable of forwarding draft regulations to multiple parties for their review and clearance, and tracking the dates when clearance has occurred.
-	Able to generate reports showing where each regulation is within the review and clearance process; the length of time it has been at each stage; and the number of regulations each user is reviewing or has reviewed.

Ideally, the system would also be able to interact with or supply data to ROCIS, the Office of Management and Budgets Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) Combined Information System.

We are seeking firms capable of performing the following tasks:  (1) conduct interviews and perform requirements analysis to understand the Departments business process associated with the review and clearance of Department of Commerce regulations, as well as the review of draft regulations that may be issued by other agencies; (2) customize and configure appropriate COTS to meet these requirements; (3) install the customized software and provide training for up to 200 users; and (4) provide operations and maintenance support for out-years.  This requirement is not for software development; the Government is looking for a COTS product that will require minimal reconfiguration to fulfill the stated need.  The Government estimates that no more than 500 hours will be needed for contractor interviews and configuration of COTS products.

Firms responding to this notice should provide a cost estimate for the first year of a potential five-year contract, to perform at least the first three tasks listed above.  The estimate should provide for no more than Responses should also include:  company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small business. 

DISCLAIMER
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a
solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

<a href="mailto:barry.sayer@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), Health Affairs (HA),  and Force Health Protection and Readiness, Psychological Health Strategic Operations are seeking information and recommendations from vendors with the specialized capability and related experience to develop, disseminate and support: (a) a mental health education program that includes an evidence-based assessment component (depression, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol use/abuse) delivered via both telehealth (i.e., on-line and phone) and in-person (e.g., health fair events) venues, and (b) an evidence-based suicide prevention program in the schools (junior and senior high school) for Service Members and their families.  As such, the program serves the entire military family, from school age onward in a confidential yet resource rich manner.  Other major components of this initiative are described below.<BR><BR>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.<BR><BR>At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future Request for Proposal (RFP), as well as those regarding the nature of the products reviewed for this initiative, will not be entertained.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND <BR><BR>Observances of National Depression Screening Day (NDSD) and National Alcohol Screening Day (NASD) have been conducted throughout the DoD since the inception of these community-based screening events in 1991.  In the past, each individual installation was responsible for procuring materials from the National Depression and Alcohol Screening organization.  The 2006 National Department of Defense Acquisition Act (NDAA 06) issued a requirement for a DoD-wide program.  The DoD centralized program began development in Oct 2005 and was implemented starting in January 2006 to an overwhelming response on the part of military bases and National Guard units.  To date, thousands of in-person screenings for depression and alcohol abuse/dependence have been conducted at military installations across the United States and around the globe, with weekly numbers of online screening and education requests expanding exponentially as military and general media coverage of the program increased.   <BR><BR>As a result of the effectiveness and popularity of the program, the 2007 National Department of Defense Acquisition Act (NDAA 07) continued and expanded this program via Sec 730: The DeWine Amendment.  Additional components to the in-person events, on-line services and telephone-based self-assessment (available 24/7, in English and Spanish), now include customized referral information (for installations electing this program feature) and experienced in-person mental health consultation to selected hot spot installations.  The mental health education component has been developed significantly with the production of a compelling video, A Different Kind of Courage, which incorporates the personal testimony of individual Service Members and military leaders.  An evidence-based Suicide Prevention Program has been implemented in Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools and is being expanded to High Impact Schools (i.e., community schools that include a high proportion of military dependents) to provide important mental health education to children and parents of children who are affected by Service Members deployment.  This program is the only universal school-based suicide prevention program to show a reduction in suicidal behavior in a randomized controlled trial, and a program evaluation is underway to test its effectiveness in DoDEA and High Impact Schools.  New graphics and content have been added to the on-line screening platform, including topical webinars delivered by leading experts in military mental health targeted for the education of the end users and for the continuing education of military health professionals, chaplains and family group leaders.  A special kit of mental health educational resources designed specifically for readiness groups, chaplains and other groups helping family members has been developed and widely disseminated.  Social marketing campaigns in military commissaries with customized products to deliver mental health messages and use of the program have recently been introduced as part of a larger ongoing mental health promotion campaign.   <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION<BR><BR>The provision of a proactive mental health education program is a natural extension of ongoing efforts by the DoD to reach Service Members and their families with mental health information and support services.  The program is designed is to help families and service personnel identify their own individual symptoms and access mental health assistance, ideally before a problem becomes urgent.<BR><BR>The program is defined the high quality mental health consultation and education capabilities,  evidence-based programs and products, and highly skilled technical assistance and customized promotion and outreach services, in addition to: On-line and Telephone Education, Screening and Referral (available 24/7, in English and Spanish); In-Person (Health Fair Events) Education, Screening and Referral (including an adequate number of Spanish-language mental health education kits); Evidence-based Suicide Prevention Program for Adolescents; DVD and other multi-media educational resources.  <BR><BR>In keeping with expanded program utilization and mental health education goals for FY2010, the program will develop as follows: Novel learning opportunities for users through the addition of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and Video Doctor Technology, prompting health education interventions based on feedback from the evidence-based assessments and leading to increased user understanding, greater access to treatment options, and improved patient readiness for treatment.  Treatment referral options will be simplified and demystified with the presentation with stepped-care options (i.e., starting with self-care suggestions and progressing through specialized in-patient care as a final step).  Users will be educated about the nature of various options as needed and linked with resources.<BR>   <BR><BR><BR>Questions/Items:<BR><BR>The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions as well as address their ability to provide the following requirements and suggest any proposed resources and/or materials needed to complete the functions indicated below: <BR><BR>A.  TECHNICAL SOLUTION: <BR><BR>The broad goals of the mental health education program are: (a) to reduce stigma and educate military families and Service Members about mental health and alcohol services provided through the military, and (b) to encourage appropriate help-seeking and treatment of mental health and alcohol problems for military families and Service Members throughout the world, particularly those who have been affected by deployment and mobilization.  The continuity and quality of these services must remain at the highest level of availability, confidentiality and trust to ensure Service Members and their families have this form of mental health education and referral available to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  <BR><BR>Given these broadly stated goals, how can the military most effectively and efficiently provide the following program components?  <BR><BR>1)	Provision of year-round, voluntary, anonymous interactive on-line, telephone and in-person mental health and alcohol screening and referrals customized by location:  Individual screening must use trusted, evaluated population-based assessment instruments and tailored feedback based on individualized assessment and referral recommendations.  In-person events will coincide with National Alcohol and National Depression Screening Days.  All registration, educational kit preparation, installation staff training and consultation will be provided for these days, or days elected by installations.  All content included in the program must be provided in English and Spanish.<BR><BR><BR>2)	Provision of a nationally recognized, evidence-based suicide prevention and education program to Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) and Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS).  The program designed must address the unique mental health needs of military children and their families.<BR><BR>3)	Provision of an interactive, online assessment to help parents to assess the mental health symptoms of their children and to provide parents with guidance for next steps.<BR><BR>4)	Development of interactive streaming video and IVR technology to enhance Service Member and family treatment readiness and to guide follow-up referral process.  The technology must incorporate branching decision-tree logic for clinical interviewing.  <BR>           <BR>5)	Development of on-line workbooks for each screened problem (depression, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol use/abuse) as a self-help alternative in a stepped-care model of treatment.<BR><BR>6)	Development of associated educational information material in diverse formats to support providers and end users, to include workbooks, webinars, and complimentary follow-up video production (using Service Member and military leader testimonials) to support, enhance, and expand previously offered program components and media (i.e.,A Different Kind of Courage, described above).<BR><BR>7)	Development and implementation of a promotional campaign and adjunct materials (including PSAs, flyers, posters, direct mailings, etc.) to ensure Service Members and their families are aware of the Mental Health Education Program world-wide.   <BR><BR>Vendors are requested to provide creative and innovative approaches that could meet the requirements, objectives, and considerations summarized above, taking into consideration that  educational content, business processes, websites, self-assessment systems  etc., currently in use by the military are proprietary and copyrighted by the current vendor and would have to be recreated originally to provide at least the existing level of service.  <BR><BR>To demonstrate the vendors capabilities and experience, the Government requests examples of current or past programs including: (1) anonymous on-line, telephone, and in-person mental health assessment (with population-based instruments); world-wide (in English and Spanish), involving customized referrals; (2) national recognition and experience in creating, registering, promoting and staff training for mental health prevention; (3) evidence-based suicide prevention program development and implementation (in both Junior and Senior High Schools); (4) mental health education materials production and dissemination capabilities world-wide (i.e., video, kit, workbook, webinar, website and production); (5) mental health consultation and teaching capabilities; (6) interactive streaming video and IVR technology development and implementation to enhance healthcare treatment engagement and referral; (7) marketing and promotional campaigns for mental health programs.        <BR><BR>The vendor shall specify their specific role in all programs described (e.g., technical and content development) and their current capability to develop, support and sustain such programs world-wide, continuously, confidentially, and readily accessible on a 24-hour basis.  <BR><BR>B.

<SUBJECT>Land-Based Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) - Market Research
<SOLNBR>HSCG32-09-I-R00014
<RESPDATE>042009
<CONTACT>Helen R Nelson, Phone 860-271-2843, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Research and Development Center (RDC), New London, CT, as a means of market research regarding the state of the land based Unmanned Aerial System (LB UAS) market.  The Coast Guard is seeking information of the non-developmental Technical Readiness Level (TRL 6+) UAS technologies available from government, industry and academia.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or an obligation or intent of the USCG to acquire any products and/or services.  Furthermore, this RFI is independent of a related RFI previously posted on October 28, 2008 (HSCG32-09-I-R00003) by the USCG RDC for UAS to operate off the National Security Cutter (NSC).    

The Coast Guard is contemplating the use of LB UAS to execute Coast Guards missions, including search and rescue, counter drug law enforcement, migrant interdiction, living marine resources (aka fisheries enforcement), and defense readiness.  In concept, the USCG would seek to operate the LB UAS in the offshore environment beyond line of sight of the ground control station (GSC). Consequently, the candidate UASs would be relying on their own sensors to surveil, detect, classify, and identify (SDCI) targets of interest.  Through multiple analyses previously conducted, the RDC has shown that properly configured UASs may offer significant benefit to USCG mission execution.

Notional Operational Profiles

(1) The UAS shall perform surveillance on pre-planned routes to support the detection, classification, identification and tracking of surface targets while providing near real-time data distribution;

(2) The UAS shall loiter over targets of interest while providing near real-time tracking and surveillance data; and

(3) The UAS, when directed from the GCS, shall relocate previously detected targets and perform a classification and identification.

You are invited to respond with information to assist the USCG RDC with its market research to identify potential sources of LB UAS (including platform, payloads, Ground Control Station (GCS), and control and data links).  For purposes of this RFI, LB UAS is a complete turn-key system including: the aerial platform, integrated sensor payloads (i.e. Radar, Electrical Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR), Automatic Identification System, Directional Finder, etc.), and control and data communications capabilities.  The Coast Guard is interested in technology that can be operated and maintained on existing airfields and operated anywhere in the worldwide maritime offshore environment.

Performance Requirements

The below listed performance requirements are of equal importance to the Coast Guard:

(1)  The UAS shall be able to be launched and recovered, operated, maintained, serviced and hangared on existing military airfields;

(2)  The UAS platform shall have a mission applicable payload including sensors and command and control systems suitable for the maritime environment fully integrated into the platform and GCS;

(3)  The UAS integrated payload shall demonstrate proven performance in the maritime environment;

(4)  The UAS sensor payloads shall be capable of detecting, classifying, identifying and tracking targets in the maritime environment; 

(5)  The UAS shall have a Common Data Link (CDL) that complies with the Military Standard (MIL STD)-CDL, the Unmanned Systems Interoperability Profile (USIP) and Standard Agreements (STANAGs) 7085 and 4586;

(6)  The UAS CDL shall be capable of transmitting organic sensor metadata to the controlling station;

(7)  UAS command and control payloads shall be capable of permitting afloat assets to maintain North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement (STANAG) Level 2 control of the sensors and provide for the near real-time transmission of sensor data (radar, EO/IR, etc.);

(8)  The UAS platform shall have a minimum of a 14-hour endurance, 80 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) cruise speed at 25,000 ft (International Standard Atmosphere), and 500 pound payload capability;  
 
(9)  UAS shall demonstrate an effective mission radius greater than 500 nautical miles, which includes the ability of the UAS to transmit real-time or near real-time sensor data; 

(10) The UAS (platform, payloads, and full fuel load) shall be able to be handled, operated and maintained by Coast Guard personnel under all expected operational conditions; and

(11) The UAS platform shall have a maximum service ceiling no lower than 20,000 ft mean sea level (MSL).  

Responding to This Market Survey

(1)  Provide a detailed description of the potential UAS (platform, payloads, GCS, and control links);

(2)  Describe your UASs demonstrated ability to meet the above listed performance requirements (provide test or operational flight results that illustrate how the UAS meets (or exceeds) the above listed performance requirements);

(3)  Describe performance parameters and capabilities the UAS can provide in addition to the above listed performance requirements;

(4)  Populate the data fields on the spreadsheet, Land Based UAS Summary Response Form, Attachment A;

(5)  Briefly describe any U.S. (or international) government contracts for programs of record or products being submitted as applicable.  For government contracts, please provide government points of contact;

(6)  Provide any digital photos and/or digital videos of the products in operation; and

(7)  Identify whether you are a Small or Large Business using NAICS Code 541330.

NOTE:   If your submittal is greater than 50 MB, please provide on DVD media and mail to:

<DESC><p>A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d): The Contracting Officer hereby determines that this action represents the best value to the Government in accordance with FAR 8.404(d) in that ADT exclusively possesses the technical expertise and understanding of Offutt AFB's security requirements to provide and maintain motion/heat devices in accordance with ever-changing requirements. As a result, an award to a new contractor would not be realistic for the following reasons:
<p>i. Removing ADT's equipment and installing new equipment would unacceptably disrupt base security. The Security Forces estimate it would be at least a one-year effort and require an additional 40 personnel working 12 hour shifts, seven days a week to cover the 760 critical areas on Offutt AFB to include over 40 Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF's). Any breach of security would jeopardize the 55th Wing, HQ AFWA, 97 IS and STRATCOM's ability to support their respective missions including the current war effort.</p>
<p>ii. To remove and replace the entire ADT system is expected to cost an estimated $8.3 million based on market research conducted by 55 SFS and 55 CES. This figure does not include an unspecified cost for the added burden of providing manning for physical security during the transition from ADT's system to a new contractor's system. With the increased ops-tempo, deployments within the Security Forces community, and world climate, it would be impossible to accomplish without additional measures. Furthermore, the replacement costs for equipment and transition are extensive, and funds are not currently budgeted to support an effort of this magnitude.</p>
<p>A sources sought synopsis was posted on Fed Biz Ops on 26 Dec 2008 identifying a sampling of common equipment currently utilized. A comparison of the pricing results from the respondents found that ADT was an average of 48% less than all other respondents.</p>
<p>Based on above results, the current contract, ADT's GSA contract (GS-07F-8854D) pricing, and comparison of similar items on other GSA schedules, the price will be determined fair and reasonable.</p>

<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Tape, Pressure Sensitive, Adhesive by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Programmable Power Strips by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-2051, Programmable Power Strip - 15 x 3 x 1 inch power strip that can be programmed to allow peripheral devices on a computer to be powered down or off. Using software loaded in the computer, the power strip monitors all peripheral devices to determine if they are being used and shuts them down if inactive.</p>

The wastewater system being privatized is described as follows: the Nevada Air National Guard Base, 152nd Airlift Wing is located at the Reno/Tahoe International Airport (RTIA) in Reno, Nevada.  The base is located on the southwest side of RTIA on a 60 acre parcel.  The base has 37 buildings; 13 administrative, 23 industrial, and 1 services, amounting to approximately 302,000 square feet.  Day-to-day activities are managed by a force of 250 full-time personnel.  One weekend per month this population swells to more than 1100 members during military training assemblies.  The base has no residential or transient housing facilities.  The RTIA is located four miles southeast of the Reno central business district. The wastewater collection system at the Nevada ANGB is 100% gravity fed and exits the base at four separate locations.  The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 55 linear feet of 6-inch PVC pipe, 4,300 linear feet of concrete asbestos pipe ranging in size from 4 to 18 inches, and 3,200 linear feet of vitrified clay pipe ranging in size from 4 to 12 inches.  Pipe depths range from 3 to 10 feet.  Additionally, there are 11 pre-cast concrete manholes and 6 poured-in-place concrete manholes ranging from 6 to 10 feet in depth. Base personnel indicate the system capacity is adequate to meet current and future demands.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and one offer was received and subsequently withdrawn. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

<DESC><p><br />REQUEST FOR COMMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED USE OF A DETERMINATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES (DEC) FOR THE NINDS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY FOR NEUROTHERAPEUTICS PROGRAM
<p>SUMMARY: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is seeking public comment on a proposed use of a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), as provided for under the Bayh-Dole Act, for its new Medicinal Chemistry for Neurotherapeutics Program (MCNP).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The goal of the NINDS MCNP is to improve public health by stimulating the development of new drugs for neurological diseases. The NINDS has supported high-throughput screens and basic research studies that have led to the discovery of many small molecule compounds with activity in models of neurological disease. Some of these compounds might be transformed into drugs, with chemical modifications to improve their potency and pharmacological properties. However, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are hesitant to invest in the early development of compounds for rare diseases or new targets, given concerns about market success, budgets, and associated risks. Academic researchers who have identified a promising compound rarely have access to medicinal chemistry services. The MCNP is intended to overcome these barriers. The MCNP will provide the resources and chemistry expertise to transform small molecule compounds with evidence of bioactivity into lead compounds of sufficient potency, efficacy, and drug-likeness to begin the preclinical studies required for an investigational new drug application. Once their projects have "graduated" from the MCNP, researchers can take advantage of other NIH resources, such as the NINDS Translational Research Cooperative Program, the NIH Rapid Access to Interventional Development (RAID) Pilot Program, and funding agreements for clinical trials to advance their drug leads through preclinical and clinical testing. Researchers may also engage industry and other non-government resources for follow-up work.</p>
<p>The MCNP is envisioned as a collaborative effort between an NINDS-contracted medicinal chemistry service facility and academic or industry researchers with bioassays that model neurological disorders and bioactive small molecule compounds. Under the MCNP, the researchers (Contributors) will provide their compounds to the NINDS medicinal chemistry service facility (Contractors) as a starting point for chemical optimization. The Contractors will design and generate chemical analogs of these starting compounds, and the Contributors will test the chemical analogs in their disease bioassays. The results will inform the next round of analog design and development, and so on, for potentially dozens of rounds.</p>
<p>The design of new chemical analogs under the MCNP may generate new inventions. The Bayh-Dole Act establishes the rights and obligations of grantees and contractors to Subject Inventions-inventions that are conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement by the Federal Government. One of the goals of the Bayh-Dole Act is to incentivize the commercialization of Government-supported Subject Inventions. Under the Bayh-Dole Act, Government contractors generally retain the right to elect title to inventions made by its researchers as a result of their work performed under a Government-supported agreement. A Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to the Bayh-Dole Act directs ownership of inventions made by the funding recipient to the Government or other party. Thus, without a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances, the NINDS-contracted MCNP medicinal chemists would retain the right to elect title/ownership of inventions to all new compounds that they invent under a funding agreement from NINDS.</p>
<p>Responses to a NINDS-issued Request for Information (RFI) directed at potential Contributors and Contractors suggest that allowing the Contractors to retain ownership to the chemical analog patent rights would actually impede the further development and commercialization of new drugs. In order to develop good lead compounds, the MCNP must attract promising, high quality starting compounds. Potential Contributors informed the NINDS that they would participate in the MCNP only if they could be assured full ownership of patent rights to all analogs generated from their starting compounds. Most potential Contractors did not express interest in retaining ownership of Subject Inventions directed to the analogs and their methods of use. These potential Contractors indicated that their business model for these particular circumstances would be to provide specific services for a fee.</p>
<p>PROPOSED IP STRATEGY: For the MCNP, the NINDS is considering a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), as provided for under the Bayh-Dole Act. The DEC would cover two classes of Subject Inventions:</p>
<p>1) For Subject Inventions directed to analog compounds and their methods of use, the NINDS medicinal chemistry Contractors would be required to offer the first right of assignment to the Contributor. If the Contributor declines offer of assignment, then NINDS may dispose of the invention rights as NINDS determines would be in the best interests of the program and public health (e.g., allow Contractor to retain invention rights).</p>
<p>2) For Subject Inventions directed to the methods of manufacturing the analog compounds, the Contractor would retain all rights, but the DEC may require that the Contractor grant or agree to negotiate licenses so as to enable research use and commercialization of the compounds.</p>
<p>Rights to all other Subject Inventions will be retained by the Contractor pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act.</p>
<p>RESPONSES: The NINDS invites comments on this strategy and use of a DEC for the MCNP. Alternative strategies that will encourage the contribution of chemical compounds to the program will be considered before a final determination is made regarding the use of a DEC.</p>
<p>Please submit your comments to the attention of Annette Carter, Contracting Officer at the address below by 4:00 PM Local Time on April 17, 2009.</p>

<RESPDATE>032409
<CONTACT>John B Bova, Contracts Specialist, Email bovaj@sec.gov
<DESC>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price contract to Rivet Software. Rivet Software was previously under contract with the SEC to develop an XBRL rendering engine to transform raw XBRL documents into a human readable format. The software developed under the previous contract was released on the SECs website in December 2008. The additional work covered by this notice includes modifying the existing Rendering Engine software application to add functionality specifically required to support the new mutual fund taxonomies and to fix defects that occur in the ordinary use of the application. To ensure that these new capabilities are in place in time to support the Commission Rules Release 33-9002 Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting and Release 33-9006 Interactive Data for Mutual Fund Risk/Return Summary, it is essential that Rivet Software perform the additional work.  This allows the SEC to save time and cost by using the contractor that is already knowledgeable on the details of the existing software application uniquely positioned to develop the additional requirements in the most efficient manner. The period of performance shall be one year from the date of award. The SEC intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This is a Notice of Intent, not a solicitation. Information received in response to this Notice will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements. No solicitation will be issued for this sole source requirement and no other information will be provided.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, Tacoma, WA intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) Sole Source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The VA intends to award a contract to Synthes USA Sales for a Small Fragment Locking Compression Plate (LCP) Instrument/Implant Set Ref# 105.34. The instrument set is a proprietary item and standardizes to the existing instrument sets. Substituting another product would entail completely retooling surgical packs and extensive retraining of both Sterile Processing and Nursing Staff. Maintaining standardization of these instrument sets represents best practice, standard of care, and is a patient safety issue. It is the belief of the Government that Synthes is currently the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement. A justification for other than full and open competition is prepared in support of this acquisition. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Applicable NAICS code is 339112. Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by emails addressed to craig.magee@va.gov or by phone at 253.583.2169. Responses will be accepted no later than March 25, 2009, 4:30 PM (EST).

(End of Clause) 
Project Purpose  

The United Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Employee Development Center (NEDC) has a need for a Contractor to develop and provide training for a course on Working Effectively with Livestock Producers (WELP) as outlined on the enclosed Curriculum Plan. The Contractor must demonstrate expert knowledge of the specific circumstances and unique design needs of NRCS personnel as they work to effectively assist livestock producers through improved communication skills related to resource conservation on grazinglands. 

The course as designed and presented should increase the students working knowledge of livestock operations and economic impacts of conservation-related decisions which affect and are affected by the producers decisions and income. The knowledge, skills, and abilities obtained from this course will result in better grazingland applications as facilitated by Farm Bill programs. 

The course instructor shall present a pre and a post test to the attendees to measure the effectiveness of the course. The tests shall be given to the NEDC representative at the end of the course. 

Projected performance period for the initial course is not later than October 30, 2009. It is estimated that the course will have approximately 25-30 attendees. Students will be primarily NRCS employees and partners who have the responsibility of working with livestock operators using grazing resources. The Government reserves the right to cancel this course due to lack of enrollees. If the Government cancels this course and no further courses are ordered during the ordering period of date of award through December 31, 2012, the Government will pay Contractor for the course development. 
The Contractor is responsible for the location of the training. The Contractor shall provide all equipment, supplies, and transportation necessary to deliver the course. It is likely that the university instructors will hold WELP training within or near the university-owned facilities and research stations. However, the Contractor may occasionally have to travel as necessary to develop, pilot, review, hold session, and evaluate the training. The Contractor shall bear the costs of their own travel, meals, and accommodations. 

Proposals: 

Contractors are asked to include the following information with their proposals. 

1) Summary of performance with federal agencies in the past 24 months, include contract number, purchase order number and agency phone number(s). If no past performance with federal agencies in past 24 months, include 3 professional business references. 2) Copy of proposed curriculum, if changes are posed. 
3) Detailed quote. All quotes should be all inclusive for: 1) Course Development, and 2) Per head for actual training course (The Contractor shall figure the per head cost to include the cost of the training plus any overhead costs.) The awardee will only be paid for actual attendees.
4) Description of the location of training. 

PROJECT SCOPE 

The selected Contractor will develop and pilot the WELP training in coordination with the NRCS Subject Matter Experts (SME) and include the performance of the following tasks: 

1. Course length of nine full days (Monday noon first week, to Friday noon  second week). 

2. Review the enclosed WELP Curriculum Plan prior to developing Working Effectively with Livestock Producers course. 

3. Contact the NRCS technical leader for any clarification about course content and intent of the learning units. 

4. Produce classroom agenda, schedules, training materials, and teaching aids in English language to include take-home CD or reference handbooks for each student. 

5. Provide a copy of electronic course materials on CD as well as hardcopy version for use at NEDC NRCS USDA discretion. 

6. Coordinate set up of training location, course logistics, and field visits. 

7. Furnish transportation for students between lodging, classroom, and field sites. 

8. Develop observable and measurable learning objectives. 


9. Develop pretest and posttest that align with learning objectives. 

10. Hold pilot training, evaluate instruction, and write observations. Documentations will be provided to NEDC NRCS USDA representative following the pilot session. 

Course completion reports shall be provided to the NEDC representative (to be named upon award) not later than seven (7) days after course completion. 
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: technical capability of the firm or individual to meet the Government requirement, present/past performance and price. Technical Capability of the firm or the individual combined with present/past performance is of a significant greater value than price. 
The evaluation of qualifying proposals will be carried out by the Contracting Officer and other personnel deemed necessary to complete the evaluation. 
Technical Evaluation: The evaluation of each proposal will assess and measure the ability and knowledge of the Offeror to provide the services described above. In the evaluation of Technical Capability, the evaluator will use the following adjectives and related definitions to define the Technical Capability the proposal poses.

The offerors proposal shall contain a response to each of the areas identified below.  Only those proposals prepared in accordance with the solicitation will be evaluated.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on three factors:


Technical Approach Proposal/Factor 1:  (Most Important)

Price/Factor 2:  (2nd Most Important) The cost proposal shall contain Firm Fixed Prices for 8 Units for the Base and Option Periods as well.  Although price is not the controlling factor in award of a contract under this solicitation; it is an important factor and should not be ignored.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of the equality of the proposals in terms of the other evaluation factors on which selection is based.  If competing proposals are substantially equal in technical and delivery capability, price may be the determining factor in award.

Delivery Capability /Factor 3:  (As Important as Technical Proposal) It is critical that the offeror state that he or she can meet the requirement to be on-site within 24 hours of service/breakdown calls. And to provide the maintenance schedule that they propose.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

The Nucleofector concept uses a unique combination of electrical parameters and cell-type specific Nucleofector solutions. Based on this combination, the Nucleofector Technology is the first efficient routine method for non-viral gene transfer into primary cells and hard-to-transfect cell lines. In addition, the Nucleofector Technology to date is unique in its ability to transfer DNA directly into the cell nucleus. The Nucleofector technology thus enables gene transfer into highly relevant cell types, often with unprecedented efficiencies.




The transfection process is a manual process in most instances with very low efficiency. Some automated processes are offered, but are not designed for high throughput.
The technology that we seek should be able to accommodate our studies in the providing the following:
1.	The ability to transfer biologically active molecules (e.g.DNA, RNA, proteins of varying size) into the cytoplasm and into the nucleus of primary cells and cell lines without significant cell toxicity.
2.	The ability to transfect non-dividing cells, such as neurons and resting blood cells.
3.	High throughput transfection of single and multiple samples. 
4.	The instrument must have a  single cuvette component, a 96-well format component, a laptop, including user friendly software interfaced with the system.
5.	A 96 well independent format, with each well being pulsed and treated as an independent sample, thus giving the capacity to process 96 different conditions across the plate. 
6.	The capacity to transfer non-viral genes into primary cells and cell lines that are hard to transfect.
7.	Transfected cells must be ready for analysis in 2-6hrs.
8.	Machine must be able to provide very high efficiencies. Up to 95% transfection efficiency with DNA combined with viabilities greater than 95% and up to 99% siRNA duplex transfer in suspension cells.
9.	Software interfaced with the system must be user friendly and provide protocols that are cell-type specific.
10.	Reagents and components for use with the system must be cost efficient.

<DESC>This is amendment 2 to the combined synopsis/solicitation entitled Candidate Li-ionCell Designs for the International Space Station Battery, NNJ09282946Q, which was postedon March 05, 2009.  You are notified that the following changes are made: 1. The due date for responses has been extended.  Offers for the items described inNNJ09282946Q are due by 01:30 local time, March 24, 2009.2. Clarify that offers for the items listed in the combined synopis/solicitation must bemailed to Perry Lamar Mueller, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston, TX 77058.  Electronic copieswill not be accepted. 3. Answer the following questions below:Question: Can the charge/discharge cycles be run at an EOCV less than the 126V, forexample we would recommend that in the actual use that an EOCV of 120V be used, is thisacceptable?Answer: Yes. The  76V to 126V is a maximum voltage window. Selecting narrower operatingconditions is acceptable. Question: The maximum charge rate is 73A from the Battery Charge Discharge Unit, is itacceptable to specify a charge current lower than the 73A to maximize battery life?Answer: Yes. Any maximum charge current that allows the battery to meet RFQ requirementsat or below 73A is acceptable. Question: We do not understand the meaning or contents of paragraph 5.4, what is therelevance of this paragraph to a proposed battery solution?Answer: Your proposed battery solution must be capable of delivering 7220W continuous for35 minutes in the off-nominal fault case where 1/6th of the ISS Li-ion ORUs fail toperform. The remaining functional battery ORUs will have their power demands increase by20%. The life requirement must be met or exceeded while operating at the nominal 6000Wlevel. Question: For the CEV, the continuous power of 4938W seems high when compared to 20% DODon a 3361Wh BOL battery. The 20% DOD would equate to an energy content per orbit of672Wh.	Dividing the 672Wh by the power of 4938W gives 0.136 hours or 8.2 minutes. Ourquestion is this correct for the presumed CEV use?Answer: The 4938W continuous covers a contigency return operational condition that willnot be restricted by the 20% DoD LEO limit. The CEV has many mission phases other thatLEO.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled FY2009 IPP SEED FUND CALLANNOUNCEMENT which was posted on February 19, 2009.  The Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) provides technology for NASAs MissionDirectorates, Programs and Projects through investments and technology partnerships withindustry, academia, government agencies and national laboratories. As one of NASA'sMission Support Offices, IPP supports all four Mission Directorates and has programoffices at each of the ten NASA Centers. The IPP Partnership Seed Fund over the last fewyears has demonstrated success by enhancing NASA's ability to meet mission technologygoals by providing seed funding to address barriers and initiate cost-shared,joint-development partnerships. The IPP Seed Fund is used to provide "seed" funding toenable larger partnerships and development efforts to occur and will encourage, to themaximum extent possible, the leveraging of funding, resources and expertise from non-NASApartners, NASA Programs and Projects and NASA Centers.This Call to NASA Centers is soliciting proposals for cost-shared partnerships withindustry, academia, research institutions, national laboratories and other governmentagencies for joint development of technology that is of Mission interest to NASA. Awardsmade under this Call are contingent upon NASA budget appropriations and fundingavailability.  This solicitation is being distributed through the NASA Center IPP Offices(IPPO). In order to solicit external interest for partnerships through this Call, thisAnnouncement is posted to Fedbizopps.gov and the http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/	  website. Responses to this Announcement must involve partnerships with NASA and bereceived from NASA personnel participating as a Partnership Manager (PM) in the CenterIPP Office; with proposals including both an internal NASA Co-Principal Investigator(Co-PI) and an External Co-PI.	Proposals submitted directly from parties external toNASA will not be accepted.Proposed projects, due for submission by April 30, 2009*, must include one or morenon-NASA partners in addition to non-IPP NASA partners who are committed to cost-share ata desired level at least equal to or greater than the IPP funding provided to theproject. For prior Seed Fund projects in the aggregate, additional internal NASAresources have typically matched IPP funds with external resources matching total NASAresources for a nearly 4:1 total leveraging for the project, relative to the IPP funding. Higher leveraging is desired and may enable more awards. Acceptable cost-sharing fromthe partner excludes any sunk costs and includes only actual dollars applied directly tothe project, in-kind considerations such as workforce labor and the use of unique anddedicated facilities and testbeds. Monetary valuation of partner in-kind facility and/ortestbed access should be based solely on actual costs incurred by the partner in theperformance of the proposed project, and should not reflect the partner'salready-incurred cost for developing the technology including the original capitalexpenditure for construction of the subject facilities and/or testbeds. * FY 2009 Seed Fund is on hold. Original proposal due date of April 30th to be extendedif funding issues can be resolved.For further information and questions regarding this announcement, including the fullPartnership Seed Fund Call for Proposals  2009, visit the IPP Seed Fund website(http://ipp.nasa.gov/ti_seed_fund.htm	  ) or kindly contact the IPP Points of Contactat any of the ten NASA Centers listed below.

<DESC>This announcement is amended to note that:

The anticipated approach has been reconsidered.  It has been determined that the additional work does not constitute a new requirement, but is necessary to allow the contractor to complete the database associated with the influenza virus as originally required under the existing contract.  The need for the additional work was caused by a substantial increase in data associated with the mutation and spread of the influenza virus after Contract award.  While the additional work was unknown at the time of award, it could be reasonably anticipated by the original field of offerors and has been determined to be within scope.  Accordingly, in lieu of a sole source action, this requirement will be accomplished via a within scope change to the existing contract.  

In order to maximize future competition the NIAID contemplates full and open competition in fiscal year 2013.

This announcement is to notify Industry to stand-down on the UC-35C/D CLS competition.

As discussed under announcement (RFI) N00019-09-P7-ZD066, and also at the UC-35 CLS Pre-Solicitation Conference, NAVAIR has been contemplating combining Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for its C-26D and UC-35C/D aircraft.

After receiving an overall positive response from industry, NAVAIR has decided to move forward with the combined effort.  Therefore, the UC-35C/D CLS requirement is now being delayed with the intention of combining it with the requirement for the C-26D CLS.

NAVAIR intends on posting a combined synopsis within the next 2 months.  It is anticipated that the combined RFP will be released during the 1st quarter of 2010.

<DESC>Dear Sir/Madam:

The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development Regional Mission to Central Asia (USAID/CAR), is seeking proposals to provide the services described in the attached Request for Proposals.  The purpose of the activity is to procure technical assistance, training, equipment and commodities to assist the Central Asian republics to improve the quality, scope, and coordination of health services.  By incorporating modern quality improvement techniques and evidence-based international standards into ongoing reforms of health systems, this program will assist Central Asian countries to improve their management, financing, and implementation of medical services provided for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, and primary health care. 

You are invited to submit a proposal in accordance with the requirements of the RFP.  This procurement shall be conducted through full and open competition, under which any type of organization is eligible to compete.  The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  

Please consider the following information: There are not any registration concerns with the countries of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  However, the laws and decrees in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan require that foreign legal entities must be registered to do business within those countries. These procedures are quite lengthy and it may take up to a year or longer before an organization knows whether its registration is accepted by the host governments.  In Turkmenistan, implementing partners who do not have an existing relationship with the government have not been able to effectively function, though registration of foreign NGO branch offices is not a legal requirement.  Given the in-country operating environments for Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan in relation to registration and presence, the offeror through itself, or subcontractors, or joint-venture members must demonstrate current registration in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and an established presence in Turkmenistan.  Information on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in such countries can be found through various English and Russian-language websites and NGO organizations.  We also encourage organizations which are registered in Tajikistan or Uzbekistan or have an established presence in Turkmenistan to express their status as such on the Interested Vendor List at www.fbo.gov to assist in making this information known to others.

If you decide to submit a proposal, it must be presented in accordance with the attached solicitation and received no later than 5:00 p.m., local Almaty, Kazakhstan, time on May 4, 2009 at the place shown below. Proposals and modifications thereof, should be submitted with the name, street address, telephone number, internet email address of a point-of-contact who is an authorized agent of the offeror and Request for Proposal Number inscribed thereon, must be addressed to:

Since October 1, 2003, it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually. You may access CCR at www.bpn.gov. Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS. No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. You may access FedTeDS via the following URL https://www.FedTeDS.gov. You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitledRegister with FedTeDS and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's , CCR Point of Contact )your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number),Your Telephone Number and Your E-Mail Address. Also, Beginning January 1, 2005, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) all vendors will be required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website for amendments, if any, to the solicitation.

<DESC>This is a revision to PRESOLICITATION NOTICE M67854-09-R-3025 Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) previously issued on 25 February 2009.  MARCORSYSCOM, now in conjunction with US Army PEO Soldier, intends to procure prototype combat helmets for evaluation with the option to field additional quantities of helmets.  The forthcoming solicitation will be issued on the basis of full and open competition.  The NAICS code remains 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing, with a size standard of 500.  This is a revision to a Presolicitation Notice only; no proposals are being requested at this time.  Information contained in this notice is subject to change.
MARCORSYSCOM and PEO Soldier are interested in investigating an Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH), capable of meeting all current combat helmet requirements (i.e., USMC Lightweight Helmet and US Army Advanced Combat Helmet), but exhibiting significantly improved ballistic performance (minimum 35% increase compared to current minimums) against fragmentation, handgun and small arms threats. The specified geometry of these helmets for the Marine Corps' requirements - full PASGT geometry, tactical (MICH/ACH) geometry, or both - is as yet undecided but will be stated in the solicitation.  The specified geometry for the Army's requirements will be the ACH.  Suspension/retention systems for all helmets will be from approved mandatory sources of supply.  Interested offerors will be limited to two material solutions (maximum of two (2) proposals each) for the ECH based on the current state-of-the-art materials.  If the Marine Corps selects the full PASGT geometry, offerors will be limited!  to a maximum of four (4) proposals each, two material solutions per geometry.
Offerors must be able to demonstrate the capability to produce an ECH with the minimum V50s and not exceeding the maximum weights at the time of proposal submission.  One or more product demonstration models (consisting of a complete helmet with the currently approved mandatory source of supply suspension/retention systems) will be required as part of the proposal submittal.  Complete requirements for the written proposal(s) will be set forth in the solicitation, but it is anticipated they will include the following among others: material composition and lay-up, description of basic manufacturing processes, shell weights and thicknesses, rapid production capabilities and delivery schedule, and ballistic performance.  Ballistic test data required will include V50s for the 2-, 4-, 16-, and 64-grain Right Circular Cylinder (RCC) and the 17 grain Fragment Simulating Projectile (FSP) generated on actual helmets (not flat panels) from an NIJ-approved test lab. 
The Government anticipates making multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract awards.  Awards will consist of initial minimum quantities of up to 50 helmets per size in sizes small, medium, large, and extra large, per material solution proposed per geometry (for a potential maximum quantity of 800 per contract (or 200 per solution per geometry).  These helmets will be subjected to a battery of tests to be specified in the solicitation.  If further evaluation is required, the Government may purchase additional prototype quantities above the contract minimum.  These additional line items may consist of one to several hundred helmets per size, but no more than 2,000 each per contract.  Contract awards will also consist of additional option line items for production units, to be exercised based on the results of further evaluation.  There will be separate line items for production units for the Marine Corps' and Army's requirements.  The estimated total qua! ntity for production for Marine Corps requirements, distributed among one or more potential awardees, is 38,500 each to include spares and tariff adjustments.  The estimated total quantity for production for Army requirements, distributed among one or more potential awardees, is 200,000 each to include spares and tariff adjustments.  The total quantities for both Marine Corps and Army requirements for this ECH effort are 238,500 helmets.  Although each awarded contract may include a maximum ceiling of 238,500, under this current urgent and compelling need, it is the Government's intent to only purchase 238,500 helmets distributed among the awardees selected to go to production.  The basis for making the production option exercise decision will be set forth in the solicitation, but the Government anticipates considering the ballistic performance (V50) against fragmentation, handgun and small arms (V50 and V0) in making its determination for production, along with delivery sc! hedule and price.
Evaluation factors will be set forth in the forthcoming solicitation.  Solicitation No. M67854-09-R-3025 is anticipated to be issued within the next thirty (30) days and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address:     http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  The on-line version of the solicitation will include all documents of the solicitation package.  No hard copy of this solicitation will be issued.  Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the original solicitation.  The complete solicitation package, including amendments, should be received and reviewed prior to submitting a response.  The proposal shall be submitted in hard copy form only.  No electronic submission of proposals will be accepted.  Those responding to the solicitation have the responsibility to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents. !   Offerors are instructed to hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued.  Offerors shall submit ALL questions in writing to lisandra.torres@usmc.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted.
