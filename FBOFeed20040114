<RESPDATE>012204
<ARCHDATE>02212004
<CONTACT>Dixie Harper, (202) 493-5940
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a sole source contract to UNITECH Incorporated to continue technical support services currently provided under the Broadband Information Technology Services (BITS) I contract, DTFA01-98-C-00072, which expires on January 31, 2004. This sole source contract is for a period of performance from February 1, 2004 through April 30, 2004.  The estimated contract value for the three-month period will be $600,000. The purpose of the sole source contract is to allow continuation of technical support services with minimal disruption pending the award of the Business and Financial Management Services (BFMS) and the Technical Engineering and Operations Management (TEOM) contracts.  It is anticipated that support services will be transitioned within thirty days of the BFMS and TEOM contracts.  The BFMS and TEOM contracts are to be awarded within the next sixty days. Background â€“ UNITECH Incorporated has been providing technical support services on a continuing basis for the following tasks: a.	Asia Pacific - The FAA, the U.S. representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), provides technical support to all working groups, participates in all conferences and meetings related to the improvement of existing international Aeronautical Fixed Services (AFS), and provides leadership in the development of Air Traffic Management (ATM) as it applies to ground to ground telecommunications of the future. b.	WAFS - The World Area Forecast System (WAFS) is a system for the worldwide broadcast of aviation related weather information via satellite. It is a joint effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS), with additional contributions from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Kingdom, Finland, and Canada. c.	Telecommunications Information Management System (TIMS) - To acquire, operate, and manage our telecommunications assets more effectively, the FAA uses the Telecommunications Information Management System (TIMS).    d.	Cost Assistance and Avoidance Program (CAAP) - The Cost Avoidance and Assistance Program (CAAP) reviews and evaluates system efficiencies and cost effectiveness of telecommunications services to support all FAA operational and administrative activities.   e.	ATN International - The FAA is the U.S. representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), provides technical support to all working groups, participates in all conferences and meetings related to the improvement of existing international Aeronautical Fixed Services (AFS), and provides leadership in the development of Air Traffic Management (ATM) as it applies to ground to ground telecommunications of the future. f.	MEVA â€“ Mejoras al Enlace de Voz del (MEVA) - Air Traffic Service is a program that provides modern voice and data circuit connectivity for FAA Air Traffic Control communications between the United States and ICAO member countries of the Caribbean and Latin America Regions.  Approximately 16 ICAO member countries have formally joined the MEVA program. g.	Process improvement - In the process improvement area, AOS-600 is actively moving toward iCMM (integrated Capability Maturity Model) standardization of processes, in accordance with Agency goals. Rationale for Single-Source Contract Award â€“ The FAA requires continuing support without disruption for the tasks identified above.  These tasks are of utmost importance in ensuring that the Telecommunications Management Division is able to sustain services to its customers and users.  It would be counterproductive to transition the technical support services currently being provided by UNITECH Incorporated to an interim, competitive contract and then to the pending Business and Financial Management Services (BFMS) and/or the Technical Engineering and Operations Management (TEOM) contracts when awarded.     Impact of Not Awarding the Single-Source Contract to UNITECH Incorporated - Failure to award the single-source contract to UNITECH Incorporated will result in a gap in services because of the time required to award a competitive contract.  AOS-600 will not be able to quickly respond to the demands of customers and users.  Examples of the impact are as follows: Â·	The Telecommunications Information Management System (TIMS) help desk and software maintenance support would not be staffed and both customers and users would not be able to provision services or query the database. Â·	Execution of International Civil Aeronautical Organization (ICAO) agreements would be disrupted and we would be in breech of the agreements on international programs, such as the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN), Asia Pacific, and MEVA. Â·	Dissemination of the World Area Forecast System (WAFS) information would be potentially impacted and we would be in breech of international agreements if not provided in a prompt manner.    If anyone feels they can immediately meet the criteria please contact Dixie Harper at dixie.harper@faa.gov.

<DESC>21 CONS/LGCZ, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), intends to offer the privatization of the electrical, natural gas, potable water, and wastewater utility infrastructure systems at Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB), California. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. If privatized, the successful offeror shall assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s) and provide all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The successful offeror shall be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the Government. The successful offeror shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The successful offeror shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain, and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the subsequent contract. The operation and maintenance contract(s) will be governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Transfers of property and grants of access are authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2688. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW), an attachment to the Request for Proposal (RFP), as it grants access to the system(s). Transfer of title to the utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale after meeting the licensing and permit requirements defined in the subsequent contract. Past Performance information from potential offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Vandenberg AFB, California, electric, natural gas, potable water, and wastewater utility systems supporting a base population of approximately 16,000 people.  
	Vandenberg AFB, located eight miles north-northwest of Lompoc, California, is an AFSPC installation that conducts polar-orbiting space launches and supports research and development tests and launch range operations for DoD, USAF, and NASA space, ballistic missile, and aeronautical systems and commercial space launches.  Also, the base provides test support for DoD space and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems as well as furnished facilities and essential services to more than 36 aerospace contractors.  Vandenberg AFB occupies 98,400 acres, has a 15,000-foot runway, and 5,019 facilities totaling 10,896,135 sq ft.  This number includes 1,913 military family housing (MFH) units and 3,099 industrial facilities.  
The following information provided is only an estimate of the size, scope and general description of the electrical, natural gas, potable water and wastewater utility systems, and is subject to change.  Utilities to be privatized include those located on Vandenberg AFB proper, Vandenberg Village (7 miles away) and Vandenberg Oak Mountain (25 miles away). 
Electrical power is generated by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).  The power plant on base is excluded from the UP effort.  Vandenberg AFB receives electrical power from PG&E at the Orcutt Substation and from a 70 KV PG&E line feeding an Air Force-owned switching station on Corral Road.  An Air Force-owned 70 KV line feeds nine Air Force-owned substations.  There are 545 miles of electrical lines on the base. Approximately 1.98 million linear feet of electrical service is overhead, while approximately 671,504 linear feet underground.  Electrical power consumption for FY97 was 182,497,304 kWh.  Peak usage during one month of that year was 48,530,086 kWh, and minimum usage was 10,702,377 kWh.  The system is capable of supporting projected future demands for electrical power without new construction.  
The only natural gas system to be privatized is located on the main base and is supplied to the base by Southern California Gas Company (SCGC).  The distribution system consists of approximately 596,000 linear feet of piping.  There are 83 miles of gas line on base.  Two regulating stations reduce pressure from 400 psi to 45 psi and feed two ten-inch lines.  The North base system is 85% polyethylene (PE) and the South base system is 90% steel.  Gas consumption in FY98 was 5,910,910 therms.  Peak usage in December was 934,178 therms.  44% of consumption is in the family housing areas.  Gas demand is expected to decline as old buildings are demolished.
Potable water systems are to be privatized at Vandenberg AFB and each satellite location.  The main base system consists of approximately 24,000 linear feet of piping. Vandenberg Village has a system of less than 5,000 linear feet.  There are two water sources, the California Aqueduct and the San Antonio wellfield, located on base.  Aqueduct water is brought to the base by the Central Coast Water Authority (CCWA).  The CCWA water is treated at the Polonio Pass Water Treatment Plant and is delivered to the base by a 140-mile pipeline that also feeds numerous retail water distributors in the area.  This pipeline is 39 inches in diameter and is known as the Coastal Branch Aqueduct (CBA.).  The San Antonio wellfield has four wells connected to the system, and several other wells either disconnected or being used only for agriculture.  The wells are in good physical condition but the water quality is poor and it must be aerated to remove hydrogen sulphides, chlorinated, and fluoridated before blending with CCWA water.  There are three water treatment plants on base, the main one (The San Antonio Plant) and two remote plants on South base near C-tank and facility 707.  The fire protection system is also to be privatized and is provided by hydrants connected to the potable water system.  There are approximately 1,200,000 feet of pipe in the water system.  There are two 36-inch backbones and an 8-inch line connecting North and South base.  
Wastewater systems will be privatized on the main base and the housing area.  There are 118 miles of sewer line and 15 lift stations, consisting of approximately 653,000 linear feet.  The main base area is almost entirely a gravity system.  Line sizes range from six to 24 inches, and construction includes compressed tarpaper, clay, cast iron, and asbestos-cement.  Most of the system was installed in the 1940s and 1950s.  All main base sewage is treated by the city of Lompoc, which is fed with an 18-inch line.  The South Vandenberg complex, consisting of South base and three launch complexes, has its sewage treated by oxidation ponds, and in the case of launch complex 6, a package treatment plant.  
All four systems are relatively old, with many components having been installed in the ‘40s and ‘50s.  There have been numerous joint leaks in the relatively new PE gas pipe on North base.  The water system has low pressure in the southwest part of Vandenberg base.  The peak flows on the sewer system exceed the line capacity of the 18-inch line leaving the base, moving toward the Lompoc plant, and a lined detention pond is used for storage.  
The points of contact for Vandenberg AFB, CA, are Mr Ben Chaib, Contracting Officer,  (719) 554-2731, email at ben.chaib@peterson.af.mil, and Ms Tracy Douglas, Contract Specialist, (719) 554-2848, email at tracy.Douglas@peterson.af.mil, and the fax number is (719) 554-2744. 
 The RFP is expected to be released to industry on or about 16 February 2004.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking a contractor to provide regulatory and technical support in gathering, interpreting and summarizing a vast amount of preclinical and clinical data associated with cancer preventive agents.   These data are generated by the scientific community and NCI funded projects.  The contractor will be responsible for regulator submissions to support the DCP’s chemoprevention development and clinical research program.  The contractor will develop and implement procedures for accessing, reviewing and compiling scientific, safety and clinical data for possible inclusion in Investigational New Drug (IND) and other regulatory submissions. The task areas of the statement of work include support for 1) regulatory submissions; 2) regulatory correspondence and administrative tracking; 3) safety activities; 4) maintenance of collaborating research agreement records; 5) coordination and documentation of regulatory meetings; 6) document management; 7) regulatory review, reporting and advisory activities; 8) process and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) standard operating procedures (SOPs) and 9) information management system.  The contractor will prepare and maintain documents required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trials of investigational agents. The proposed acquisition is a recompetition of contract N02-CN-05008 awarded to CCS Associates, Inc. Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made on the basis of a cascading evaluation preference approach.  It is anticipated that one (1) level of effort, TERM type contract will be awarded and that the period of performance will consist of a base period of five (5) years plus two (2) option years for a possible total of seven (7) contract years.  This applicable NAICS Code is 541519.  The award will be made to an eligible business concern included in one of the following three (3) cascading preference tiers, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at fair market price (see definition at FAR part 19).  Adequate competition is defined as the receipt of at least two (2) competitive proposals in a tier from companies that are qualified, technically acceptable, cost reasonable and responsible business concerns.  The cascading evaluation is to be applied in the following manner: First Tier Competition - is defined by competition among eligible HUBZone small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  In the event that competitive and price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition for this Tier will stop.  However, the one qualified firm from this Tier will become eligible to compete in the Second Tier Competition.  Second Tier Competition is defined by competition among eligible small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  If no proposal received for the First Tier Competition is determined to be eligible for award and only one proposal received for the Second Tier Competition is determined to be eligible for award, the Government will consider a Third Tier Competition.  Third Tier Competition is defined as an unrestricted, full and open competition with selection of an awardee based upon a best value determination pursuant to FAR 15.3.  This solicitation will be available electronically on or about February 1, 2004.  The RFP may be accessed through Internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this Internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS-This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of one firm-fixed price construction contract. The 100 percent Plans and Specifications Request For Proposal procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  This project is to restore cathodic protection systems at various locations on POL fuel facilities at Shaw Air Force Base, Sumter, South Carolina. The work will primarily consist of installing two deep well anode systems for the fuel transfer piping. It will also consist of installing test stations, isolation fittings, and electrical continuity bonding as well as installing small galvanic CP systems, hull anodes, for fuel lines located in trenches. The estimated cost for this acquisition is between $153,900 and $171,000. The maximum allowed completion schedule is 180 days. Utilizing a single-phase approach, the Government requires contractors to submit a price and technical proposal. Each proposal shall contain the offeror's best technical proposal and best price. Award will be made to the offeror whose technical and price proposal offers the best overall value to the Government, without discussion of such offers. The technical proposal is equal to the price proposal and will be evaluated as set forth below. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the offeror. Proposers will be evaluated on Technical Factors as follows: Factor A--Past Performance; Factor B--Technical Qualifications; and Factor C--Technical Approach.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO AWARD THIS CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offerors to revise their proposals. Firms submitting technical and price proposal will not be compensated for specifications. If award is not made on initial proposals, then a competitive range determination will be made for this solicitation which will be based on technical and price and include the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  For evaluation purposes only in determining the competitive range, the Government will calculate the total price proposal.  After a competitive range determination is made and final proposal revisions-if necessary-are received, a BEST VALUE award decision will be made.  If discussions are conducted, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range.  At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal revision. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to  award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror 
submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  RFP ISSUE DATE - The Government intends to issue the Request For Proposals, RFP, electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, http://esol.navfac.navy.mil, on or about January 29, 2004. A pre-proposal conference and site visit will be held within two weeks of issuance of the RFP at Shaw AFB.  The exact date, time, and location will be stipulated in the RFP.  Proposals will be due around March 2, 2004. The exact date will be stipulated in the RFP.  Offerors must register themselves on the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. The official plan holders list will be maintained on and may be printed from the web site. Amendments will be posted on the web site for downloading. This will be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION. Please note that all contractors and potential contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, CCR, database with a DUNS number.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is soliciting offers for a contract to study the chemical disposition in mammals. The purpose of the project is to obtain detailed chemical disposition data from 3 to 6 studies of selected environmental contaminants or model compounds per year. Most of these studies will be required in laboratory rats (Fischer 344) and/or mice (B6C3F1); however, some studies may require other laboratory animals (other rodent species or dogs).  Most of the studies will address the disposition of organic chemicals or environmental contaminants; however, studies of inorganic chemicals may also be requested.  Individual studies may vary in complexity from preliminary investigations of chemical absorption to detailed studies of all phases of chemical disposition, toxicokinetics, and metabolism.  The immediate goal of these studies is to determine more accurately the doses for National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay studies.  The long range goal is the accumulation of data that will permit a better assessment of structure-activity for chemical absorption, metabolism and disposition in laboratory animals and to better interpret the significance of these data to man. A study shall consist of the determination of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a selected compound in a given species. Identification of unknown metabolites may be complex enough to be considered a separate study.  Estimation of toxicokinetic parameters may be requested for selected chemicals.  One or more studies per year may be requested to investigate the comparative metabolism of chemicals in human and rat liver microsomes or hepatocytes in vitro. The compounds for study shall be selected and provided by the Project Officer.  Unless a satisfactory analytical procedure is available for unlabeled compounds and both parties agree to its use, radio labeled compounds shall be provided to facilitate the assay.  In most instances, the initial studies shall be performed in male rats; however, the Project Officer shall reserve the right to require studies in female rats or additional species.  Male animals are studied initially to avoid the influence of estrogenic hormones on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.  The protocol for the study shall be developed by the Principal Investigator in cooperation with the Project Officer.  The government estimates that the project will require the work of 2 professional man-years and 3 technical/administrative personnel man-years in each contract year.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall have a minimum of 5 years Post-Doctoral Degree experience.  The estimated annual level of effort is 9,980 labor hours.  Award of one cost-reimbursement, level of effort contract (the work on the contract involves continuous activity with no clearly defined end point) on an open competition basis is contemplated as a result of this solicitation.  The contract obtained under this solicitation will continue the work of a similar contract.  The period of performance for the contract is five years, beginning on or about October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2009.   Interested organizations should telefax a request for RFP NIH-ES-04-01 to the attention of Mr. David Sedgley, Contract Specialist at (919) 541-2712 or send an e-mail request to sedgley@niehs.nih.gov.   The electronic version of the Fed Biz Ops synopsis will be available on the Internet at:  http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm.  An electronic copy of the RFP (without the NTP Specifications) will be posted to this site on or about January 29, 2004.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Expected release date of the RFP is January 29, 2004 with proposals due March 19, 2003.  This requirement is unrestricted.  NAICS Code is 541710.

<DESC>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management(OPM) intends to issue an RFP that will result in the award of a firm-fixed price requirements contract to provide services for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program’s Open Season for Annuitants.  The contractor will be required to design and print guides and envelopes, in addition to the distribution and processing of personalized materials related to the annual (FEHB) Annuitant Open Season.  Using a data base of approximately 1.8 million individuals supplied by the OPM, the Contractor prints, personalizes, and mails letters, notices, guides, and other informational materials to annuitants.   Subsequently, annuitants may request health benefits enrollment changes, and/or additional information by using, at a minimum Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology or other advanced technologies including the Internet.  The Contractor must then process these requests.  After the initial mailing, the Contractor must mail additional informational packages on a continuing basis, mail notices and enrollment change information to annuitants as well as the 200+ FEHBP plans.  The health benefits enrollment and address changes that result from processing are recorded and sent to OPM through electronic transmissions.  In addition, the Contractor must also be able to send this information through electronic transmissions to a centralized enrollment data “hub” and meet the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  Regardless of the volume received, the Contractor is required to process all actions within 3 days of receipt and with a high level of accuracy.  Throughout these processes, the Contractor is required to integrate a multifaceted operation, involving multiple phases, in order to perform the numerous and complex edit, and validation routines necessary to assure that the actions taken are appropriate.  Prior to the start of the Open Season, the contractor must perform a full scale test to validate its data base retrieval system and its automated processing system, which includes: (a) laser printing messages, letters and FEHBP plan information; (b) personalizing individual letters and notices from a Government provided data base; (c) processing open season requests including enrollment and address changes, requests for additional information, generating new individualized letters with printed error messages and/or other special notices, generating summaries of actions including enrollment changes for annuitants, enrollment changes for former spouses, requests for health benefits plan brochures, enrollment confirmation letters, special handling items and submitting those actions to OPM in an automated fashion; (d) generating a series of test reports and electronic transmissions in the format specified by OPM from the processed transactions.  The Contractor may be required, at any time during the Open Season period and with little notice, to provide additional programming services, design, print, fold, insert, and mail special notices to a large volume of individuals.  The Contractor must grant positive assurance that its electronic data processing systems, can routinely generate the required automated outputs in the volume and immediate turnaround time with the high degree of accuracy required by OPM.  The North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is 51114.  OPM intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract for the base year being April 01, 2004, through March 31, 2005, with four 1-year options.  Requests for copies of the solicitation should be received, in writing, no later than fifteen days from the date of this listing.  Solicitation Requests should be submitted to the attention of Ms. Terry L. Anderson at Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E. Street, NW, Room 1342, Washington, DC 20415.  E-mail request should be sent to tlanders@opm.gov.  Telephone requests will not be accept.  However, faxed requests are acceptable.  The fax number is 202-606-1464.  Only one copy of the RFP will be sent to each requestor.   The RFP will be available electronically on the FedBizOpps website.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED.  Additional specifications/information and a copy of the RFQ are available at the following website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  The solicitation number is U4RD05, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $6 million to qualify as  a small business, is applicable.  This solicitation is 100 percent set aside for small business.  A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  Under the project titled DETERMINATION OF GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS FROM TOTAL RNA EXTRACTS OF MOUSE  INTESTINAL TISSUE, the contractor shall use an animal model (i.e., mouse) and/or tissue culture, tissues or cells of mice to prepare total RNA extracts for microarray processing.  These extracts will be processed for evaluating changes in mRNA response to virulent versus avirulent strains.  Use of  the Affymetrix? protocol and scanner for all phases of the preparation and analysis of these samples is required, since it must be compatible with the Affymetrix equipment the US EPA possesses.  Mouse genome chips 430A and 430B or the human genome chips U133A and U133B from Affymetrix are used in  the testing.  The expectation is to be able to differentiate virulence pattens of host mRNA response to waterborne microorganism exposure.  The contractor shall perform the standard Affymetrix procedure for labeling and detecting gene expression profiles, as described in the Affymetrix Manual.  It  is expected that up to 100 samples will be provided for analysis.  The samples will be shipped in sets of 10 samples, approximately every 4 to 5 weeks.  The contractor shall provide the USEPA Project Officer with raw data files from the above testing. Specific experimental information shall be  defined using Affymetrix Microarray Suite on a PC-compatible workstation with a Windows NT operating system. The probe array type, sample description and comments shall be entered in Microarray Suite and saved with a unique experiment name. Data from the Affymetrix system shall be saved, stored and  delivered to USEPA on CDs.  The following file types are generates by the Affymetrix system and shall be provided by the contractor: .dat, .exp and cel.  The contractor shall critically assess output files for the following QC checks: 1. Probe Array Image (.dat) Inspection.  Inspect for the  presence of image artifacts (i.e., high/low intensity spots, scratches, high regional, or overall background, etc.) on the array, 2. GeneChip Analysis. The contractor shall confirm the alignment of the grid by zooming in on each of the four corners and on the center of the image. If the grid is not  aligned correctly, the contractor shall adjust the alignment. 3.  Average Background and Noise Values  Although there are no official guidelines regarding background, Affymetrix has found that typical Average Background values range from 20 to 100 for arrays scanned with GeneArray Scanners  calibrated to the new PMT setting (10% of maximum).  Arrays being compared should ideally have comparable background values.  4. Noise (Q) is a measure of the pixel-to-pixel variation of probe cells on a GeneChip.  Since a significant portion of Q is based on electrical noise, absolute Q values  among scanners will vary. Arrays being compared that were scanned on the same scanner should ideally have comparable Q values.  5.  B2 Oligo Performance  The boundaries of the probe area  shall be identified by the hybridization of B2 oligo, which must be  spiked into each hybridization cocktail.  Hybridization of B2 shall be highlighted on the image by the following: the alternating pattern of intensities on the border; the checkerboard pattern at each corner; and the array name, located in the upper-left or upper-middle of the array.  6. Poly-A Controls: The controls dap, lys, phe, thr,  trp must be run and must be present. 7. Hybridization Controls: bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre.  BioB is at the level of assay sensitivity (1:100,000 complexity ratio) and shall be called "Present" at least 50% of the time.  BioC, bioD, and cre shall always be called "Present" with increasing Signal  values, reflecting their relative concentrations.  8. Internal Control Genes  For GeneChip expression arrays, actin and GAPDH shall be used to assess RNA sample and assay quality.  Specifically, the Signal values of the 3' probe sets for actin and GAPDH shall be compared to the Signal values of the  corresponding 5' probe sets. The ratio of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set shall be no more than 3.  There will be three deliverables: 1.a work plan which describes the intended approach and/or protocol regarding how the work will generate quality data, 2. Ten CD(s) containing the analytical  results of each sample for each set of 10 RNA extract samples, 3. a final report.  Evaluation criteria to be included (with your quotation) in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: 1.  Price,  2.  Past Performance,  3.  Qualification of Key Personnel  4.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

 Q1. 	Will a proposal with a few full-time contracted staff be viewed more favorably than a proposal of numerous part-time contracted staff?  Example: Three contractors working full-time compared to, say, six contractors working half-time.
 
 A.	Based on the technical approach the staffing should be appropriately proposed. We did not however envisage FTE’s [in the cost estimates].
 
 Q2. 	Will it be possible to see a list of potential contractors (including lead proposal person and contact info) before the proposal deadline?  By "potential contractors" I mean those organizations/individuals who have registered with Mr Srivastava for updates to the RFP and/or who are otherwise known to be proposing.  The purpose being that knowledge of prospective bidders allows for teaming of organizations, if interested, to submit a single proposal.
 
 A. 	List of the Requestors of the RFP No. 386-04-004 is attached herein below.
 
 Q3.	The schedule for completion of tasks as laid out in the RFP is extremely compressed. We are prepared to put together a proposal that meets the timeline, but believe a more thorough job could be done if more time were available.  We wonder if the Mission would consider expanding the timeframe somewhat and, if so, whether the Mission could issue some additional guidance on acceptable parameters for the completion of tasks.
 
 A. 	We are running against time and there is no possibility of expanding timelines.
 
 Q4.	 The RFP is somewhat ambiguous about whether the successful contractor is expected to meet the operating costs of the new institution in its first year of operations, including staff salaries, office space, etc., in both India and the U.S. If so, our preliminary budgeting indicates that the proposed contract amount might be insufficient for this purpose. Would the Mission consider funding the direct costs of operating the new institution in its first year from another source or supplementing the available funds for this contract to meet these requirements?
 
 A. 	There is no ambiguity about the successful contractor meeting the operating costs and the Independent Govt. cost estimate is inclusive of all such costs. No, the mission would not consider funding direct costs of operating the new AIDA institution in its first year from other source[s] or supplementing the available funds for this contract.
 
 Q5.	 The cover letter for the RFP gives instructions for submission of the proposal in hard copy to the USAID Mission in India. In the General Instructions to Offerors on page L-6, the RFP indicates that electronic submission by email is acceptable. Can the Mission confirm that submission by email is acceptable?
 
 A. 	Though submission by email is acceptable, we insist that requisite copies be sent to RCO/USAID/India at the address provided in the RFP.
 
 Q6)	The anticipated last date for response ( we will of course keep checking your website for updates)?
 
 	A. 	The closing date remains firm as January 21, 2004.
 
 Q7.	Will the team be a sort of a project management unit working in USAID delhi for a dedicated period of time? If so, could you let us have some idea of the timeframe. Would the team deputed need to be full time employees of the bidding firm?
 
 A. 	No, the team is not envisaged to be based in USAID/New Delhi. All logistical support is to be provided by the successful contractor.
 
 Q8. 	Would recruitment of key staff also be a part of the assignment?
 
 	 A. 	Yes.
 
 Q9. a.	Deliverable 4: Task 13 and 14: Are we required to prepare the budget on our own or assist the board of directors in preparing the budget ?
 
 b. Deliverable 6: Task 19: Are we required to develop the manual on our own or only assist the AIDA in preparing the manual?
 
 A. 	For both 9a. & 9b - The successful contractor would develop manuals/budget, however the finalization of such would be subject to review and acceptance of the AIDA Board and USAID.
 
 Q10. 	Task 20: What would the preparation of financial reporting systems imply? We are assuming that we would provide assistance only in terms of reporting formats process to close books, process to collate information and management certificate confirming compliance of USAID reporting and monitoring standards.
 
 A. 	The assumption is correct. However this has to be integrated into the financial manuals & processes also to be developed by the successful contractor.
 
 Q11). 	Are we required to assist the management in procurement/development of financial reporting software?
 
 A. 	YES, The successful contractor will be required to develop the procurement manuals & FRS.
 
 Q12). 	Would this activity involve review of the periodic reporting to monitor compliance of the USAID guidelines and monitoring standards?
 
 A. 	No.
 
 Q13). 	Deliverable 8: What would the term “manage day to day operations” mean?
 
 A. 		It is envisaged that the successful contractor will provide support and backstopping functions for smooth functioning of AIDA till it becomes fully staffed/twelve month period whichever is earlier.
 
 Q14). 	It is not clear what is the meaning of management’s expenses. Does it mean the LOP investment of $12.3 million in Task 14 over a period of five years? In case it does, then what is the estimated amount to be spent in the first twelve months?
 
 A. 		By management expenses we mean the operating costs incurred for the first year of the smooth functioning of AIDA. We don’t envisage any programmatic expense during this period. The successful contractor is expected to propose a percentage or amount based on the estimated operating costs.
 
 Q15). 	The management support for a period of twelve months includes a number of accounting and related activities. What exactly are the expectations, for e.g. is the expectation that of a certain number of full time personnel and others on fixed hours basis, level of expertise etc.?
 
 A. 		Yes, it is expected that the successful contractor will provide backstop and support functions to the AIDA organization for a period of one year or until AIDA is fully staffed & operational, which ever is earlier.
 
 Q16). 	Do we want an interim entity to handle the payroll or would the employees be on the AIDA payroll?
 
 A. No interim entity is envisaged. The successful contractor to employ required Key staff on contractual basis, their continuation would depend upon performance, to be absorbed in AIDA once fully functional as stated in Task 29.
 
 Q17).	What is the source of initial funding and/or guarantor/promoter for the minimum capitalization of the company ?
 
 A. 		The initial subscriber capital is provided by the successful contractor (budgeted as plug Figure of $1000), the process however must comply with Indian laws & regulations.
 
 Q18). 	As listed on Page F-2, is there an expectation to submit a document on development experience apart from the relevant assignment credentials that we would submit along with the proposal?
 
 A. 		As listed on page F-2 under the clause F-8 the successful contractor is required to submit a copy electronically & a hard copy of the Report(s) generated as a result of the efforts under this SOW/activity to the PPC/CDIE/DI. However, relevant assignment credentials are expected as part of the proposal to be submitted to RCO/USAID/India only for evaluation purposes.
 
 Q19). 	Would Small business/ Disadvantaged business concern credential only mean using them as partners or can we include credential of work done for small/ disadvantaged businesses. Do such alliances need to be in US/ India/ anywhere in the world?
 
 A. 		No. It means ONLY using small businesses /disadvantaged businesses as partners / subs anywhere in the world under USAID /federal funding. NOTE: Only U.S. firms can be considered as small/disadvantaged, Non-US firms are not required to provide SB/SDBU details.
 
 Q20).	Would the members of the Board of Directors of AIDA be executive directors or non-executive (part-time)?
 
 A. 		Only Non-Executive (part-time).
 
 Q21).	Does the division of mandays between US and India against the various tasks have to be strictly as prescribed? Could we project a more realistic estimate of mandays?
 
 A. 		The offerors are expected to project realistic estimates of mandays, whether US expats or CCN/TCN. The estimate LOE provided in Section L.10 is only IGCE and for the purposes of initial budgeting.
 
 Q22). 	What does the cost estimation of USD 710,000 cover? Consultants fee and expenses only or does it also include registration fee etc. for the company  ?
 
 A. 		It does include registration fess etc. and all such other expenses for the initial first year.
 
 Q23). 	Task 23: In regard to the corporate structure of AIDA, the RFP suggests that AIDA would be incorporated as a Section 25 company. We wish to clarify if the above structure has now been frozen or is the option of registering AIDA as a society or trust still under contemplation/available?
 
 A. 		The decision to charter AIDA under section 25 is frozen.
 
 Q24). 	Task 23: Ordinarily AIDA would be required to obtain registration under the terms of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 - one of our tasks/deliverables would be to ascertain whether or not under any specific and/or general notifications, any exemption has been given by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to USAID and whether the same would be available to AIDA. In Addition to the above, approvals would be required from the RBI under current FEMA Regulations, for the inward remittances. In view of the specific milestones prescribed in the RFP, we wish to understand if the time taken to secure the approvals referred to above ffrom FCRA and RBI, have been factored therein?
 
 A. 		Our understanding is that no specific exemption is available to USAID. Yes, the time required to secure approvals referred herein have been factored.
 
 Q25). 	Task 24 and Task 27: In regard to engagement of key staff/support staff, we wish to attain better clarity on the structuring of the proposed employment contracts ie. Whether the personnel proposed to be engaged by AIDA shall be designated as Consultants or full-time employees of AIDA. Furthermore, in the event the staff are intended to be whole time employees, there could be issues related to their designation as workmen/supervisory staff, that will need to be analysed and the consequences of the staff being designated as workmen, if at all, will need to be detailed for the benefit of management.
 
 A. 		Under the current SOW, the key staff/support staff proposed will not be on AIDA payrolls but contracted by successful contractor to provide necessary services.
 
 
 Q26). 	Task 26: AIDA would be required to fulfill various statutory compliances prescribed under the Companies Act, Income Tax Act, and Foreign Contribution Regulation Act etc. Additionally, periodic information is also required to be filed with the FCRA authorities. We would perhaps be expected to review these and draft the necessary documents, incorporation charter documents, initial corporate compliances etc..?
 
 A.  		Yes.
 
 Q27). 	Deliverable 10: It is envisaged that AIDA would need to be obtain USAID pre-award certification. Presumably this certification entitles AIDA to receive USAID funds. We would like to understand what a USAID pre-award certification is? How is it obtained - procedure/standards/ qualifications etc? What is the assistance envisaged from consultants/legal advisors for obtaining such certification? How many pre-awards are expected each year?
 
 A. 	The USAID pre-award certification is given in ADS 303.5.9 which the new entity AIDA should comply.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 0002.  The purpose of this modification is to answer questions received from offerors.  The following clauses are being added:  1252.215-70 KEY PERSONNEL AND/OR FACILITIES and ADDENDUM TO TAR CLAUSE 1252.215-70 – KEY PERSONNEL AND/OR FACILITIES.  The Coast Guard will not accept any more questions after January 20, 2004. 

1.  QUESTION:  Please clarify that the maximum order is 35 workshops per year not 35 workshops over the life of the contract. 

ANSWER:  The maximum order quantity is 35 per year.

2.  QUESTION:  As a company that frequently performs workshops on military bases, including Coast Guard bases, it is our experience that laptops and LED projectors are usually provided by the base.  Using equipment already available on base could significantly help reduce the cost of this contract as LED projectors and laptops are expensive to purchase or lease.  Would Coast Guard entertain allowing the contractor to request permission to use base equipment?    

ANSWER:  The Contractor is responsible for providing their own laptop and LED.  Many of our classes are not done in facilities that provide and are setup for this type of seminar or offer this equipment.

3.  QUESTION:  Should the Cost Proposal and Technical Proposal be packaged separately or bound together? 

ANSWER:  Bound together.  Provide a total of 3 copies (1 original and 2 copies).  Volume I – Technical Proposal.  Volume II – Past Performance Information, Volume III – Cost Proposal.  The offeror must number the pages, and bind each set of Technical proposals, Past Performance and Price Proposals in a three-ring loose-leaf binder.  Submit resumes in each copy of Volume I under a tab divider.  

4.  QUESTION:  Are the lactations listed in the synopsis the only locations where workshops will be held? 

ANSWER:  No.  Coast Guard Transition Managers are responsible for regional areas.  We listed a few of the more predominant areas based on past history.  Other areas may include but are not limited to Seattle, WA, San Diego, CA, and areas of Texas.
  
5.  QUESTION:  I see that this is a 100% small business set-aside.  Are partnerships ok?  Or a prime/sub relationship?  Are there any requirements for other DBE like a native-American owned company?

ANSWER:  The Coast Guard has no restrictions.  In accordance with Clause 52.219-14 – Limitations on Subcontracting, states for services at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  

6.  QUESTION:  Is this a new requirement? 

ANSWER:  No, this is not a new requirement.

7.  QUESTION:  Is there an incumbent?  If so, who, and are they eligible to rebid? 

ANSWER:  Yes.  The incumbent contractors were Westward Systems, Inc., The Ryan Group, Inc., and Native American Management Services, Inc.  Yes, the incumbent contractors are eligible to rebid.

8.  QUESTION:  What is the maximum number of participants for each class A and class B sessions? 

ANSWER:  Attendance is an unknown factor.  Seminars are based on several factors such as number of military members separating, location, and operational commitments to name a few.

9.  QUESTION:  What is the total dollar amount the USCG has spent for these seminars in the past?

ANSWER:  The dollar amount is $677,435.97 over a five year period.   

10.  QUESTION:  How did the USCG arrive at the annual travel amount? 

ANSWER:  Travel was based upon past history in combination with the JTR.  Basic formulation used was:  maximum number of yearly seminars, destinations, times the daily per diem rates in accordance with the JTR.

11.  QUESTION:  To ensure that each technical proposal is evaluated fairly, what criteria will USCG use to rate the technical proposals? 

ANSWER:  The evaluation criteria are described in the combined synopsis/solicitation dated December 23, 2003.

12.  QUESTION:  Will USCG consider extending the due date since this notice was posted during the Christmas holidays? 

ANSWER:  Yes.  Proposals must be received by 2:00 PM EDT on January 23, 2004. 

13.  QUESTION:  Can you specify to what extent the contractor will be expected to cover Item #15, FINANCES, under the Preseparation Counseling Checklist, DD Form 2648? 

ANSWER:  Cover an overview of what members should be aware of when retiring, or separating from the military.

14.  QUESTION:  How many Seminar A and Seminar B sessions have been conducted at each location? 

ANSWER:  The number of seminars varies from year to year.  Listed are the number of A and B sessions conducted over the past five years:  Washington, DC (Seminar A – 2, Seminar B - 1), Boston, MA (Seminar A - 2), Miami, FL (Seminar A - 11), Alameda, CA (Seminar A - 31), Kodiak, AK (Seminar A - 12), New Orleans, LA (Seminar A - 3), Seattle, WA, (Seminar A - 9), Texas (Seminar  A - 4).

15.  QUESTION:  Please estimate the total number of spouses you anticipate attending, and clarify whether you want instructional material provided for them individually or do you see them sharing materials with their spouses.

ANSWER:  Spouses are encouraged and welcome to attend.  Those that do attend encompass approximately 10%.  Instructional material is expected to be provided for them as well.      

16.  QUESTION:  Since the travel expenses are not to exceed the limitations quoted, how do you suggest dealing with those expenses should the number of seminars ordered goes beyond the minimum quantity of 10?  Simply stated, if we are to assume that two instructors are on the road for 5 days for each program, our normal per diems and travel expense will exceed the limits well before the maximum of 35 was reached.  Since your office controls the number of programs to be conducted we would prefer clarification on this matter.

ANSWER:  It is our recommendation that the offeror review the JTR for further reference and Per Diem.  Government travel expenses will not exceed the threshold of 10 classes with 2 instructors within a five-day period.

17.  QUESTION:  Do you have an expectation for how the seminars will be allocated at the various locations.  In other words, do you anticipate an equal number to be conducted at all locations or do you believe that some cities will have more or fewer seminars based on employee size or other demographic information?

ANSWER:  Unfortunately, the number of seminars varies location by location, and that decision is determined by each regional Transition and Relocation Manager.  They are the area specialists, identifying the member needs, state by state and region by region.  The Coast Guard does not anticipate an equal number of seminars at each location.  Some cities may have more, while others may have none.  Seminars are based on several factors such as number of military members separating, location, and operational commitments.

18.  QUESTION:  The solicitation states that a minimum of 10, and a maximum of 35 seminars are estimated.  To ensure a more level field for all bidders, and for costing purposes, what number of seminars should we use to determine a cost?

ANSWER:  Base it on 10 because the Coast Guard is guaranteeing 10.  The number will likely be more than that, but we do not have any idea what it would be, but it will not be more than 35.    

19.  QUESTION:  How many days is Seminar B expected to run?

ANSWER:  Each seminar shall be a maximum of 3.5 days in length.

20.  QUESTION:  Would it make a difference if the Seminar Instructors had Master degrees?

ANSWER:    No.  The offeror should propose individuals who can fulfill the requirement.

21.  QUESTION:  Would it be feasible to have the assessment tools be completed on-line rather than paper?

ANSWER:  If the vendor would like to provide the assessment online rather than on paper that is perfectly acceptable.  However, not all members, have access to computers and only one Transition Relocation Manager has a classroom with 20 computers.  Most seminars are done in a hotel or in a room without access to online capabilities.  The vendor would have to come up with a way to administer the assessment.  Which may be quite difficult since Coast Guard members are not located at one place.  Coast Guard members are located at several different areas and will be from several different units.  
   
22.  QUESTION:  Would it be advantageous to have a 3 ½ - 4 day seminar?

ANSWER:   3 to 3.5 days is an appropriate amount of time for a seminar.  Students tend to travel on Mondays and Fridays and attend the seminar Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

23.  QUESTION:  Will the contract be split with more than one contractor?

ANSWER:   The contract will be awarded to one contractor.

24.  QUESTION:  The last contract award was for what total, excluding travel?

ANSWER:   Native American Management Services, Inc. was awarded a contract in the amount of $672,597.00.  Westward Systems, Inc. was awarded a contract in the amount of $1,393,736.00.  The Ryan Group, Inc was awarded a contract in the amount of $1,280,411.00.   

25.  QUESTION:  What other questions have been asked and what were the responses?

ANSWER:  The modification is providing all of the questions and answers received to date.

26  QUESTION:  What is the average number of participants per seminar?

ANSWER:  35 is the maximum number of students.  On an APPROXIMATE average 25-29 students attend each seminar.  

27.  QUESTION:  Are the six locations listed in the solicitation the only ones to be serviced?

ANSWER:  No.  Coast Guard Transition Managers are responsible for regional areas.  We listed a few of the more predominant areas based on past history.  Other areas may include but are not limited to Seattle, WA, San Diego, CA, and areas of Texas.

28.  QUESTION:  Is there a service provider who has been conducting the seminars in the past?

ANSWER:  The contract was awarded to Westward Systems, Inc., The Ryan Group, Inc., and Native American Management Services, Inc. 

29.  QUESTION:  The RFP requires the contractor to “use the most current Department of Labor (DOL) Transition Assistance Manual.  Materials and topics must be presented in accordance with the table of contents.” Could you please advise as to where we can see this document?

ANSWER:  For more information on the Transition Assistance Program (TAP MANUAL) and the Program, can be found at:  <http://www.dol.gov/vets/> scroll down to: Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Information http://www.dol.gov/vets/www.dol.gov/vets/tap/Rpt-Summary.htm The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Manual 

Sections 1 - 2   <http://www.dol.gov/vets/tap/TAP1  2.pdf>
Sections 3 – 4   <http://www.dol.gov/vets/tap/TAP3  4.pdf>
Sections 5 – 6   <http://www.dol.gov/vets/tap/TAP5  6.pdf>

30.  QUESTION:  Would you consider a proposal limited to separating or retiring Coast Guard attorneys?

ANSWER:  This contract is for all members of the Coast Guard and does not offer exclusive assistance to one group over another.  What we have found is that all our professions and occupations have unique career transition requirements, that differ remarkably from one another, and it is the uniqueness of their differences and the blending of the combination of those professions in our seminars, that builds a network of transitional network, and opportunities that raises the bar of the current Coast Guard transition Classes.  

31.  QUESTION:  Our question is whether there is a outline to follow for the proposal submission and any other requirements such a formal registration requirement to precede the submission.

ANSWER: Submit proposals in three separate volumes.  Provide a total of 6 copies (1 original and 5 copies).  Volume I – Technical Proposal.  Volume II – Past Performance Information, Volume III – Cost Proposal.  The offeror must number the pages, and bind each set of Technical proposals, Past Performance and Price Proposals in a three-ring loose-leaf binder.  Submit resumes in each copy of Volume I under a tab divider.  

32.  QUESTION:  Is the RFP information that was posted on the Febizopps the full RFP?  If not, can you give us the link to access the full RFP?

ANSWER:  Yes.  The RFP information that was posted in FedBizopps on December 23, 2003, is the full RFP.

33. QUESTION:  Can our proposal be emailed to the identified office instead of regular mail?  

ANSWER:  Yes.  The proposal must identify each submission separately. 

34.  QUESTION:  The synopsis/solicitation (s/s) indicated that there were two enclosures provided with the s/s but I was unable to access those.  Please provide information on “HOW TO” access these two documents.

ANSWER:  If you were unable to access the two documents you can send a e-mail with your fax number, to squeen@comdt.uscg.mil and croyster@comdt.uscg.mil and a copy will be faxed to you.

35.  QUESTION:  FAR 12.6 provides for use if “evaluation factors” are used, but I could not find the “Evaluation Factors For Award” in the s/s.  Would you please provide an explanation as to how you intend to evaluate this s/s and what those factors are and there relative importance.

ANSWER:   This information was provided under the synopsis dated December 23, 2003.  The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors: (i) Technical capability: offeror shall submit the following information for technical evaluation: (a) Describe your technical approach for satisfying the requirements for Seminar A and Seminar B, including any topics that you intend to address in each seminar that are in addition to those required by the solicitation, (b) Describe how you will recruit and hire qualified seminar instructors; (ii) Past Performance: Provide a list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders completed during the past 3 years; a list of similar contracts currently in process; or a combination of both.  Similar contracts listed may include any contract entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers.  Include the following formation: (a) Name of Contract Activity; (b) Contract Number, (c) Contract Type; (d) Total Contract Value; (e) Description of Contract Work; (f) Contracting Officer Name and Telephone Number; (g) Program Manager Name and Telephone Number (if applicable); (h) Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative Name and Telephone Number; and (i) Administrative Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (if different from (f)); and (iii) Price:  The Government will award the contract to the offeror who has the best overall value on the basis of its offer and its capability to perform the work.  Technical capability and past performance are of equal importance, and when combined are of more importance than price.

36.  QUESTION:  The requirement for the contractor to hold a “progress meeting with the COTR and/or Alternate COTR upon request of the Government” should be quantified due to this request being so open ended that any bidder would be unable to develop a cost for this requirement and the Government may receive higher bids than necessary.  The same issue applies to these meetings being conducted by three different methods: 1) telephone, 2) e-mail, and/or 3) in person at the discretion of the government.  The associated costs of bidding this effort is substantially different if conducted by telephone and e-mail as opposed to having the contractor conduct the meeting “in person.”  Since there was no “geographic limitation” provided in the s/s, this requirement does not take into account those contractors that may be located outside the “beltway.”

ANSWER:  Scheduled within 10 days after award of contract, the first meeting shall be in person.  Schedule meetings after the initial meeting can be telephonic.  

37.  QUESTION:  The request for resumes did not identify how these resumes were to be evaluated.  This is similar to our request for evaluation factors for Question 2.

ANSWER:  The resumes will be used to identify Key Personnel under the contract.

38.  QUESTION:  Could you please provide where we can obtain the document information so we can ensure that our employees” …observe and comply with all applicable local and headquarters regulations, policies and procedures” etc. as required by the s/s.

ANSWER:  The intent of the referenced sentence was for the contractor to follow along with all procedures and rules while on a military base.  The individual bases will provide/post those regulations upon entry.

39.  QUESTION:  In other solicitations, we have observed that “travel” reimbursement has been “exclusive” of G&A.  We would appreciate an explanation on whether G&A is to be allowed under this s/s.

ANSWER:  Because of the extent of travel being propose the Coast Guard recognizes that the offeror will incur additional cost, therefore travel will be inclusive of G&A. 

40.  QUESTION:  You refer to the contractor providing “…sufficient qualified personnel for adequate and timely service.”  Please provide the governments definition of” …sufficient qualified personnel…” under this RFQ.

ANSWER:  Qualified personnel means: a) Bachelor’s degree in any field and b) three years experience providing career services.  In lieu of a Bachelors degree, equivalent work experience may be substituted on the basis that a Bachelors degree equals six years work experience.  Any substituted work experience shall be in addition to the required stated minimum of three years experience providing career services.  Adequate and timely service means being prompt for the seminar start times, and covering all topics required.

41.  QUESTION:  Can you tell us approximately how many participants will be scheduled to attend per class?

ANSWER:   Unfortunately, the number of attendees varies year by year and location by location.  Based on the number of seminars that are held within the region that each transition Manager is responsible for.  Attendance is an unknown factor.  Seminars are based on several factors such as number of military members separating, location, and operational commitments to name a few.

42.  QUESTION:  Will there spouses be required to attend as well?

ANSWER:  Spouses are encouraged and welcome to attend.  Those that do attend encompass approximately 10%.  Instructional material is expected to be provided for them individually.       

43.  QUESTION:  Please estimate the number of expected attendees for Seminar A (enlisted and officer ranks) and Seminar B (flag officers and executive level) either by location or anticipated total attendance for all locations for the base year.

ANSWER:  Unfortunately, the number of attendees varies year by year and location by location.  Based on the number of seminars that are held within the region that each transition Manager is responsible for.  Attendance is an unknown factor.  Seminars are based on several factors such as number of military members separating, location, and operational commitments to name a few.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Proposal number is N62645-04-R-0003.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-16 are incorporated.  NAICS 423450.  Naval Medical Logistics Command has the following requirement for a ceiling mounted medical examination light.  The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with a 3-year ordering period containing a minimum for 22 units and a maximum of 500.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with Offerors on an open competition basis to procure ceiling mounted medical examination lights for Navy ships of the line.  Offerors are required to forward proposal and technical documentation by  21 Jan 04. 

Technical evaluations will be conducted in three stages. Stage 1 is compliance with minimum salient essential characteristics. Stage 2 will be the evaluation of Past Performance information and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. Stage 3 will be the shipboard installation and demonstration of the product and the evaluation of the pricing proposal. The Technical Proposal shall address all the minimum salient characteristics.  The Government will not assume that the offeror possesses any capability unless it is specified in the proposal. Proposals should include Past Performance Information from three sources to include: 1.) Agency name; 2.) Agency point of contact and telephone number; 3.) Contract number; 4.) Type and number of units provided; and 5.) Delivery and Performance Information (Contract delivery schedules and actual delivery schedules.) 6.) Quality (Total number of units submitted for inspection and total number rejected.)  Proposals should include Pricing on the following items: 1.) Ceiling mounted medical examination light and 2.) Complete installation to make unit fully operational.  Information on the existing mount can be requested via email to Wendy Graybill at wlgraybill@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Pricing proposals shall include copies of published commercial price lists, or other documentation setting forth the prices charged to the general public for same or similar items. The Government will make award to the responsible offeror submitting the proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on an evaluation of the technical and price proposals submitted by each offeror and the shipboard installation and demonstration.  The technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than cost.  In the event that two or more technical proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences, the award may be made to the lower price proposal.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the low offeror.  Award may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions.  Therefore, offerors are cautioned that each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms.  Failure to submit any information requested would result in a determination that the technical or pricing proposal is incomplete and the offeror may not be considered further for award. Technical evaluation will be done in two stages.  Each offer must document compliances in Stage 1 before proceeding to Stage 2. Offerors providing acceptable results from Stage 2 will proceed to Stage 3. 
    
Stage 1: The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below. Salient characteristics will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  The requirement is for a ceiling mounted medical examination light that has the following essential minimum salient characteristics: 1.) Shall be a ceiling mounted medical examination light; 2.) Shall have a minimum 150 degrees of rotation about the extension arm; 3.) Shall have a minimum of 60 degrees of rotation about the yoke; 4.) Shall have a minimum of 90 degrees of rotation about the vertical support of the lighthead; 5.) The light color shall be within 15% of 4500 degrees Kelvin; 6.) Shall have a minimum illuminance of 50,000 Lux; 7.) The focal range shall start at a minimum of 24 inches and not extend past 50 inches from the lighthead; 8.) The lighthead shall not cause a temperature rise of more than 4oC; 9.) The lighthead shall have a minimum rating of 500 hours on the light source; 10.) Ship’s power will be supplied to the product at 120 VAC. In addition to the above mentioned essential characteristics, the proposal shall state that the ceiling mounted medical examination light shall be capable of passing the following tests: 1.) High Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 2.) High Temperature (Storage) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF for 24 hours.  The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 3.) Low Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 40oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 4.) Low Temperature (Storage) -The test items will be placed in the chamber at -60oF for 24 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 5.) Humidity - Temperature will be set to 120oF and humidity was set to 90%.  The test items will be placed in the chamber for 8 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; and 6.) Vibration - The test items will be placed on a single axis vibration table.  The test items will be exposed to the MIL-STD 810E, Method 514.4 vibration signature (copies available) for 30 minutes.  This vibration profile is a composite of what the military believes the equipment will be subjected to.  They will be removed from the table and operated to determine if they function.

Stage 2 will consist of a comparative evaluation of past performance information encompassing subfactors 1) Similar Work, 2) Delivery and 3) Quality and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. 

Stage 3: The offerors who provide acceptable proposals based on criteria above will be requested to demonstrate their products on 29 Jan 04 at the Naval Sea Systems Command in Norfolk, VA. at no expense to the Government.  Demonstration shall consist of the following parameters: 1.) Offerors will be limited to three personnel to represent their company; 2.) The Offerors will be given one hour to demonstrate their products. The demonstration will be used to evaluate the time and tools needed to install and make the light operational within a shipboard environment and meet minimum requirements in Stage 1 (items 1-10). Offerors will be further evaluated in the area of pricing. Pricing proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors, Completeness, Reasonableness and Realism. 

A determination of award will then be made to the offeror who has demonstrated a product that represents the best value to the Government. After award the contractor will provide a sample of their medical examination light for acceptance testing. The Government will test the sample to determine compliance with all the characteristics listed in Stage 1 of this solicitation for survival within the shipboard environment.  Samples shall be 1.) Submitted at no expense to the Government; and 2.) Returned at the Contractors request and expense, which may be damaged during testing. Failure to meet the acceptance testing will result in a Termination of the contract and subsequent award to the next ranked vendor.

Questions received for Solicitation Number N62645-04-R-0003, Ceiling Mounted Medical Examination Lights

1) Are the lights to be used strictly as Exam Lights?
Yes.

2) Are there existing support structures installed in the ships to which the lights are to be attached, and if so, are the supports identical from ship to ship? Also we need complete details on the support structures (including dimensions), in addition to the adapter plate detail received.
The support structure is different for each ship and different for each space.  The adapter plate will allow interface with the base plate of any one of the mounts.  I have drawings of the more than 20 different support structures.  They vary in length and angle, this should only change the amount of wiring needed to complete the install.

3) The following dimensional information is required:
· The total interstitial space dimension between the finished ceiling and the structural ceiling above it.
· The dimension from the bottom of the existing support structure and the finished ceiling. 
· The dimension of floor to finished ceiling.
· A detail of any obstructions connected to the ceiling which could interfere with the operation and movement of the lights.

<DESC>This is an amendment to synopsis announcement N6339403R4009 posted 12 Sep 2003.  The purpose of this amendment is to explain the event-based security qualification procedure contained in the original synopsis announcement and in the solicitation, define security sponsorship and to invoke a time limit for submission of security information. The solicitation invokes an event-based security qualification procedure where offeror's security qualifications are evaluated at three points to ensure unqualified offerors do not receive access to classified material (the SOW) and only offerors immediately ready to commence contract performance are eligible for award.  The three-phased events are: (1) qualification (clearance and need-to-know) to receive the SOW, (2) qualification at time of proposal submission and (3) qualification at time of award.  Qualification for phase (1) was specif ied in the pre-solicitation announcement.  Qualification for phases (2) and (3) is contained in the solicitation. A "sanitized" version of the SOW will not be provided because of (a) the cost of providing various matrixes of documents that may be requested, (b) offerors not receiving the entire SOW will not be responsive and (c) the event based qualification procedure specifies higher standards than the SOW classification level.  Qualified small businesses may request and receive the SOW.  The acquisition remains a small business set-aside. For offerors who are cleared to receive the SOW, the following security documents will be provided: (1) A DD254 Contract Security Specification authorizing possession of the classified SOW and production of a classified proposal not to exceed the SECRET/NOFORN level and (2)  an additional DD254 authorizing higher-level submission upon  request and satisfaction of supplementary security requirements.  Sponsorship will not be provided for new or upgraded facility clearances. TIME LIMIT FOR SUBMISSION OF SECURITY INFORMATION:  To be eligible to receive the classified SOW, offerors must meet the security requirements and provide the required data. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: (A) have a Defense Security Service (DSS) issued facility clearance providing for TOP SECRET personnel clearances and SECRET safeguarding. Such facility clearance must be unrestricted, that is not be under a special security agreement or have any restrictions on access to TOP SECRET, communication security services, cryptographic materials and equipment, Restricted Data or Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and; (B) have an appointed Contractor Special Security Officer (CSSO).  REQUIRED DATA: (1) Cage Code (2) Legal Name, Known Name (if  different) (3) Physical Address (4) Level of Clearance (personnel clearances authorized must be TOP SECRET (5) Storage/Safeguarding Level (must be SECRET or above) (6) Status of Clearance (must be active) (7) Facility Security Officer name/phone (8) Classified Mailing Address (9) Cognizant DSS Office location (10) DSS Industrial Security Representative name/phone and (11) a copy of the CSSO designation letter.  If the designation letter is not government issued, the offeror must also include objective evidence of the source of government authority to make such a designation.  All multiple locations require separate submissions for the facility to which the SOW shall be sent.  Offerors are cautioned that this information will be verified with the DSS Central Verification Activity (CVA) located at www.dss.mil and any inaccuracies may result in a determination of not qualified to  receive the SOW. The above information shall be sent via mail or other carrier to: Special Security Representative (SSR), Naval Surface Warfare Center, 160 Rochester Dr, Louisville, KY 40214-2685 and MUST BE RECEIVED by the SSR on or before close of business, 4:00 pm EST, 28 Jan 2004.  Failure to furnish accurate and complete information will result in the offeror being ineligible to receive the classified SOW and will render the offeror ineligible to receive contract award.

These services include all tasks related to the software testing of all SCI community intelligence applications and tools intended for operational use. This procurement may consolidate a number of existing IT test support contracts and provide for additional services not included in existing contracts. The systems to be supported by this contract are located in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area and throughout the Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems Community. The successful service provider must be able to provide local, CONUS, and global systems testing services with a high level of expertise and responsiveness.  A U.S. security clearance is a condition of employment.  Contractor personnel shall be required to be United States citizens that possess  Top Secret, Sensitive, Compartmented Intelligence (TS/SCI) clearances and have successfully completed a CI polygraph.    Contractors must be able to administer classified contracts. This procurement will include tasks necessary to provide the complete range of system testing (integration, installation, infrastructure compliance, operational) services for all DoDIIS SCI intelligence application/tools.  Deliverables will include data in the form of detailed test reports, deployment recommendations, test schedules, test finding justification, configuration management, presentation materials (overheads, briefing aids, etc.), reference guides, revisions to existing Government documents and Interface Control Documents (ICD), white papers, program plans and other general material as required (analysis, plans, schedules).  Responsiveness and timeliness are critical factors for these tasks.  While the majority  of work is accomplished during regular duty hours (7:00am -  5:00pm, M-F), DIA operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.  It is feasible that mission needs may require personnel to work outside of the regular duty hours to facilitate a critical need on an infrequent basis. Successful contractors must be able to provide thorough testing IAW DoDIIS technical standards of approximately 50 tests annually, across multiple operating systems and widely diverse technologies from GOTS and COTS, client server, thick client to thin client and web plug-ins. In addition, contractors must be able to coordinate testing amongst widely dispersed organizations with an extensive inventory of multi-vendor systems.  Contractors must be thoroughly familiar with Department of Defense (DoD) Intelligence Information Systems.  Services that may be required include, but are not limited to, the following: support to joint test planning meetings, Pre-test software evaluations, test plan development and coordination, test scheduling,  integration, installation, infrastructure and operational testing, detailed test report generation, findings management, test bed and software configuration management, statistics management, briefing generation and presentation for multi-vendor, diverse technology systems, system upgrades and enhancements.  DIA requires a contractor support cadre of highly skilled systems testers, analysts, engineers, and application specialists to handle a myriad of issues related to the architecture, integration implementation and operation of a complex and diverse set of systems and networks.  Such personnel need to be experts and certified in the Microsoft NT and Solaris/Trusted Solaris operating systems.  Applications to be supported include a variety of databases, Microsoft Office products, Netscape, Lotus Domino/Notes, and many other GOTS and COTS products.  In view of the special security requirements for this program, the successful vendor will have developed and put into practice a process to handle all aspects o of classified contracting.  This includes support in contract administration and pricing. The successful vendor must be able to demonstrate the process by which classified contracts are handled to provide services.  Cleared and experienced individuals must be trained and in place prior to any contract awards to carry out this process in various departments within the vendor's organization. Submissions should be limited to five pages and should be pertinent and specific to the technical areas under consideration for this procurement.  Submissions should include the following qualifications:  (1) Experience - an outline of previous applicable projects and specific work previously performed or being performed;  (2) Personnel - name, professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel who will provide the services listed above.  Knowledge gained through training may be considered.  Include any other specific and pertinent information pertaining to this proposed procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Vendors interested in participating in this Sources Sought announcement are requested to contact Ms. Kara Byrd (202) 231-4419 at the Defense Intelligence Agency; Attn: DS-CIO LCM; Bldg. 6000; Bolling AFB; Washington, D.C.  20340-5100 no later than January 7, 2004, or sooner if possible, to be included in the above planned meeting.

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
Q.  Estimated number of passengers to accommodate? 
A.  Each vendor accepted into a BPA will be reviewed for transportation capability; therefore passenger load requests will be in line with those capabilities.  Our goal is to establish BPA's with as many vendors as is necessary to ensure that we have enough transportation assets at our 
disposal to both shuttle and motor coach up 3500 passengers per day. 
Q.  Vehicle type for passengers? 
A.  We require that vendors have at least one of the following assets: motor coaches; shuttle busses; or executive sedans.  All vehicles should be in excellent condition and of recent make.  Drivers should be experienced with all local routes and properly licensed. 
Q.  Duration of Event and requirement for services? 
A.  There are two principle periods for transportation needs: the month of February and the first two weeks of June.  In February, transportation requirements are for 1 motor coach and 2 executive sedans (with drivers) for each group that is visiting the Savannah area.  These trips will be 3 days long and will require an overnight for drivers on the second night.  There will be 10 of these trips in February and 1st week of March.  The actual Summit event (first two weeks of June) will provide for the bulk of our transportation needs.  Vendors will be brought together to help develop, operate, and maintain the necessary shuttle and motor coach routes we expect 
to have in place.  At this time, we cannot be explicit with vehicle requirements, but primary routes will be within Savannah and from Savannah to the Golden Isles area. 
Q.  Rates? 
A.  Commercial rate sheets are all we require.  We will use these rates as our basis for negotiating actual service rates once we know what the requirement is (i.e. - our request for transportation assets may enable us to receive a volume discount). Our primary contracting will make use of a day rate, but there will be the occasional need for an hourly rate.  Both should be reflected on the rate sheet for all vehicles available.

<DESC>As part of market research, The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for exploring the option of re-engineering U.S. Air Force Studies and Analysis Squadron (SAS). The goal of this effort is to determine the possibility of a commercial agency absorbing the AETC SAS mission through streamlined competition. If savings are demonstrated, the feasibility of a commercial agency assuming this responsibility through contract award is contemplated.                 

This RFI is an attempt to locate businesses EXPERIENCED in formal studies and analytical efforts capable of providing valued analysis information to senior leadership. This RFI is not to be construed as a formal solicitation nor does it constitute a current or any future Government requirement. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. The Air Force is only interested at this point in determining industry capability for the contemplated services. To this end, private sector industry is invited to submit experience, capability and cost information demonstrating the ability to meet the requirements below.  Request responses be provided NLT 30 Jan 04             

Period of Performance:  TBD 

Requirement:  

Air Education and Training Command
Studies and Analysis Squadron (SAS)
Service Summary

The AETC SAS Squadron individually tailors studies for the AETC Commander and unit project officers.  The AETC SAS services enable AETC leadership to make fact-based decisions on pressing AETC issues impacting the Air Force training and education environment.  AETC SAS has three separate functions, the Command POC operational test and evaluation of new and improved weapon systems, the commands think-tank, and evaluates new technology for application to education and training.
                                                                 
The Studies and Analysis Squadron is organized into three flights.  Command Studies Flight is composed of a team of Air Force Scientist holding advance degrees in Operations Research, who answer General Officer level questions pertaining to Flying Training, Technical Training, and Professional Military Education.  Studies range from quick turn (a few hours) to multi-year efforts. Example of a multi-year effort is developing a capability model for enlisted initial skills training that 
fully captures resource and readiness impacts.  An example of a quick turn study would be answering a congressional inquiry into does AETC treat minorities fairly.  Study outcomes are typically briefed to General Officers and presented at research conferences.
The Test and Evaluation (TE) flight-tests AETC aircrew training systems and communications and computer systems.  The TE Flight conducts test and test-related studies for new and modified AETC aircrew training and information management systems.  The Technology Innovation (TI) flight acts as a quasi-battle-lab for AETC determining the effectiveness and return on investment of new concepts and off-the-shelf technology in education and training.  The TI services require analysts with diverse backgrounds: space operations, communications, computer science, maintenance, and engineering; this provides TI analyst a unique perspective to bear upon a wide range of technology projects spanning many Air Force specialties.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A  SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS only.  The purpose of the Sources Sought Synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources for Design Excellence in public Architectural-Engineering  for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Phase services for the John Minor Wisdom U. S. Court of Appeals Building in New Orleans, Louisiana.  The John Minor Wisdom building is located at 600 Camp Street in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana. It was completed in 1915 as the city’s main post office and Federal courthouse. It served the public with these functions for almost 50 years. Since 1972 the Fifth Circuit U.S Court of Appeals has occupied the building. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The three-story building provides 246,280 gross square feet for approximately 172 employees. Parking is provided in the basement for 50 vehicles.  GSA proposes to replace vital building systems that have exceeded their life expectancy and are critical to the safe and efficient operation of the building. Modifications to the electrical system will include replacement of transformers and panel boards. Upgrades to the mechanical components of the HVAC system include replacement of air handling units, rezoning ductwork, reworking of HVAC controls, and pipe and duct asbestos abatement. Plumbing system modifications include replacement of fixtures and the domestic water system. Architectural work will include renewing corridor and stair finishes, renovating toilet rooms, and providing handicapped signage, telephones, and drinking fountains.   GSA Greater Southwest Region, Solicitation No. GS-07P-04-UUC-1003. The Estimated Construction Cost range is between $5 to $10 million dollars.  Designed by the distinguished New York architectural firm of Hale and Rogers, the Wisdom Court of Appeals Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.  It is an imposing, monumental structure, one of the most significant in New Orleans.  The building occupies an entire city block; its white marble exterior is a well proportioned example of Italian Renaissance revival architecture.  Each of the building’s four corners is treated architecturally as a pavilion, including a large distinctive sculpture group at the top, known as the “Ladies”.  The unique aspects of the architecture of this period should be considered. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS). The design shall include sustainable features. The design shall also include the GSA design standards for secure facilities. The building will be completely occupied during the construction phase. Therefore the design shall be phased so that the tenants can complete their mission without interruption. In developing the project team, the A/E Firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the State of Louisiana. The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants.  Interested A/E firms must have performed on at least four to six similar repair and alteration projects, two of which include treatment of historic issues, completed within the past 10 years and a minimum of three projects must be multi-story buildings (minimum of 3 stories) with a total construction cost exceeding $5 million. The design work for the projects described by responding firms shall have scopes which clearly demonstrate competence in engineering design for office spaces, and mechanical, electrical, and architectural handicap accessibility design similar in scope to that identified for the Wisdom Court of Appeals Building.  Interested parties who meet the above requirements are requested to submit a one-page letter of interest to Pamela Lackey, Contracting Officer, no later than  January 21, 2004.  Letters can be submitted via email to pam.lackey@gsa.gov or by facsimile to (817) 978-7194.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI) National Business Center (NBC) has a requirement for enhancements to its Federal Command Center (FCC) service, which is a proprietary product of Meta Secur E-Com Solutions.  FCC is a unique, cost effective IT Security program management service.  FCC's single, integrated portal provides tools, a comprehensive security knowledge base, and reporting features for addressing federal regulations, implementing NIST standards, and managing OMB and Inspector General reporting mandates.  FCC combines Policy and Awareness management, Vulnerability and Patch Management, enterprise system security assessment and POA&MS tracking with workflow and reporting.  FCC automates security policy and awareness management and includes a comprehensive Federal Security Policy framework and features for creating, managing, deployment and tracking policies.  The system is integrated with multiple third party system compliance checking tools for closed-loop policy management.   FCC automates multi-platform vulnerability alerting, tracking, and patch management.  The current requirement includes enhancements for the automation of POA&MS Tracking and Milestone Tracking.  Optional line items include FCC Program Management Support, FCC & Symantec Integration Proof of Concept, and Implementation of DOI Hosted Command Center.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 USC 253(c)(1), implemented by (FAR) Part 6.302-1, the Government considers the enhancements to the FCC service as a sole source from Meta Secur E-Com Solutions, 20464 Chartwell Center Dr., Cornelius, NC  28031-9629 and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response within 7 days of the date of this announcement.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

<CONTACT>Jamiel Charlton Commodore, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 286-5451, Fax (301) 286-0357, Email Jamiel.C.Commodore@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA Headquarters is hereby soliciting information about potential 8(a) sources to support processing of research proposals submitted in response to Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued by the NASA Offices of Education (Code N), Space Science (Code S), Biological and Physical Research (Code U), Earth Science (Code Y), Space Flight (Code M), and Aerospace Technology (Code R).	Interested, certified 8(a) small businesses and non-8(a) small businesses which meet the size standard provided below and qualify for the 8(a) program are requested to provide their name, location, size, and detailed information demonstrating their technical understanding of the work requirements identified below, as well as their qualifications, capabilities, experience, and past performance history for such work.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  It is anticipated that an Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ), Cost type contract will be issued for a five-year period of performance with a total contract value in excess of $50 million.  The anticipated award date is November 2004.  The NAICS code for this action is 561110 and the size standard is $6 million.  A brief description of NASA’s BAA application requirements and process are as follows: the contractor shall manage, be responsible for, and provide database support to all organizational components of NASA Headquarters in support of soliciting research proposals and receiving, processing, and evaluating responses to the solicitations from the science community.  A significant component of this process is peer review of research proposals by panels of specialists and experts.  NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Supplement 1835.016 and 1872.403 dictate that peer review will be the method used to evaluate and select research for funding.  NASA funds intramural and extramural research primarily through solicited grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and arrangements with other Government agencies, industry and academia.  Solicitation mechanisms used are primarily the NASA Research Announcement (NRA), the Announcement of Opportunity (AO), and the Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN).  Proposals submitted in response to these solicitations are evaluated using peer review, which is defined as scientific evaluation by a specialist of proposals submitted in response to NRA’s, AO’s, and CAN’s.  Peer review is also used to evaluate unsolicited proposals.  Peer Reviewers evaluate relevance to NASA’s objectives; intrinsic scientific and/or technical merit, including the researcher’s capabilities and qualifications; and cost.  External peer review is essential to ensure that NASA funds only the most relevant and highest quality research.  Policies for peer review are documented through the instructions in the solicitations which are written by NASA scientists, managers, or executives.  Specific peer review methods differ somewhat among NASA offices or disciplines.  Some NASA program offices use peer review committees, some use ad hoc committees, and some use a combination for each individual announcement.  Peer reviewers include qualified scientists, engineers, and/or other appropriate personnel from public and private academic institutions, industry, Government laboratories and agencies, and foreign countries.  NASA and the support contractor maintain databases of discipline experts to help identify appropriate candidates.  Reviews are conducted by mail and/or by panel meetings, depending on the logistics specific to the review.  Mail reviews may be conducted to allow for the use of reviewers with very specialized expertise on technical and scientific issues.  Often a panel review is used to reconcile differences among mail reviews, and also to advise NASA on the larger scientific and programmatic context of the proposed research.	The peer review contractor must be capable of maintaining a highly dependable World Wide Web (WWW) site for electronic receipt of Notices of Intent to propose and then the final cover page and proposal summary of the actual proposals.	The number of such electronic submissions ranges from a few dozens to several hundred, depending on the scope of the solicitation.  The contractor is expected to produce logs sorted by a wide variety of data fields based on these electronic submissions and supply them to NASA within a few days of the submission deadline.  The contractor shall assist NASA in screening each incoming proposal to determine compliance with eligibility criteria and consistency with general program solicitation requirements. The contractor shall be responsible for the receipt and secure storage of proposals received (as many as 500 at a time in order to accommodate the submissions to multiple solicitations) and shall also be responsible for accurately assembling packages of proposals to be sent to the designated mail and panel reviewers, in advance of the peer review activity itself.  Some NASA offices require the contractor to determine the identity of these reviewers; in other cases, NASA personnel will identify them.  Each panel typically consists of 7 to 10 members, and it is common to have as many as six panels meeting simultaneously to review all the proposals submitted in response to a single solicitation (as many as 150).  Panels typically meet for three days, requiring the panel members to be resident for up to four nights.  The solicitation of panel members may be done by phone or letter, which may be the responsibility of the support contractor.  The contractor makes transportation and lodging arrangements for the panelists and ensures that panel members are appropriately and promptly reimbursed for their travel costs to attend panel meetings, based on travel reimbursement guidelines established by NASA.  As necessary, the contractor arranges for securing conference space for the panel review at commercial or NASA facilities.  The contractor is responsible for receiving and collating all mail reviews transmitted in advance of the meeting, and for real-time support of the panel meeting itself, including near real-time word processing support to document the reviews that are produced by the panel.  After the panel has finished its deliberations, the contractor shall be responsible for cleaning up all paperwork and for returning the proposals to secure storage.  The contractor will also support activities ancillary to soliciting research proposals, such as workshops and conferences convened to formulate long-range science research objectives, and education/outreach initiatives that provide opportunities for participating in NASA’s research programs to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges.  In order to demonstrate the capability of responding to NASA’s requirement for processing research proposals and managing peer reviews, potential 8(a) small business offerors should provide detailed information to show evidence of possessing the following attributes and characteristics necessary for providing the required support: (1) the ability to work with a variety of groups, which includes the ability to manage teams of peer review personnel and multiple, simultaneous review panels; (2) availability of key personnel with project management experience for activities with multiple sub projects/tasks; (3) the ability to manage and coordinate the associated proposal receipt and storage, meeting logistics support, travel, scheduling, etc. that are diverse and frequently simultaneous; (4) experience in database management, modification, and maintenance, in a secure network environment; (5) an acceptable or approved accounting system for Government cost-reimbursable contracts; (6) availability of financial resources to provide the required support; and (7) satisfactory work performance as evidenced by providing the names, addresses, and phone numbers of three references for whom the potential offeror has provided peer review or similar type services during the past three years. Responses must be in writing and may be submitted electronically. All responses shall be submitted no later than February 16, 2004, at 3:00 p.m. local time to NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 210.H, Attn: Jamiel C. Commodore, Greenbelt MD 20771 or by email Jamiel.C.Commodore@nasa.gov.  Questions about this synopsis may be sent by email.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. The expected release time frame for any RFP is the second quarter of Fiscal 2004.  This Sources Sought Notice/Request for Interest is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URL:  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nnotes.htm.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes."  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. Description NASA/GSFC is soliciting comments on requirements established for a space-qualified Single Board Computer (SBC) in support of the Solar Dynamic Observeratory (SDO) and the Global Precipitation Monitor (GPM) programs.  The present requirements are specified in the following attached documents: Performance Specification, Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project 464-CDH-SPEC-0012,(Exhibit 1),	Statement of Work (SOW) for Solar Observatory (SDO) Project, Command and Data Handling (C&DH), Single Board Computer (SBC), 464-CDH-LEGL-0008 (Exhibit 2), and the Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS) for Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project (Exhibit 3).  Deliverable hardware will comprise three categories defined as Breadboard Units (BBU), Engineering Test Units (ETU), and Flight Units (FU) with the following quantities and delivery dates:	BASIC EFFORT: BBU - Qty =6 ea, Delivery Due 8 wks after contract award, ETU - Qty = 1 ea, Delivery Due 26 wks after contract award, FU - Qty = 3 ea, Delivery Due 52 wks after contract award; OPTIONAL EFFORT: (Option 1) ETU - Qty =2 ea, Delivery Due 26 wks after option exercise, (Option 2) FU - Qty = 3 ea, Delivery Due 52 wks after option exercise, and (Option 3) FU - Qty = 2 ea, Delivery Due 52 wks after contract award.   This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a draft Statement of Work, Specification, Deliverable Items List and Schedule via the internet, and solicit input and recommendations from interested parties that will be considered for the subsequent Request for Proposal.  NASA previously solicited proposals for this requirement using the NASA Mid-Range Acquisition Procedures in accordance with NASA FAR Supplement 1871.  The Government has cancelled this previous solicitation and is now contemplating a new solicitation which will follow the procedures of FAR Part 15, with Mission Suitability evaluation criteria.   The objective of this RFI is to gather information for a subsequent SBC Request for Proposal (RFP) that promotes competition by improving NASA/GSFC's knowledge of industry's capabilities in the area of commercially available space-qualified single board computers.  NASA/GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that will be used to determine eligibility to be participants in one-on-one discussions.  This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of the discussions is to provide a dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA/GSFC's requirements and its acquisition approach.  The compilation of submitted information and discussion results from all viable participants will be factored along with SDO and GPM requirements to refine the aforementioned Performance Specification (Exhibit 1), SOW (Exhibit 2), and DILS (Exhibit 3) that will then be incorporated into a new RFP that will be posted for all interested offerors.   In order to be considered for eligibility as participants in discussions, potential offerors must submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: 1.  Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification, SOW, and DILS.  Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comments that either describe how a potential offeror's SBC could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror's position on such a requirement.  This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one discussions. 2.  Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule. 3.  Summary of past relevant experience in developing space-qualified electronics hardware. PLEASE NOTE THAT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THE SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS NO. SDO-04562-GFH ISSUED ON JULY 7, 2003 FOR RFO NO. 03-GFH-001 WILL BE INCLUDED FOR CONSIDERATION AND EVALUATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO Command and Data Handling Single Board Computer procurement that will be furnished at this time.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements to: Kathleen Tennant, Mail Code 464, NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, MD 20771, no later than January 28, 2004.  Comments may be forwarded to Kathleen Tennant via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission.  When responding reference RFI-SDO-GFH-001. This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the final results from the one-on-one discussions. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>This is a Market Research, Sources Sought synopsis seeking potential offerors capable of providing an evaluation of natural language processing techniques for the intelligence community.  The natural language processing techniques revolve around the evaluation of search systems and summarization systems. Search systems are systems such as Google that take a short statement in English of what is wanted and return pointers to documents that most likely contain that information. Summarization systems produce short synopses of a set of related documents. The evaluation of search systems is performed within a series of workshops known as TREC (Text REtrieval Conference); summarization is evaluated in DUC (Document Understanding Conference).  Both conferences are held after the conclusion of the Contractor’s research. More details about TREC and DUC are given on the NIST web site at http://trec.nist.gov and http://duc.nist.gov.  Since the intelligence community (the Department of Defense, National Security Administration, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency and others) is the target user for the systems ONLY potential offerors with experience in intelligence analysis (i.e. people who have worked for these agencies gathering intelligence by examining large amounts of data from various sources) shall provide a response. This experience must be clearly shown and supported in the capability statement.  The government estimates that the total number of man hours to complete this requirement for the Base Year will be approximately 7,300 hours performed on a sporadic basis between March 2004 and October 2004.  The man hours are expected to be the same for each option year, and will also be performed on a sporadic basis. Because humans react to the data and task differently, it is critical to the integrity of the evaluation process that the test materials be created by a wide sample of potential users of the technology.  Therefore, the Government requires a minimum of 30 different test samples (i.e. from 30 different people).  The following is only an overview of the tasks required to complete the Government’s requirement for TREC research: develop 10-20 test questions (called topics) for the TREC testing cycle, read a pooled list of about 2,000 documents determining relevancy to the topic, search the TREC collections for answers to a set of questions, determine if answers to questions are appropriate.  The following is only an overview of the tasks required to complete the Government's requirement for DUC research:  from twenty-five clusters of documents (each cluster will contain on average 10 documents ranging in size from 10 sentences to 10 pages of singled-spaced text), create a very short summary (<= 75 bytes) of each document and from each cluster a short summary (<= 665 bytes).  Additionally, select document clusters based on a question, each cluster shall contain on average 10 documents. From each of these ten documents, create a very short summary (<= 75 bytes) of each document and from each cluster a short summary (<= 665 bytes).  Examine the output returned from the participating research groups systems and compare them to the contractor created summaries (very short and short summaries).  Interested firms shall provide the Government with (1) Name of Company-include a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address; (2) Company Address; (3) Size Business; (4) Identify whether the services identified above are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices and whether these services are exclusively provided to the Government; (5) Identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these services; (6) Describe experience and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude and whether they were performance-based - include the contract number; Government agency name and address; contract funded amount; (7) Identify existing or potential pricing structure in support of this type of work; and (8) Identify qualifications of technical and management personnel. ***** THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. ***** Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set-aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are an 8(a) firm, small business (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, disadvantaged, women-owned, other small businesses) or large business.  Firms interested in performing this requirement must reply to this RFI by January 21, 2004 addressing the elements above and any processes that would be used. Replies may be electronic to anita.tolliver@nist.gov or by fax to the attention of Anita Tolliver to fax number (301) 975-8884. There is a page limit of 50 for the capability statement.  Proprietary processes or data must be clearly marked and documented as such.  Respondents should include your firms Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Central Contractor Register Number (CCR).

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of vendors that can provide training and data management support to the Federal Occupational Health Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Program. Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in the United States, resulting in nearly 1 million deaths a year.  Nearly half of these deaths are sudden and unexpected.  Most sudden deaths from cardiac arrest occur outside the hospital, and survival rates have traditionally been poor:  only 1% to 5% of these patients are estimated to survive to hospital discharge.  Most persons experiencing cardiac arrest have no history of severe heart disease, and sudden cardiac death is frequently the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease.  This has led to a concerted effort to improve pre-hospital care to decrease the mortality associated with sudden cardiac arrest. In order to meet this goal, the American Heart Association (AHA) promoted the “Chain of Survival” concept, describing a sequence of interventions or links that, when implemented, results in significantly improved survival from sudden cardiac arrest.  Early defibrillation has emerged as the single most important intervention.  There is data from animal and human studies showing that defibrillation, delivered immediately after witnessed ventricular fibrillation, results in survival rates greater than 90%.  Each delay of one minute of defibrillation results in an additional 10% reduction in survival.  Chances of long-term survival of patients defibrillated after 10 minutes are dismal, even with adequate CPR. In an effort to overcome these limitations, the AHA has recently promoted the concept of Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) programs.  This concept promotes the expansion of the role of defibrillation to minimally trained first-responders.  It places automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in such public areas as airports, malls and large office buildings. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) was directed by the President of the United States and by Congress to write guidelines for Public Access Defibrillation Programs in Federal buildings.  These guidelines were published on May 23, 2001.  The guidelines outline all the elements that should be included in a comprehensive program, and emphasizes that the keys to a successful AED program in the workplace are adequate training and a short response time. Federal Occupational Health (FOH) has been the leader in establishing AED programs in the Federal government.  FOH has developed protocols in complete compliance with the HHS Guidelines and installed hundreds of AEDs in over 100 Federal facilities in the last year alone.  The leadership of the FOH AED Program unequivocally supports the development and implementation of a properly planned AED program.   The FOH AED Team resides in Denver, Colorado.  Providing initial and ongoing training by a nationally recognized agency is a critical element in protecting AED lay responders against liability.  Good Samaritan laws vary from state to state on emergency medical care including defibrillation.  FOH follows current HHS guidelines in relation to the training of AED lay responders. The AED Program is national in scope. The FOH AED Program currently has over 7,000 trained lay responders throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.  The training being sought must utilize the standards set by the American Heart Association, American Red Cross, the American Safety and Health Institute or the National Safety Council.  The vendor shall provide the FOH AED Program with a user-friendly basic electronic data management service that will enable the FOH AED Program Staff to track initial and re-certification AED training data.  This database will be used for medical oversight and quality assurance including day-to-day administration of certain aspects of the FOH AED Program.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690. THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), OR REQUEST FOR APPLICATION (RFA) AND IN NO WAY OBLIGATES THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD THE CONTRACT.  The minimum requirements are as follows: 1) Provide a central contact for the FOH AED Program Staff.  This central contact will also be the contact for the agencies requesting training, 2) Provide trainers who are certified as instructors for the AHA, the ARC, the ASHI or the NSC, 3) Provide supplemental occupational health classes at FOH’s request.  Classes will include:  (a) standard first aid classes; (b) bloodborne pathogens training; 4) Provide training on any type of AED machine by various manufacturers, to include but not be limited to Philips Medical Systems, Medtronics / Physio-Control, Cardiac Science, Welch-Allyn (Medical Research Laboratories), Zoll and Access Cardio Systems.  The FOH AED Program Staff will specify the type of AED machine being utilized by an agency, 5) Schedule classes within a four (4) week period from the time of notification from the FOH AED Program staff unless permission in writing is obtained, 6) Provide all materials necessary for the classes including but not limited to, the AED trainer units and manikins as well as appropriate accessories, 7) Provide the appropriate course card to each class participant at the completion of the course stating that the course was successfully completed.  The course cards shall bear the nationally recognized service mark indicating the student successfully completed the course, 8) Track all courses and students trained and have the ability to view course history by location, department, date of class, number of students in the class, class roster and course completion, 9) Review all AED training history for FOH sites and other federal agencies by location and department.  The training history will include the location of the training, the department (if applicable) within the agency, the time frame, class title and course completion, 10) Display all training information by individual first responder (employee / student).  This includes recording individual first responder successful or unsuccessful completion of initial AED / CPR training and subsequent required re-certification training(s).  The vendor shall provide notification of first responder (employee / student) noncompliance with training and re-certification to the FOH AED Program Staff, the AED Site Coordinator and the first responder (employee / student), 11) Record results of the agency’s internal quarterly / periodic refresher training(s) and mock cardiac arrest drills within the database.  The vendor shall enable the FOH AED Program Staff the ability to input data from remote locations, 12) Make data available for reporting and monitoring by a hierarchy of access established by the FOH AED Program Staff, 13) Include but not be limited to the following data: Agency name, National agency location, Local agency site location, Local agency’s AED Site Coordinator name and work phone number, Agency program representative’s name and work phone number, Names of the agency’s AED Responders and work phone numbers, Date of successful or unsuccessful completion of the CPR / AED certification of each AED Responder (employee / student), Anticipated renewal date for each AED Responder (employee / student) CPR / AED certification, 14) The database shall be available to the AED Program Staff via electronic media.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS ISSUED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY! THIS IS NOT A SOLICIATION! The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever AFB Colorado is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to gather information from industry. The Security Forces at Schriever AFB will be operating a Secure Area Logistics Center (SALC) to screen all incoming packages, including but not limited to mail, parcels, pallets, large vehicles, and bulk deliveries, to Schriever AFB. In order to perform this function the Government is looking into equipment that can perform these functions. The equipment should be able to provide an operator with the ability to screen items from mail to tractor/trailer vehicles, screen items for biological and chemical contamination, screen items for explosives, deliver a three dimensional, three hundred and sixty degree (3D, 360 degree) view of the items with in a container. All items involved will require computerized tracking through the receiving, screening, processing and holding. The Government will provide a 70 foot by 80 foot (approximate interior dimension) building for the equipment to be used and the inspections at the SALC. The SALC will have a tractor-trailers lane on the exterior of the building which will allow for a mobile screening system. This system needs to be a BACK SKADDER system, and not the NUCLEAR type. In edition to the equipment the Government is investigating the feasibility of the contractor to provide up to eight (8) personnel to operate the equipment. These people will be responsible for conducting the screening process in addition to the following duties: Receive shipments from supply and logistic personnel, operate screening equipment Monday through Friday between eight to ten hours a day, provide customer service and administrative duties as required. A minimum of four of these individuals will need to be able to, or already possess a SCI clearance. The contractor will also need to be able to provide up to fifteen additional personnel who would need to meet pre-qualification criteria for the issue of restricted are badges in order to perform escort duties, as well as installation entry identification checks. Similar systems are currently used in the Colorado Rocky Mountain region and this office can provide information as to those systems and locations upon request. In addition to systems capabilities and equipment the Government requests that all responding contractors provide capability statements on their company as well as information of where the firm has performed or provided equipment along with points of contact. All interested parties shall submit their information no later that 26 January 2004. This information can be sent via mail to 50th Contracting Squadron, Attention SSgt Craig Castleman, 210 Falcon Parkway, Ste 2116, Schriever AFB Colorado 80912-2116. Due to limited system bandwidth the Government requests that all packages be mailed and not submitted via email. If you have questions or comments you may contact SSgt Craig Castleman at 719-567-3765, via email at craig.castleman@schriever.af.mil, or SSgt Leo Lombardo at 719-567-3450, via email at leo.lombardo@schriever.af.mil .

<SUBJECT>91--REQUEST FOR LUBRICATION SAMPLES FOR SMALL ARMS WEAPONS IN A DESERT ENVIRONMENT
<SOLNBR>W911QX-04-GLD-02
<RESPDATE>012304
<ARCHDATE>03232004
<CONTACT>Gregory Davies, 410-278-6809
<DESC>The Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, has formed a multi-service team to screen and test lubricant samples for small arms weapons when used in a desert environment.  RDECOM is soliciting samples from potential sources of lubricants for small arms military weapons.  The Army will use these samples to conduct an initial screening of the lubricant, then a full performance test of those that pass the initial screening phase.  Sample lubricants should be specifically designed for sand, dust, and/or desert environments. Upon the review of initial email requests (see below), the Government will contact suppliers to provide 5 gallons of lubrication or grease products and/or 1 gallon of dry film lubrication  products to the address and code listed below.    Product samples are to be from one lot to ensure consistency. This request for samples is for screening and testing purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligat ion on the part of the Government to acquire or procure any products or services. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for samples or otherwise pay for the samples or information solicited. No entitlement to payme nt of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of any items under this request or the Government's use of such samples or information. The Government desires commercially available lubricants (COTS) as well  as any new technologies or state-of-the-art lubricants. The government desires a weapon lubricant that will improve small arms weapon performance when operating in desert environments.  The required capabilities of a desert lubricant are listed below.  Th reshold requirements are listed as (T), and Objective requirements are listed as (O).  Product must be a lubricant (T), cleaner (O), and corrosion preventer (O).  Product must be compatible with existing Army Cleaner-Lubricant-Preservative (CLP) (T) which will continue to be used as a cleaner and preservative and other approved small arms lubricants (O).  Product must effectively operate in a broad spectrum of desert environmental conditions.  The objective requirement is for the desert lubricant to provide  as good as or better lubrication in a representative desert environment than CLP in an ambient dust-free environment as measured by military standard reliable firing of 630 rounds of M865/M856 and all types of small arms ammunition.  The threshold require ment is for a minimal degradation in reliability when firing with the lubricant in a desert environment as compared to CLP firings in the ambient environment.  This threshold requirement will be quantified after the evaluation of the results of the baselin e lubricant test, which is currently ongoing.  The objective desert capability solution must provide for improved lubrication while maintaining a cleaning and corrosion prevention capability through the reliable military standard firing of 630 rounds of M8 55/M856 (O), in representative desert environments (O), and all types of ammunition (O) than CLP in a sterile and desert environment.  The product must include Soldier suitable packaging (T) and minimize additional Soldier load (T) (reference MIL-STD-290 P ackaging, Packing and Marking of petroleum products).  Soldiers must be able to apply desert lubricant on their weapons without special baths, tools, or other pre-application or post-application procedures, or a requirement to fire the weapon to make the l ubricant effective in a desert environment.  The desert lubricant shall not have any adverse affect on the health of personnel when the product is used properly.  Product must be compatible with all Soldier and equipment transportation loads, for example, compatible with MOLLE vests and Alice Soldier Load Bearing Equipment carrying/storing systems.  Desert lubrication must survive extreme hot and cold transportat ion and storage environments.   The product shall be compatible with current protective finishes and materials (metallic and non-metallic) on U.S. small arms fielded systems. The Government encourages significant participation from small business concerns and socio-economic businesses. The Government prefers that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this request. However, responses to this request that indicate that the samples or information therein are proprietary or re present confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government use only.  On or before January 23, 2004, interested suppliers are requested to send an email requesting to participate in this effort. Suppliers must als o provide, via email, information on product submissions that lists exactly what will be shipped, specific application procedures for the proposed solution, an indication of whether the solution is for lubrication only (T) or lubrication, cleaning, and cor rosion prevention (O), any additional relevant technical data, material safety data sheet(s), and any other supplemental information that may assist the Government in this process, including optimal application instructions for the product.  This initial e mail request shall be sent to the Contracting Officer at RMAC-Adelphi@arl.army.mil and must cite W911QX-04-GLD-02 in the subject line.  The Government will review the initial request and will coordinate the shipment of sample products with the individual s upplier.  The Government will also forward a brief agreement to be signed by both the Government and the supplier prior to shipment of any product samples. It is expected that product samples will be requested around January 30, 2004, but should not be sen t until the Government requests shipment. Samples shall be packed to commercial shipping standards and must cite the solicitation number on all samples.  Sample submittals should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss the product with government representatives.  All correspondence concerning this request should refer to RDECOM announcement number W911QX-04-GLD-02.  The anticipated period of performance of this effort is February 2004 to April 2 004.   The NAICS code for this request is 324191; the SIC code is 2992.   This request for sample announcement constitutes the only communication of this request.  Samples are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This action is is sued as a request for product samples for screening, testing, and evaluation. The Government will generate a summary report of the screening and testing results that will be provided to participating suppliers as consideration for providing products sample s. The announcement number is W911QX-04-GLD-02. This process is being conducted under the test procedures for commercial practices under the authority of FAR 13.5.  Suppliers are responsible for all shipping and insurance costs to the FOB point of Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  The Government will take title to the product submissions upon receipt and inspection.   (Note: samples may be subject to x-ray scanning, so su ppliers are asked to advise if any products degrade as a result of x-ray screening.) The Government is not responsible for loss or damage of product submissions and residual and late product samples will not be returned.  The Government will make separate requests for the shipment of samples products.  Suppliers will be directed to ship to Commander, US Army Aberdeen Test Center, 400 Colleran Rd, Attn: CSTE-DTC-AT-WC-M (Materials Lab B400), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005.  Each submission must cite the a nnouncement number W911QX-04-GLD-02.

<SUBJECT>A -- WALRUS (Heavy-Lift Air Vehicle) RFI and Industry Day Announcement
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) regarding heavy-lift air vehicles. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.   The Government intends to issue a formal solicitation during the third quarter of calendar year 2004.  The goal of this RFI and the subsequent Industry Day is to obtain information on innovative technological system or subsystem concepts that will enable the Government to fulfill the vision of the development of the Walrus air vehicle and to identify interest and qualification for participation in the program. The primary objective of the Walrus program is to demonstrate the feasibility and viability of a large lifting air vehicle able to transport a Unit of Action (UA) from ?Fort to Fight?.  The Walrus air vehicle(s) will be capable of inter- and intra-theater operations and will deploy the UA as a complete integrated package of personnel and equipment, ready to fight.  It is anticipated that the objective operational air vehicle will be capable of lifting 500 tons or more across intercontinental distances and will be capable of operating from unimproved landing sites.  The Walrus air vehicle will also be suitable for a range of other missions requiring large platform and long endurance/range. It is expected that the Walrus air vehicle will be based on a ?hybrid? aircraft concept that generates lift through lighter-than-air gas buoyancy, as well as aerodynamic and propulsive methods.  It is essential that the Walrus air vehicle not be constrained by the limitations of earlier airships that resulted in the military phasing out of airships in the early 1960s.  As a heavier-than-air air vehicle, the Walrus will potentially employ a suite of new technologies that contribute to it having a multi-fold improvement in military utility over earlier airship designs.  Successful integration and implementation of the following technologies and others will help accomplish the Government?s vision for WALRUS capability. These technologies include the development of a suitable air vehicle design concept (i.e. non-rigid, semi-rigid or rigid), a new structural design approach, an innovative lift and control strategy (e.g. use of vectored thrust, optimum heaviness ratio strategy, trim management, VTOL performance etc), an integrated propulsion system, a ground operating system (ground-to-air interface), a variety of on-board systems optimized to this type of air vehicle (e.g. fluid re-cycling/mass conservation), acceptable flight dynamics, a payload system, an adverse weather capability, an ability to station-keep and other unique system technologies.  Innovative and high pay-off technology approaches are expected to be necessary to achieve desired operational performance and capability. Evaluation factors for the air vehicle design concept will include speed, useful payload, vertical take-off or landing (VTOL) capability, landing site limitations, un-refueled range, ground handling and safety (e.g. crosswind operations), station keeping and adverse weather condition capabilities, operational robustness, storage and conservation needs throughout operational life, affordability, and the ?heaviness ratio? (the difference of the vehicle total mass to the mass of air displaced). The Government anticipates a two-phase program with competitive core segments that will begin developing multiple objective air vehicle concepts supported by analytic design and risk reduction technology demonstrations.  Phase I will include defining conceptual designs with consideration to enabling technologies and, conducting technology demonstrations to show feasibility where appropriate.  Other tasks include modeling operational performance and capabilities and, further refinement of CONOPs through the use of decision analysis tools and trade studies.  Through a competitive process, Phase II will involve downselection to a single source to develop the preferred objective air vehicle design including the flight testing of an Advanced Technology Demonstrator (ATD).  The ATD is envisioned to be a scaled demonstrator to reduce risk for the full scale design.  Phase II will immediately follow Phase I and start in mid FY05 and consist of detail design, fabrication, assembly, qualification and conduct flight testing. Each industry responses to this RFI may address the entire system, sub-system or can focus on solutions to individual technological challenges. Technology Responses: Technological challenges of particular interest are: minimum reliance on off-board ballast during missions (e.g. use of vacuum compensator tanks ? a.k.a. ?DARPA tanks?); propulsion systems tailored to the needs of the Walrus air vehicle; low speed maneuvering concepts; ground operating systems (ground-to-air interface); new structural materials and fabrics; ballast system concepts and other approaches to dealing with the large weight changes associated with unloading a heavy lift air vehicle, ease of loading/unloading operations; lowered skin friction aerodynamic drag; and, wind gust tolerance and controllability. System and Subsystem Responses: Companies should provide a high-level system description of a complete solution or a description of a subsystem technology that will enable or enhance the objectives for WALRUS.  The responses should indicate how the system will overcome the capabilities listed in the first page (i.e. VTOL capability, damaged runway use, ballast system operations, others).  Responses aimed at subsystem objective (propulsion system, ballast system) should discuss the foreseen challenges and possible uses of listed technologies and others in their solutions. RFI Instructions: 
Company responses to either technology, system or subsystem areas are encouraged to submit no more than a five page responses labeled ?company proprietary?.  Companies providing ?technology responses? that are judged to have technical merit and deemed enabling for Walrus may be invited to discuss their solutions prior to industry day to explore expediting availability of those technologies. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary 6th page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information, technical objective and unique development qualifications.  The additional non-proprietary 6th page will be provided to Industry Day attendees to help encourage early teaming. RFI Responses should be digitally submitted and can be mailed or e-mailed to Preston Carter, DARPA Program Manager, at DARPA, TTO, 3701 N Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22203 or phcarter@DARPA.mil, respectively.  RFI responses should be received no later than COB January 29, 2004. Industry Day: Industry Day will occur on or about March 20th, 2004.  Respondents and others who are interested in attending industry day should check the www.DARPA.mil website for exact time and date.  Interested parties desiring to attend the industry day should submit no more than two names with contact information (e-mail, company, telephone number and address) to jhayes@snap.org with WALRUS Industry Day in the subject line.  Any technical information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary. The names and companies of industry day attendees will be provided to industry day attendees.
