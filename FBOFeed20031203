<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The General Services Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with FISHER CUSTOM COMMUNICATIONS, INC. located in Torrance, CA for Mast Clamped Current Probes (MCCPs) for Navy Ships.  The MCCP is used for the High Frequency (HF) communications receive function.  The MCCP replaces whip antennas currently used on the ship for this function. The subject device is a current transformer. It replaces a receive antenna with a clamp-on current sensor that clamps around the mast of a DDG class ship.  In effect, the mast of the ship becomes the antenna with the receive sensor providing the interface transducer between the HF receiver and the mast. The receiving sensor offers equivalent HF link performance and eliminates the  operational or maintenance penalties of conventional antennas. This device has undergone all testing and approvals required for shipboard use and is designated  an AS-4543/URC antenna.

This MCCP will be installed in the near future and will be based on a design that has already been tested by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC San Diego), San Diego California, which is DoD's Technical Direction Agent for HF antenna design capabilities.  FISHER CUSTOM COMMUNICATIONS’ MCCP was determined to specifically address the unique requirements of the design being utilized for Navy ships.

The hardware specified above has been previously supplied by FISHER CUSTOM COMMUNICATIONS, INC. To maintain consistency, eliminate additional testing, and maintain multi-range compatibility, FISHER CUSTOM COMMUNICATIONS, INC. is the only source of supply for this product and is solely capable of responding to ongoing support requirements. 

The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR6.302-1.  The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes but all interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience related to fulfilling a similar requirement via e-mail to joe.pechinko@gsa.gov by 4:00 p.m., PST, October 28, 2003. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

NWS’s own servers and procedures will be utilized to deploy patches.  Vulnerabilities, errata, and upgrades for which the contractor is required to provide patches will already have been patched for some other version of the Linux operating system, or the patches will be available in source code form from the maintainers of the utilities in question.  The contractor will not be expected to provide drivers for any hardware which has never before been supported under Linux.  Patches must be tested by executing the patched utility on x86 hardware.  The Government may require that certain patches be tested on specific Government Furnished equipment.  The patches shall be provided in easily-installable packages.  RPMs are preferable.   Compressed tar files with installation scripts are acceptable.  The contractor shall provide consultation and support services as necessary to NWS Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) in planning and executing deployment of the patch.

<DESC>NA The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), an agency of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), supports the modal administrations of the DOT through the conduct of engineering studies and research and development activities necessary to evaluate and improve transportation safety and performance.  The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Positive Train Control (PTC) system intends to utilize intelligent transportation technologies to aid the human operators of the national railroad system in preventing accidents while also increasing the capacity of the railroad network for both freight and passenger trains. In a step toward implementing PTC for the national railroad system, the FRA has taken the lead role within the DOT to perform research to assess th e feasibility of improving the accuracy of the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS). In support of FRA PTC initiatives, the Volpe Center of Cambridge, MA, intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Ohio University under authority in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302. The purpose of the negotiations is to reach an agreement on the technique and cost for the development of a prototype NDGPS High Performance architecture and a plan to demonstrate its performance.  This project also requires identification of the major error mitigation factors and the development of an error mitigation approach. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541330. This procurement will be conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in FAR Part 13.   The purpose of this acquisition is to develop NDGPS positioning with accuracy levels of 2-5 centimeters for short baseline lengths (40 km) and accuracy levels of 10-20 centimeters nationwide to improve GPS performance in support of the FRA implementation of Positive Train Control. A step toward this goal shall be the development of a prototype High Performance NDGPS architecture and a plan to demonstrate its performance. Several key items of the proposed architecture shall be addressed to include differential GPS error mitigation techniques and the method for providing corrections to enable high performance for the mobile user. These error mitigation techniques may be common with, or enhance other high accuracy DGPS architectures that are under development by the Federal Aviation Adminis tration (FAA), such as the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS), and the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Detailed specifications will be set forth in the solicitation. A single award will result from the solicitation.  For information concerning this acquisition, contact Alison Shedd at 617/494-2631.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is conducting market research to aid in evaluating a build/buy decision in deploying a web-based enterprise-wide departmental acquisition management information system.  The system should be capable of managing the entire acquisition process including workflow management, document generation and flexible reporting capability.  The system must be able to exchange financial information with the DOT DELPHI financial system (Oracle Financials) and facilitate data exchange with the various current and future components of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  In addition to COTS solutions, DOT is also interested in solutions built upon non-proprietary open standards and web services.  Open standards solutions should discuss technical and cost advantages.  There is no commitment of any future action on behalf of DOT related to this notice.  Electronic submittal (compatible with Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat) of information is preferred and should be limited to ten pages.  Information should be e-mailed to Brian Wolfe at brian.wolfe@ost.dot.gov by December 19, 2003.  The DOT e-mail server has a four MB limit per message.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ), solicitation number F73MAL33220400, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  The proposed acquisition is set aside 100% for HUBZone enterprises.

Fabrication of rib-stiffened panels for buckling tests.    The purpose of the panels will be to support aging aircraft research.  A number of panel buckling tests must be performed to assess the effects of corrosion grind-outs on the buckling strength of rib stiffened panels.

This effort is only for the fabrication and shipping of the panels to be tested.  Because the panels are to be used for buckling tests, it is of the utmost importance that the panels and stringers, in the assembled configuration, are flat.  It is also important that the ends of the panels (ends having the cut stiffener ends) are parallel to each other and flat, and that the stiffener ends are flush with the panel ends.  Compressive buckling loads will be applied at the ends of the flat panels through a flat surface.

Panel fabrication.  The contractor shall fabricate eighteen (18) panels in accordance with drawings.  Nine (9) of the panels shall be in configuration #1, and nine (9) of the panels shall be in configuration #2.  The panels shall be assembled from aluminum alloy 7075-T6.

Partial assembly.  Six (6) of the configuration #1 panels will be partially assembled:  the center stiffener will not be attached to the panel.  However, the holes will be drilled in both the panel and the stiffener in order to facilitate later attachment by the Government.  The rivets for this attachment will be provided with the partially assembled panel.  Likewise, six (6) of the configuration #2 panels will be partially assembled in the same way.  The rivets are described in MIL-STD-20470, “Rivet, Solid, Universal Head, Aluminum and Aluminum alloy.  The 2017 Alloy is desired.

LINE 0001 Configuration #1 panels Quantity 9  Unit Price $_____________ Total Price $_______________.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.    Award will be made on the basis of determining the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price which meets or exceeds the requirements in this document.

The period of performance is estimated to be 2 Jan 2004 through 31 December 2004.  This effort is being sole sourced to Bronson Hills Associates because it is the only company with sufficient knowledge of arctic sea ice, sea ice drafts, sound velocity, and data formats required to perform and complete this effort; however, all responsible sources may submit a response explaining how their company can meet the government's requirements which will be considered by the agency for the purpose of deciding whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The RFQ and statement of work will be available at www.neco.navy.mil about 4 December 2003.   See Note 22.  Commercial procedures are not being used for this effort.

<DESC>The Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake is offering for sale and removal items described on the attached form at Building 101, Catering and Conference Center, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC.  The project will require the contractor to deconstruct the interior of Building 101.  This work will consist of the removal of the current building interior and excess equipment in preparation for future work in building a new interior.  Items available for removal are listed in Appendix A.  The contractor will have approximately two weeks to complete the deconstruction.  The timeframe is tentatively scheduled for 5 January 2004 through 19 January 2004.  Deconstruction methods will be used to the maximum extent possible.  For the purposes of this scope of work, deconstruction is defined as the systematic, controlled dismantling of a structiure in order to maximize the volume of material salvaged from that structure.  This scope of work is only a portion of the work to be completed on this site.  The government anticipates that NDW Public Works will abate regulated building materials at this site.  In addition, a demolition contractor will arrive to complete any removal not practical using deconstruction.  The contractor shall work in concert with the government's selected abatement and demolition contractor in order to maintain the safety and security of the site.  The contractor must make every effort to coordinate its work in a manner that meets the objectives of this project.

The project site encompasses 40.9 acres at the mouth of Redwood Creek, which drains an 8.9 square mile watershed on the southwestern flank of Mt. Tamalpais.  Although the entire site is within GGNRA boundary, only half of the site is owned by NPS.  The remainder is owned by the San Francisco Zen Center and is part of Green Gulch Farm.  A Marin county road, Pacific Way, crosses the site and crosses Redwood Creek.  Reconfiguration of the road and the bridge that crosses Redwood Creek will be included in the restoration design.  The EIS/EIR is expected to comply with the NEPA, NPS' Director's Order 12, NPS Organic Act (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), CEQA Guideline (as amended), Marin County EIR Guidelines and County process for preparation of an EIR.  GGNRA has conducted NEPA scoping for the project.  The scoping meeting held to fulfill NEPA requirements may fulfill CEQA requirements.  Tasks under the scope of work will include but are not limited to: Describe the affected environment by utilizing provided studies and additional data as needed; present detailed descriptions of each alternative; for each alternative (including No Action alternative), evaluate and describe direct, indirect and cumulative impacts as required by the guidelines and statutes cited above; evaluate and describe mitigation and growth inducing impacts, as required by CEQA; and support NPS and Marin County staff in communicating the EIS/EIR process and outcomes to the public, the Big Lagoon Working Group and regulatory agencies.

The research will take place primarily in El Salvador but will be supplemented by interviews in the greater Washington, DC area. Through a series of structured interviews and surveys with male and female migrants, the research will examine the use and meaning of remittance networks and services for men and women, and explore the extent to which women migrants participate in these transnational networks and organizations and exert influence over the decisions taken about the use and disposition of individual and collective remittances.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has a requirement to centralize technical training classes in a single location in support of the Office of Safety's training program.  Administered by the Safety Improvement and Development Team (SIDT), many of these classes are currently held at various geographic locations throughout the Continental United States, although some highly specialized classes require delivery at very specific locations.  These classes are for courses of study developed and delivered by in-house training specialists and FRA will continue to perform these duties using it's own technical training staff.  Normal attendance is approximately 20 students per class with each class being 3 to 4 days in length.  Specific criteria for this requirement is as follows: 1) geographic location for training must be near a major airport served by a sufficient number of air carriers to ensure reasonable competition and service reliability for various geographic areas throughout the Continental U.S.; 2) proximity to railroad facilities including railroad yards, bridges and highway-rail grade crossings and 3) suitable hotels and restaurants in the surrounding area.  The hotels must be in an area considered clean and safe and the cost of the sleeping rooms may not exceed the normal rate established for the geographic area by GSA. The hotels must also meet all Federal Law requirements,  receive, at a minimum, a two-star rating from Mobil, or a two-diamond rating from the American Automobile Association (AAA) and be able to provide between 22 and 65 sleeping rooms for each week during the training season. For distances exceeding 15 miles, a reasonably priced airport shuttle service must be available.  The hotels should also have at least (3) three restaurants within a one-quarter mile walk, only one of which may be a fast food restaurant.  Hotel restaurants count toward the (3) three provided their menu offers a reasonable selection of food choices and the costs are within the "Meals and Incidental Expenses" established by GSA for the geographic area. Site visits to prospective hotels and educational facilities will be conducted prior to contract award.  Specific criteria for training rooms is as follows: 1) rooms must have a minimum clear space of (30) thirty square feet per student; 2) columns may not interfere with the clear space and alcoves within the room must not be counted in the measurement; 3) room width may not exceed 60 percent of the room length and near square configurations are preferred; 4) room must have the capability to be set in the following configuration: a team format with four student tables able to accommodate five students per table, the overall space of the training room must afford students enough space for training materials and equipment as well as a minimum of 30 inches of shoulder-to-shoulder space per person; 5) room should include an area with a trainer table for two people, a projector table and a 5 foot screen at minimum; 6) dimensions and set-up of the room must permit the students a clear view of the screen; 7) ceilings must be at least 9 feet high to provide adequate viewing when using visual aid equipment such as LCD Projectors; 8) there must be two separate sets of lighting in the rooms to give trainers the ability to dim some lights when using the projector; 9) there must be sufficient power outlets in the room to accommodate a power strip at each table; 10) audio visual equipment including training (flip) charts, screens, LCD projectors and power cords must be available either as part of the overall package or on a rental basis as needed. FRA considers packaged availability of LCD projectors as added value particularly if these devices are ceiling mounted in the training rooms; 11) refreshments i.e. coffee and soft drinks must be available for break periods and 12) if training rooms are off-site from the hotel, there must be reasonable dining facilities available for the lunch meal. Criteria for reasonable include pricing, menu selection and close proximity to training rooms. FRA employees must be able to walk to any such dining facilities in 5 minutes or less. Specific criteria for transportation is as follows: 1) contractor provided transportation from the airport to the lodging facilities will be considered; 2) successful offerors must provide transportation from training rooms to hotels and vice versa if the rooms are offsite from the hotel.  Proposals should specifically reference this requirement and all costs associated; 3) transportation must be readily available at least (30) thirty minutes prior to the start of class each day and immediately available at the end of class each day so as to reduce the imposition of training as well as evening free time for the students. A firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract consisting of one base year beginning 1 April 2004 through 30 September 2004 and inclusive of options is anticipated.  The solicitation and any related documents for this procurement will be made available to interested parties through electronic media available for downloading via the Internet at Federal Business (FedBizOpps) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov (formerly Electronic Posting System at http://www.eps.gov) No paper copies of the solicitation will be available.  Potential offerors will be responsible for monitoring the internet site for the release of the solicitation and all responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency. A milestone schedule for this procurement will be posted as a modification to this notice no later than 05 December 2003.  This is an unrestricted solicitation.

<DESC>The U. S. Marine Corps, Cherry Point, NC has a requirement for engineering, technical and training services related to the Chadwick-Helmuth T-24 l/T-58 Engine VXP Test Cell, an integral part of the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer System and the Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS). Both systems are used to conduct rotor track and balance and vibration analysis on the    H-46 helicopter.  The proposed contract action will provide these services from 1 January – 30 November 2004.  

Chadwick-Helmuth is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer System which is a commercial off the shelf item.  In addition, the development and production contract for AIMS was awarded on a competitive basis to Chadwick-Helmuth in June 2003.  The AIMS will integrate the 8500C system into H-46 Helicopter, thus eliminating the need to transport the 8500C on and off the aircraft.    As the OEM for the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer System and subsequently the AIMS, Chadwick-Helmuth is the only known company to have the knowledge, experience, and technical data necessary to fulfill this need.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The NHLBI plans to release a Request for Proposals for a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center to establish a patient and device data registry to track patients receiving mechanical circulatory support for end-stage heart failure.  The registry will also establish a tissue and blood repository.  The registry will benefit the research and practice communities as well as federal agencies concerned with patient safety and oversight.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are participating in planning the registry and will review registry-derived data to in order to make informed decisions concerning mechanical circulatory support as appropriate.  CMS currently requires hospitals to participate in an independent registry for reimbursement for destination therapy.  It is expected that data from patients enrolled in this registry will fulfill federal reporting requirements.

The NHLBI would like information from academic institutions, professional groups and private industries that develop and apply mechanical circulatory support devices to identify optimum parameters to establishing a registry and ways to design and implement an effective program.  Specifically, NHLBI seeks advice concerning core information to be collected, concerns and solutions to protect rights of patients, facilities, providers and support teams and manufacturers.  Also important are independence of data analysis, access to data and data sharing, and potential strategies for the registry to become at least partially self-supporting.  Ways to involve private industry without undermining the independence of the program governance are also sought.

Over the past two decades, mechanical circulatory support devices, such as ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts, have been developed to augment or supplant failing myocardial performance.  This therapy has been used successfully as a bridge to heart transplantation, a bridge to recovery, and, most recently, as destination therapy for intractable heart failure.  Although cardiac transplantation offers life-saving therapy for selected patients, its use is limited by a supply of donor organs that currently meets less than one-tenth the need, and which is steadily decreasing.  As a consequence, the number of mechanical circulatory support device implantations has increased from a cumulative total U.S. experience of 1,000 in 1990, to approximately 1,000 per year in 2000.  The latter figure is expected to increase greatly following the 2002 FDA approval of a destination therapy device and the October 1, 2003, CMS approval for reimbursement for this indication.  Despite favorable survival and quality of life outcomes, mechanical devices have severe and sometimes life-threatening complications associated with infection, thrombosis, and device failure.  Development of new procedures and devices to reduce these complications would be expedited by a systematic, independent analysis of mechanical support device implantation procedures and outcomes.  Cooperation among the federal agencies involved in the development, regulation, and use of circulatory support devices, including NHLBI, FDA and CMS, will permit development of standard reporting of patient characteristics, indications, implantation procedures, and adverse events.  Such cooperation will facilitate clinical evaluation and patient management and aid better device development. 

Heart failure is a malignant cardiac disorder affecting over 4.5 million people in the U.S.; it is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis, exacting substantial morbidity and mortality, and health care resources and costs.  Current therapies improve symptoms, but have only a modest impact on long-term survival. The NHLBI-supported Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) study evaluated the implantation of left ventricular assist devices and optimal medical therapy, versus optimal medical therapy alone, in randomly assigned end-stage heart failure patients ineligible for cardiac transplantation.  REMATCH results demonstrated better survival and quality of life in patients who received the assist devices.  Because the cost of mechanical assistance in REMATCH was similar to transplantation, mechanical assistance offers an important therapeutic alternative to transplantation.  Nevertheless, device therapy can be improved.  Better patient selection, device design and patient management are possible, but require careful evaluation that would be facilitated by data centralization and independent analysis.  A tissue and blood repository would encourage studies of heart failure using cutting-edge approaches, such as genomics and proteomics, the response to mechanical assistance, and the mechanisms underlying the reported improvement in native heart function with these devices.  Information obtained by the registry will aid in the development of improved surgical implantation procedures and patient management paradigms, and also point the way for future research studies.

The registry will support a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center, a tissue and blood repository, and a scientific advisory group to develop protocols for standard procedures to collect patient and device data, tissue, and blood samples for genomic and proteomic investigations.  Registry data would be analyzed to permit understanding of clinical outcomes, complications, and associated therapies.  The registry would serve as a resource to encourage research investigations using centrally collected tissue or data, and would provide information critical to the design of clinical investigations or trials of specific therapeutic interventions.  The proposed interagency registry would build on the progress of the existing registries, and facilitate transfer of federally required data sets without compromising confidentiality of proprietary information.  CMS and FDA participation with NIH will facilitate compliance with federal regulatory requirements, maximize patient safety, and provide necessary information needed for informed decisions regarding reimbursement.

NHLBI seeks comments and suggestions as requested below.

1. Patient outcomes are determined by patient characteristics, surgical provider and facilities support, and device performance.  Please suggest data elements you consider essential for collection by the registry.

2. Abstracting hospital and out-patient data and checking accuracy of submitted data will be required.  Please provide concerns you have about the registry collecting data on patients, devices, hospitals and medical providers.  Please suggest ways the NHLBI can design registry protocols to minimize those concerns.

3. Please identify ways for NHLBI to encourage industry to participate and support the registry.

4. Please suggest ways to design the registry so that participants do not have duplicate reporting requirements.

5. Please provide methods to ensure accuracy and security of data in the registry.

6. Please suggest strategies for the registry to become at least partially self-supporting.
 
7. We would appreciate any additional views or opinions that you think would be useful to develop a registry that will improve outcomes for patients receiving mechanical circulatory support.

Responses in any of the areas are welcome; respondents should not feel compelled to address all items.  Please respond no later than December 30, 2003.  We look forward to your thoughts, opinions and suggestions and hope that you will share this document with your colleagues.  All responses will be kept confidential.  Thank you for your assistance.

<SUBJECT>89 -- Untized Group Ration A Meal (UGR-A)
<SOLNBR>SP0300-04-R-7000
<RESPDATE>012204

<CONTACT>Tracy Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone 215 737-2989, Fax 215 737-4115, Email Tracy.Brown@dla.mil - Lois Dyduck, Contracting Officer, Phone 215 737-3834, Fax 215 737-4115, Email Lois.Dyduck@dla.mil
<DESC>The Unitized Group Ration-A (UGR-A) is a ration consisting of the semi-perishable and perishable foods and disposable items (e.g., cups, trays, trash bags) necessary to feed fifty individuals during peacetime training, as well as mobilization operations.  The meal modules consist of a semi-perishable module (2 cases) containing the semi-perishable food components and disposable items, and the frozen perishable module (1 case), which are delivered concurrently.  A minimum shelf life of six (6) months shall be remaining at time of delivery for CONUS requirements.  OCONUS requirements, which are FOB Origin acceptance, require 9-month shelf life at time of receipt.  The UGR-A consists of 21 menus (7 breakfast, 14 lunch/dinner).  The components are readily available commercial items.

     The purpose of the UGR-A program is to maximize and expedite the Services ability to provide high quality food service meals using commercial, readily available food items (A Rations) to military personnel during worldwide operations.  The UGR-A ration objectives include (i) simplify and streamline the customers ordering process by establishing two stock number to order a complete meal in lieu of multiple menu components, (ii) simplify and streamline the distribution/food handling process in the field by consolidating and clearly identifying the complete components of a single meal; (iii) eliminate inventory carrying costs by utilizing direct vendor deliveries (DVD) to customers on an as needed basis; and (iv) result in overall cost savings In the total food supply chain.

     CONUS meals are not intended to be stocked by the Services and direct vendor delivery to all customers will be utilized.   OCONUS rations may be DLA owned stock, and stored in Prime Vendor facilities in such locations as Korea, Bahrain, Kuwait, or delivered DVD for customers in Germany (the reduced customer base due to OIF deployment has resulted in the inability to stock UGR-A in Germany).  OCONUS deliveries are made FOB Origin by contractors, and shipped overseas via the Defense Transportation System (DTS).

     This acquisition will provide complete ration modules for each menu, for each of the 50 CONUS and 25 OCONUS installations supported to date.  These installations, and the Army, have stated their continued long-term requirement for the UGR-A, but are unable to forecast their quantified annual usage.  In order to calculate the best future requirement estimates possible, the actual usage for 01, 02, and 03 has been captured and best-guess estimates have been projected for the instant acquisition future years.  This approach has been approved by the Army Center for Excellence, Subsistence (ACES).  Additionally, the solicitation will include the actual order history for each installation, to be provided by the current UGR-A contractors.

     Complete commercial item descriptions for each item in each menu were developed by DSCP, Natick and ACES and have been approved by authorized military food service representatives.  The UGR-A ration and specifications are totally commercial, with no technically restrictive requirements.

     Utilizing Best Value source selection procedures, this solicitation will indicate that technical merit is more important than price.  It is the Government’s intention to make an award to the offerors who indicate the overall best value utilizing the trade off process between price and non-price factors.  

The installations will be grouped on a regional basis; Northeast, Southeast, Central and West Region.  Each region includes a major training facility along with National Guard/Air National Guard customers.    This acquisition will be issued on a competitive basis.  It’s the Government’s intention to award one Indefinite Quantity Type contract per region, however the government reserves the right to award more then one contract per region in order to acquire complete coverage and/or result in the best value to the Government.  

   Each contract will be awarded for a two-year base period with three (3) two-year option periods.

   The solicitation will also allow for the inclusion of additional customers within the awarded distribution regions, e.g. Air Force, and Marines.  To allow for these additions, as well as possible training increases, the IQC maximum quantities will be 300% of the estimated quantities.  The minimum IQC quantity is 20%.  Surge Option and readiness provisions will be included in the event of contingencies.
   
   Estmated quantities for the 2 year base period and each 2 year option, respectfully, are: 1,251,770 mods, 1,155,480 mods, and 915,480 mods for both option periods 3 and 4.  

Solicitation will be issued unrestricted with a Hubzone Price Evaluation Preference.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is being issued to provide Questions and Answers, to include version 8.0 as part of the support, and to require separate technical and pricing submissions for three scenarios.  Questions (Q) and Answers (A):  (Q1) What type of support does the Government require?  Is it 24/7 or normal business hours?  (A1) The most important element of support is provision of patches.  The vendor should place the patches on a server that the Government can access at the Government’s convenience via ftp or sftp.  Other requests for support will be rare, and will be during normal business hours.  (Q2) Will the support require onsite, offsite, or a combination of both support?  (A2) The Government expects that requests for support (other than provision of patches) will be rare.  Such requests will usually be handled by telephone, but it is possible that visits to Government integration and test facilities in the Washington Metropolitan Area may be required.  (Q3) How many systems will require Red 7.2 patch/driver support?  (A3) The Government will handle all patch deployment and other “per machine” issues, so the number of systems involved should not be relevant.  User-level support is handled by currently existing engineering staff.  Somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 machines are involved.  Up to two NWS programs may be involved, so there will be at most two different machine configurations.  (Q4) Will the Government furnish equipment at the contractor’s site for testing of developed patches/drives?  (A4) No. Routine testing of patches may be done on commodity Intel x86 hardware with the contractor is expected to own.  Testing of hardware-specific patches may require visits to the Government’s integration and test facilities in the Washington Metropolitan Area.  (Q5) How does the Government require the deployment of patches/drivers?  By onsite, offsite link, or best means method?  The Government recommends that the patches be loaded on to the contractor’s ftp or sftp server.  Up to three Government IP addresses should be granted access to the server to download patches.  Contractor’s server should have a reliable internet connection providing data transfer speed of at least 600 kilobits per second.  According to the commercial definition and the performance based acquisition solution, the contractor needs to come up with the best solution that will meet the Government’s needs.  The contractor must be able to stand by any solution provided to the Government.  (Q6) Will the Government provide the contractor any office/test bench space at the Government location?  (A6) If onsite testing or consultation is required, the Government will provide the necessary access and facilities on an ad-hoc basis.  (Q7) Does the Government require a Time and Material or a Cost Plus quotation?  (A7) The Government is expecting a firm-fixed price quotation.  This is a commercial acquisition and commercial acquisition can only be firm-fixed price methodology.  If the contractor is asked to provide additional services besides supporting the Red Hat, the contractor will need to provide labor categories and labor rates for that type of work.  The Government will provide a line item for a not-to-exceed amount for this particular purpose.  (End of Questions and Answers)  All additional information will be shown within the solicitation via quotations.  (End of Amendment)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is DG133W-04-RQ-0014 and this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation has incorporated provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-17.  This acquisition is being conducted as a full and open competitive requirement.  The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service (NWS) presently has custom-written software running on Intel x86-based computers using the Red Hat Linux “operating system, versions 7.2 and 8.0.  Those OS versions” are scheduled for end-of-life (termination of support by Red Hat) on 31 December 2003.  NWS has a requirement to continue to use “those versions” through September 2005.  Therefore, NWS is looking for contractors who have the capability to support the Red Hat 7.2 “and 8.0” until “they are” replaced in September 2005.  The required support consists of providing tested binary patches for the component packages in Red Hat Linux 7.2 “and 8.0”.  The contractor shall promptly provide patches for any reported security vulnerabilities that affect any components of Red Hat Linux 7.2 “and 8.0”, and also provide any patches that the above-mentioned security-related patches depend on.  The contractor will also provide patches (drivers) as requested to support new hardware, and patches as requested to support upgrades to component packages of Red Hat 7.2 “and 8.0”.  NWS’s own servers and procedures will be utilized to deploy patches.  Vulnerabilities, errata, and upgrades for which the contractor is required to provide patches will already have been patched for some other version of the Linux operating system, or the patches will be available in source code form from the maintainers of the utilities in question.  The contractor will not be expected to provide drivers for any hardware which has never before been supported under Linux.  Patches must be tested by executing the patched utility on x86 hardware.  The Government may require that certain patches be tested on specific Government Furnished equipment.  The patches shall be provided in easily-installable packages.  RPMs are preferable.   Compressed tar files with installation scripts are acceptable.  The contractor shall provide consultation and support services as necessary to NWS Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) in planning and executing deployment of the patch.  The contractor may be asked to provide services or assistance for diagnosing OS, infrastructure (for example XFree86), and hardware problems.  The contractor shall submit a statement of work and a quality assurance plan that address the above requirements and the following scenarios:   
(1) Patches for critical security vulnerabilities must be made available as soon as possible after the NWS requests them.  The contractor will have only five business days after notification to provide a test patch.  (2) Patches to support hardware and software upgrades:  NWS will notify the contractor at least 30 calendar days before the required delivery date.  (3) The contractor may be asked to provide assistance with low-level systems programming or diagnostic services.  This acquisition is for one base year with one one-year option.  The anticipated start date for this acquisition is 01 January 2004.  The following provisions apply to this RFQ: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, Technical/Management/Past Performance portion of the proposal shall be submitted separately from the Price portion; 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, Technical/Management/Past Performance is more important than price.  The Contractor’s Solution to the above requirement will be evaluated.  “The solution will also include (1) Support for only Red Hat 7.2 as described above; (2) Support for only Red Hat 8.0 as described above; (3) Support for both Red Hat 7.2 and Red 8.0 as described above.”  The Contractor’s Quality Assurance Plan will be evaluated, and the Contractor’s Past Performance will be evaluated.  For Past Performance, Contractor’s must submitted relevant experience along with points of contact information.  The past performance data can not be no more than 3 years old.  Cost is not scored but will be evaluated for realism.  Provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items also applies.  52.212-3 must be completed and submitted with the Contractor’s proposal.  The following clauses apply: 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders – Commercial Items.  The following clauses within this clause will apply: (13); (15); (16); (17); (18); (19); (27); (28); (29); and (30).  The above clauses and provisions can be found at www.acqnet.gov.  Proposals are due to the Primary Contact via e-mail by 12 December 2003, 12:00 p.m. eastern time.  The start date of this acquisition is very important so if any interested parties have any questions.  Request you submit your questions immediately to the primary contact.

<RESPDATE>020104
<ARCHDATE>02012004
<CONTACT>Richard F. Fox, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-6395
<DESC>This announcement serves as notice to all potential offerors that, on or about 18 December 2003, the Airborne, Maritime and Fixed Station (AMF) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Program Office, Networks and Information Integration (NI) Directorate, Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts anticipates release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8726-04-R-0001 for successful completion of the AMF JTRS Pre-System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase. The AMF JTRS Program has a two-phase development strategy: Pre-SDD and SDD.  Pre-SDD is focused on the Radio Frequency (RF), network, and system architectures and initial designs for the AMF JTRS that will minimize platform integration costs.  The purpose of this fifteen (15) month contract effort, which will be executed concurrently by two Contractors, is to define system requirements and interface requirements and to proceed with initial development through PDR.  A key objective of this Pre-SDD contract is to define and document performance requirements and associated system architectures that enable common software and hardware implementations across form factors/configurations.  The PDR will occur no later than eleven (11) months after contract award.  The resulting modular and scaleable design shall result in a system meeting or exceeding all JTRS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) threshold requirements for the Airborne and Maritime/Fixed Station domains, accommodate all platform requirements, and support network-centric operations.  The results from the Pre-SDD phase (networking attributes, platform interface requirements, and modular design) will feed directly into the Government's SDD planning.  For SDD, the Government plans to conduct a full and open competition to select a single prime system contractor that will qualify the required number of JTR production sources, and to focus on post-PDR design, testing, certification.  The SDD contract will include priced options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of AMF JTRS. The Pre-SDD acquisition will follow the competitive procedures of FAR Part 15 and associated supplements and utilize full and open competition.  The Government plans to award two (2) cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) and Time and Materials - Labor Hour (T&M - LH) contracts, executed concurrently and conducted independently by the contractors, to complete the Pre-SDD effort.  There will be a requirement for data deliveries consisting primarily of technical reports, specifications, and interface control documents.  The solicitation will be posted on the Internet at the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) website: http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil.  Under "Business Opportunities", set "Type" and "Location" to "ALL", click "Go", and then scroll down to "Airborne, Maritime, and Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System."  In addition, the solicitation will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Offerors will be provided forty-five (45) calendar days to respond to the solicitation.  The Government will request that offeror's proposals remain effective for 120 days following receipt by the Government.  Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Foreign-owned firms, including Canadian sources, will not be eligible to compete.  Interested contractors desiring business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System. The Pre-SDD effort requires access to the following classified information: Unified Information Security (INFOSEC) Criteria (UIC). The Government will post on the HERBB a copy of a DD Form 254 to be downloaded for contractor completion of blocks 6a, 6b, and 6c.  The completed DD Form 254 shall be submitted via facsimile to Mr. Richard Fox, ESC/NIK Contracting Officer, at 781-377-2657.  Upon verification of the DD Form 254, the Government will contact the offeror to set up an appointment for offeror's review at Hanscom AFB, MA at a date no earlier than the release of the RFP.  A hard copy of the completed DD Form 254 shall be provided with the submission of the proposal.  The Pre-SDD effort requires access to certain waveform specifications and other documentation with Government Purpose Rights.  The offeror will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements before any Government Purpose Rights data/information is released to an offeror, per DFARS 227.7013-7 and 252.227-7013(b)(2)(iii)(A). This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, offerors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.   Please direct any questions on this NOCA to the following individuals at ESC/NIK: Richard Fox, Contracting Officer, 781-377-6395, Richard.Fox@hanscom.af.mil or Ann Bastek, Contract Specialist, 781-377-7512, Ann.Bastek@hanscom.af.mil. *****  See Note 26.

This project will be called the “Large Capacity Shelter CB Liner (LCS CB Liner).”  It will be a 5-layer Saranex laminate CB liner, that will be used in conjunction with other CB components in inventory to provide a collective protection (CP) system that is needed in bare base, medical, and special operations deployments worldwide.

Approximate dimensions for each liner are: 29 ½ feet wide by 26 feet long with a height of 10 feet. Each MSS will use 2 liners that will connect to each other to create approximate a 1,500 sq ft toxic free area.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Advance Notice of Publication
<DESC>Advance Notice of Publication: The General Accounting Office (GAO) will shortly publish Volume I of PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW, third edition – also know as “The Red Book.”  This publication is part of multi-volume set intended to present a basic reference work covering those areas of law in which the Comptroller General renders decisions.  Our approach is to lay a foundation with text discussion, using specific legal authorities to illustrate the principles discussed, their application, and exceptions.  These authorities include GAO decisions and opinions, judicial decisions, statutory provisions, and other relevant sources.  GAO will provide copies of this volume to the heads of federal agencies.  Agencies may place advance (rider) orders for additional copies of this volume with their account representatives at the Government Printing Office (GPO).  This notice is not intended to solicit orders from the general public for single copies or small orders of this volume.  GPO will offer Volume I for sale to the general public at a later time.  Rider orders for Volume I should be placed on Standard Form #1 and should specify GAO Requisition No. 4-00051.  Agency orders for Volume I must be received by GPO no later than December 29, 2003.  GPO will not accept rider requisitions for Volume I after this date, and agencies will have to purchase additional copies from the Superintendent of Documents.  All rider requisitions must be submitted to GPO through each agency’s Washington, D.C. headquarters printing procurement office.    In compiling your agency’s total order, GAO suggests that you consider the needs of legal offices, finance offices, contracting offices, libraries, Inspector General offices, field and regional offices, and any other elements of your agency that might use this publication.  As with the second edition of Principles, we are publishing the third edition in loose-leaf format.  We plan four volumes with annual updates.  The updates will only be published electronically.  Users should retain copies of their five volumes of the second edition until each volume is revised.  We will not revise Volume III of the second edition, which we issued in November 1994.  Volume III addresses functions that the GAO Act of 1996 transferred to the Executive Branch.    

This is not a request for a quotation. No contract will be awarded on the basis of orders received in response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>R -- New Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Requirement
<DESC>TO ALL CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTORS-------- 


In an effort to comply with a recent Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requirement (FAR 52.204-7), which mandates all existing and prospective government contractors that wish to continue doing business with or receive an award from the federal government to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) strongly encourages you to register your company in the CCR system.  The CCR system allows government departments access to a consolidated source of contractor data and is the primary resource database for doing business with the government.  Your cooperation will ensure a smooth transition and assist in minimizing delays in contract awards and payments

The CCR system provides a web-based vendor database containing a multitude of qualified vendors and is used for market research by a vast majority of government buyers in search of potential contractors that offer quality goods and services.  The CCR collects, validates, stores and disseminates data in support of agency missions.  Additionally, CCR shares the data with several federal government agencies and federal agency finance offices to facilitate paperless payments through Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).   The registration requirements are free of charge and require completion of a one-time registration. In addition, the contractor will be responsible for providing the CCR system with annual updates and renewals in order to maintain an active status.

The first step in the registration process is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identification number.  This 9-digit DUNS number will act as the primary mechanism for tracking and identifying unique business entities.  Obtaining a DUNS number is a free service provided by Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., who can be reached toll-free at (866)705-5711 or via Internet at http://www.dnb.com.  Once your company has been issued a DUNS number, you become eligible to register in the CCR system via Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Should you require additional assistance in registering, the CCR Assistance Center can be reached toll-free at (888)227-2423 or (269)961-5757.  The registration process takes approximately 48 hours for activation.

Once your registration has become active, you will receive two notifications via U.S. mail or E-mail.  The first notification will be to welcome you to CCR and the second notification will contain a Trading Partner Identification Number (TPIN).  The TPIN is your confidential password that allows registered contractors to make any subsequent changes and updates to their active registrations. For security reasons, the TPIN is not to be used on contracts or any other government documentation.  All existing and prospective government contractors are required to be registered in the CCR.  If you are a prospective contractor and you are not registered in the CCR database by the date of award selection, the contracting officer will proceed to award to the next registered offeror.  If you have an existing contract and you do not register your company in the CCR system, HRSA will be unable to continue federal government business with your company and all payments will be suspended until registration has been completed.  

At HRSA, we measure our success by constantly improving our customer's satisfaction and making more efficient use of our resources. The Central Contractor Registration system will allow our agency a means of becoming even more efficient in providing our customers needs.   As always, it is our pleasure to serve you and we look forward to our continued success.

ALL CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED IN THE CCR BY DECEMBER 31, 2003.

<SUBJECT>--For more information please contact Mr. Joe Traino, 410-436-6471/4416. Please DO NOT contact Marjorie Roberts.
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE 04-1) for biological point identification technologies.  TRE 04-1 is being scheduled in the May/June 2004 timeframe at the Solomon La boratory, Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah and the test duration is not expected to exceed 2 weeks.  Plans are underway to conduct the biological point identification evaluation in two phases depending on the number of respondents and potential participan ts. Phase I will be conducted as a preliminary screening of prototype or fully developed systems in early Feb/March 2004. to aid in determining eligibility of biological identification systems to participate in Phase II.  Phase I involves killed pathogens in a  Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution delivered as Government Furnished Material to each vendor for identifier evaluation. The bio safety level required is no greater than BL2.  Specifically, DPG will prepare liquid challenge samples from gamma irradia ted Bacillus anthracis (BA), Yersinia pestis (YP), and Vaccinia.  DPG will ship the challenge samples (including blanks) to a valid vendor (participant) address by certified mail (UPS or Fed Ex) and immediate receipt verification will be required.  The cha llenge samples (6 total) in numbered vials for each participant will be shipped for analysis and identification.  A report of challenge sample identification by vial # must be furnished to the TRE Team within 72 hours after receipt of vials, by following i nstructions provided with the challenge samples.  Antibodies only for pathogens listed above will be furnished upon request made by the participant.  A written request that includes the name and address of the POC to receive the antibodies must be received  at the following address by January 14, 2004 at the latest:  Dr. Peter Emanuel, JPEO for CB Defense, Critical Reagent Program, SFAE-CBD-CBMS-MITS, E3150, Room# 356, 5183 Blackhawk Road, APG, MD 21010.  Based on an assessment of Phase I information, a down  selection of bioidentifier systems will be made for Phase II (Laboratory Trials), and participants will be notified. Phase II is a laboratory evaluation to be conducted at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah using daily liquid samples.  It is estimated that not more than 30 liquid sample challenges per day will be distributed on site to each participant.  The challenges will be comprised of the same agents in a PBS buffer solution used in Phase I at various concentration levels.  Some challenges will contain multiple pathogens and blanks to be identified by the participants on a daily basis. Participating vendors and their equipment will be evaluated for potential applicability in future biological defense systems, such as a Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), and upgrades to the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS). The intent of TRE 04-1 is to identify technology for our development/acquisition programs and system-upgrades.  The U.S. Army is under no obligation to select any participating technologies.  TRE 04-1 will offer participants an opportunity to obtain unique  performance data that can be used in their development work.  The US Army is not responsible for any costs incurred by the participants as a result of attending this TRE.

Project Title: 	Guidance on the Use of Gel Flocculants to Reduce Sediment Runoff Due to Roadway Construction
Statement of Problem:
Managing roadway construction project sediment runoff is a problem on most projects for the responsible parties.  Many times projects include in-stream work where sediment laden construction water runoff has the opportunity to enter waters containing sensitive and protected species. Keeping the turbidity levels of project runoff water to that which is acceptable to regulatory agencies requires separating sediment from runoff water and collecting it.  In most cases this proves to be extremely difficult regardless of cost.  The methods that have been available in the past to mitigate turbid runoff water have been at times unreliable and of questionable benefit.  This has left roadway builders, engineers, and managers to look for better solutions.  

Traditional measures to manage or mitigate sediment runoff include straw bale barriers, silt fence, filter fabric, detention ponds and infiltration basins.  A recent advancement in sediment runoff treatment utilizes fast acting flocculants.  These flocculants bond to sediment and force it to fall out of suspension.  The sediment can be captured either in sand filters or be allowed to fall out onto biofiltration areas.  Currently several different flocculent sediment removal approaches are being implemented for both roadway and facilities construction.  

The design and construction community lacks clear guidance in implementing this new technology.  A comprehensive user’s guide for gel flocculants needs to be developed to help utilize the technology in the control of silt, to facilitate specification development and aid construction engineers in identifying control measures for specific soil and hydraulic conditions.  The net result is less silt intrusion in sensitive areas and better control of runoff.
Implementation Objectives (Scope of Work):
The objective of this study is to synthesis the use of gel flocculant methods pertaining to turbidity reduction of construction site runoff water and to develop best management practices for implementation.   Specific activities to achieve the project goals are to: (1) conduct a review of published information to summarize the performance of gel flocculants; (2) interview knowledgeable individuals to identify problems and needs specific to FHWA and collect current unpublished information; (3) evaluate gel flocculants and treatment types in multiple field sites in different conditions of substrate and climate by collecting qualitative and quantitative data; (4) prepare guidelines and best management practices for using gel flocculants and associated treatment methods; (5) prepare meaningful specifications for the use of gel flocculant technology on FHWA projects; and (6) prepare final report and summary reports.  By performing this study, it is intended that the results will become policy and technical guidance for designers, geotechnical staff and construction engineers.

To assist in the objective, the FHWA will form a “Technical Committee”, composed of FHWA staff and other transportation agencies to review and comment on content, including additions, deletions, or modifications. 

The content of the guide should include a thorough description of the technology including an introduction to storm water treatment.  In addition the guide should evaluate the effects of site characteristics (soil type, climatic conditions, topography, existing vegetation) and site hydraulics, flocculent water treatment processes, designing and sizing flocculent water treatment systems (passive and active systems), flocculent water treatment system operations and maintenance, Best Management Practices, and specifications.  The guide should be useful in both the design and construction phase of most roadway projects.
Tasks:
Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the study. The FHWA is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the deployment. Proposers are expected to describe deployment plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposer’s current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objective.
At a minimum, the proposed scope of work shall include the following tasks:

1.	Conduct a literature search to identify the current techniques, uses, methods, and procedures.  Define severe weather impact on storm water treatment.
2.	Summarize the recent performance of gel flocculants for the treatment of construction site runoff water.  The study should include as many cases as possible involving gel flocculants in highway construction projects over the last 10 years.
3.	The collection of qualitative and quantitative data from multiple construction projects representing various substrate and climates. The FHWA projects may be located within Alaska, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Washington region.  Document the treatment design, field operation, project performance goals, performance information such as sediment load reduction, costs and summarize advantages and limitations.  Video documentation should be included. 
4.	Develop Best Management Practices for the technology.
5.	Review the FLH’s specification format at http://www.wfl.fhwa.dot.gov/design/flh_ref.htm and provide appropriate specification for the gel flocculant material and treatment method to be included in future construction contracts.  
6.	Develop a work plan that provides details on the proposed guide content and methodology to obtain study information 30 days after commencement of the study.
7.	Submit a draft report within 12 months after commencement of the study with findings and recommendations.
8.	Attend two meetings of the Technical Committee in Vancouver, Washington. The first meeting will be after the Notice to Proceed and the second meeting will be after the Technical Committee has reviewed the draft report.
9.	Meet with the technical panel via teleconference monthly to review progress.
10.	Submit a final report in the form of a camera-ready copy and in the electronic format of MS Word.
11.	Present a PowerPoint training presentation to the technical panel and other FLH personnel to demonstrate results of the study.
