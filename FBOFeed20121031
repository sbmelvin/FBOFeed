The HMDS Industry Day will be held on Tuesday, 12 June 2012 at the Ft. Belvoir Community Center, Bldg 1200, 10300 Taylor Road, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, 22060.  The Industry Day will be UNCLASSIFIED. All interested parties are invited to attend this Industry Day where the Government team will present an overview of the HMDS Program vision, goals and objectives, planned acquisition strategy, and program schedule. It is anticipated that a DRAFT Statement of Work, Performance Specification, and Interface Control Document will be available 29 May 2012.  Any sources interested in obtaining a copy of these documents should submit a request via email to the Contract Specialist, Alison Landin, at alison.m.landin.civ@mail.mil. The email should contain the company name, address, and telephone number. TELEPHONIC REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.<br><br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES:  The Army requires capabilities to support Army route clearance and area clearance operations by detecting and marking the location of surface laid and buried explosive threats, including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) with pressure activated trigger mechanisms, unexploded ordnance (UXO), landmines, and weapons caches. These capabilities are described as follows:<br>(1) A Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is required to detect surface-laid and buried, metallic and low-metallic, explosive hazards in a wide range of road surfaces and soil conditions. The probability of detection is required to be not less than 95% of surface-laid hazards and not less than 90% of hazards buried down to 8 inches (20.3 cm) of soil/road surface overburden. The probability of detection is required to be not less than 90% of metallic and low metallic pressure activated IED trigger mechanisms buried down to 5 inches (12.7 cm) of overburden. The false alarm rate (FAR) is required to be 10 or fewer false alarms per linear kilometer of the road scanned. <br><br>(2) The Deep Buried Detection Capability is required to detect deep buried metallic Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and metallic encased caches. The probability of detection is required to be not less than 85% of metallic IEDs and not less than 85% of metallic encased caches buried down to 48 inches (1.2 meters) of soil overburden. The FAR is required to be 10 or fewer false alarms per linear kilometer of road scanned and 10 or fewer false alarms per 3,500 square meters of area scanned for cache detection. <br><br>(3) The Marking Capability is required to accurately and precisely mark the detected explosive hazards and trigger mechanisms detected by the GPR and Deep Buried Detection Capabilities to minimize the area required to be interrogated by a digging arm on a following vehicle (digging arm is not part of this survey). This capability is required to have both manual and automatic marking of the road surface within 0.5 meter from the edge of the buried threat. The mark is required to be visible during daylight and night, in limited visibility, and in inclement weather for not less than 1 hour at a minimum standoff distance of 30 meters. <br><br>Common Attributes: The GPR, Deep Buried Detection, and Marking Capabilities are required to be installed on the Husky simultaneously. The two detection capabilities are not required to operate simultaneously. The sensor for each detection capability is required to be mounted forward of the Husky to enable the Husky to be stopped before it overruns an explosive hazard. Each detection capability is required to scan a path width of at least 3.5 meters. While seated inside the Husky, the operator must be able to raise and lower detection sensors to avoid impacting the road surface, to configure the HMDS sensors for fording, and to move the sensors to a secure position on the Husky for rapid administrative movement. Each of the two capabilities are required to be interoperable with Blue force electronic warfare devices. <br><br>A contract is planned for award in FY13 beginning with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and continuing with priced options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and then Full Rate Production (FRP). The purpose of the 17-month EMD is to integrate highly mature technologies and designs onto the Mark III Husky vehicle. The EMD phase will require 5 systems for Government testing, with a delivery of two systems required 6 months following contract award. The purpose of LRIP is to deliver approximately 10 production representative systems for Government Operational Testing. The purpose of FRP is production of approximately 150 systems and spare parts and support of worldwide fielding to Army route clearance patrols.<br><br>INDUSTRY DAY GOALS:  The purpose of Industry Day is (1) to outline the HMDS program goals and objectives; (2) to familiarize participants with PM CM & EOD interest in the three major Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) capabilities to support Army route and area clearance operations; (3) to identify potential Offerors and promote understanding of the HMDS proposal requirements; and (4) to promote discussion among potential program participants.  Widest industry participation is highly encouraged; it is our desire to facilitate the formation of strong teams and business relationships in order to develop comprehensive, quality responses to any potential PM CM & EOD solicitation for HMDS.<br>  <br>The Government also invites industry to participate in individual-company sessions from 1400 to 1700 on Tuesday 12 June 2012. If needed, individual-company sessions will continue on 13 June 2012 starting at 0900.  Potential offerors will have twenty (20) minutes to conduct private discussions with the Government.  Potential offerors must submit their request to have individual-company sessions with the Government by 1600 EST on 24 May 2012 in accordance with registration instructions below.

<DESC>Reclamation's Great Plains Regional intends to solicit quotations for janitorial services at the Oklahoma City Field Office, which is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in Oklahoma County.  The work under the solicitation will consist of the furnishing of all labor, materials, transportation, cleaning supplies, equipment, and supervision necessary to satisfactorily perform janitorial services as specified in the associated Performance Work Statement. The Government has estimated the number of square feet of floor space and the contractor shall make no claim against the Government for any excess or deficiency therein.  There is a total of approximately 7,875 square feet.  The anticipated period of performance includes a twelve-month base period and four one-year option periods.
Reclamation strongly urges interested offerors to inspect the site where the contractor will perform janitorial services and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of purchase order performance.  Failure by prospective offerors to inspect the site will not relieve the offerors from the responsibility of properly estimating the difficulty and cost of successfully performing the work in accordance with the Government's requirements.  Reclamation has scheduled an organized site visit at the Oklahoma City Field Office for November 21, 2012 at 10:00 am.  Detailed information regarding the site visit will be included in the solicitation.
Pursuant to Part 12 and Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Reclamation intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on or around November 15, 2012.  Quotes will be due on or around November 30, 2012.  Reclamation anticipates issuing the RFQ under the total small business set-aside program.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561720 and the associated Small Business Size Standard is $16.5 million.
The RFQ will be available for viewing through electronic commerce.  Reclamation will issue RFQ Number R13PS60058 via https://www.fbo.gov, at the link provided in this notice.  Interested vendors may also check Reclamation's website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The RFQ and any subsequent amendments and/or notices will be available to vendors on these websites after November 15, 2012.
Effective July 29, 2012, any contractor interested in doing business with the Federal Government must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a contract or agreement.  SAM is a Federal Government owned and operated FREE website that consolidates the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).  The vendor's Duns & Bradstreet number and banking information are required for registration.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM website accessed through https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ or by contacting the Federal Service Desk at 1-866-606-8220.

While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery, and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

These control panels are to be replaced with the newest variant of the Trane Adaptiview Control Panel Package.  This package is to contain the newest display, UC 800 Controller, mounting swing arm and the new control panel. Included in this project is the connection and full integration of the new control panel system with the facility's DDC system which consists of the Johnson Control's Metasys System.  The panels shall be programmed with all communication units of the English format and not the Metric format.  For example, Degree F shall be used not Degree C. Also included in this statement of work is the replacement of the conduit and wiring system of the Johnson Control's Metasys System to the three older Trane Chillers (CH 100, CH 400 and CH 500).  A single conduit may be run to the ceiling above these chillers; however, from this location three (3) separate conduits shall be run from this point to each of the three older chillers.  Chiller 200 is the newest of the four (4) chillers and is not included with the re-conduit and re-wiring effort.  The existing wiring and conduit for Chiller 200 may be re-used if possible.  The existing, old wiring shall be removed from the existing conduit for Chiller 100, Chiller 400 and Chiller 500.  This wiring is not to be abandoned in place.  This work shall be accomplished by JCI. The Tracer TU Service Tool shall be provided for work on the panels. Any and all associated work required to install and return the four chillers to full operation is included in this work.  This associated work includes but is not limited to removal and replacement of the control panels, removal and replacement of the refrigerant charge, marking and revisions to the control system wiring, removal and replacement of existing sensors, transducers, brackets, required pressure and vacuum testing, required or recommended oil changes and refrigerant dryer servicing.  A certified trained technician shall perform this work.  The refrigerant technician shall have the qualifications and requirements, as specified in the Federal Clean Air Act and FAA Order 1050.18.

<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.
<p>TOPIC:</p>
<p>The US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources with the expertise necessary to rapidly modify a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) suspension to improve ride quality, handling, safety, and durability throughout the range of vehicle weights, weight distributions, and center of gravity (CG) locations of the current HMMWV fleet (9,500 lbs. to 15,500 lbs.). The suspension components that satisfy all of the requirements below may be evaluated via modeling and simulation, and have the potential to be purchased and tested in a lab or on a HMMWV of the Governments choosing. Emphasis should be placed on ready to field, low cost solutions that have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or higher currently.</p>
<p>Suspension enhancements must be applicable and adaptable to the military environment. This environment includes extreme ambient operating conditions from -40&deg;C to 60&deg;C (-40&deg; to 140&deg; Fahrenheit), storage conditions of -51&deg;C to 71&deg;C (-60&deg; to 160&deg; Fahrenheit), as well as extreme shock and vibration outlined in MIL-STD-810.

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected<br />3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data, <br />4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS". <br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br />6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting in the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSA's use of such information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSA's evaluation of the information received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result of this Notice, the NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Young people 16-to-20 years old are especially vulnerable to crash injury or death, with motor vehicle crashes being the leading cause of death for that age range.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is essential that NHTSA be proactive in addressing young driver traffic safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a data-driven organization, this means collecting and analyzing quality data to identify the nature of young driver traffic safety problems, to guide development of intervention approaches, and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While crash and fatality databases are invaluable sources of data applicable to these tasks, they do not tell the entire story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Attitudes, perceptions, knowledge, beliefs, preferences, and related factors can play a key role in how the circumstances underlying a crash evolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By necessity, much of this information will need to come from self-report by young drivers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA has determined that electronic self-report should be the primary mode of information collection, both because this mode reduces pressures to respond in a socially desirable way as well as the preference of young people to use newer information technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, including a second response mode option has been shown to enhance response rates of surveys that use the Web.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to carry out all Tasks associated with testing, implementation, monitoring, data management, and reporting requirements for a multi-mode young driver (ages 16 through 20) survey with Web as the primary response mode and mail as a second response mode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There also will be a backup telephone option for young drivers who indicate they don't have Web access and want to take the survey by telephone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sampling frame will be driver license databases of States that choose to participate in the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA will contact the States, solicit their participation, and obtain systematically selected samples from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA has developed the questionnaire (which is divided into two versions), but it was designed for Web administration and will need to be adapted to multi-mode administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The project will be divided into two phases, with Tasks apportioned as follows:</p>

<p>2. Crashworthy Protection. The seating systems shall provide crashworthy protection up to and including 20G longitudinal, 20G vertical, and 20G lateral for troop anthropometric range fifth percentile male through ninety-fifth percentile male while wearing current MH-60S aircrew combat gear.</p>
<p>3. Troop restraint. The seating systems shall retain the occupant for troop anthropometric range from fifth percentile male through ninety-fifth percentile male and provide load distribution in the most likely impact areas.</p>
<p>4. Accessibility. The seats shall provide a configuration that allows all mission essential equipment to be accessible and secure while providing the required seating for all crew members.</p>
<p>5. Ergonomics. The seating systems shall improve the ergonomics of the troop seats to accommodate MH-60S aircrew in current combat gear and the troop anthropometric range from the fifth percentile male through ninety-fifth percentile male.</p>
<p>6. Reliability and Availability. The seating systems shall provide a system reliability of 0.90 and an availability of 0.90.</p>
<p>7. Modularity and Flexibility. The seating systems shall maintain or increase current MH-60S seat modularity and configuration flexibility while maintaining current or greater maximum seating capacity.</p>
<p>8. Elapsed Maintenance Time (EMT). The installation and removal time for the seating systems shall be equal to or less than 15 minutes for all seats. The installation and removal time for a single troop or gunner's seat shall be equal to or less than 2 minutes .</p>
<p>9. Mission Capability. The installation and removal of the seating systems shall not impact the concept of operations for all current MH-60S mission areas as delineated within the document available at the following link: http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2011/pdf/navy/2011mh-60s.pdf.</p>
<p>10. Weight Restrictions. The gross weight of the fully installed troop seat system and gunner seat system shall be less than or equal to 328 pounds.</p>
<p>11. Using both legacy and new seats. The seating systems shall allow for interchangeability with the current troop seat system by entire row or within rows by individual seat.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</span></p>

 NNSY does not have SPMT equipment or experienced/qualified SPMT operators. NNSY is considering contracting for the services of a shipbuilding contractor with the unique capabilities and experience in moving, aligning, and welding submarine hull sections using SPMTs, to meet availability delivery dates. A limited number of shipbuilding contractors may meet this unique requirement including Electric Boat Corporation (EBC) and Huntington Ingalls Industries/Newport News Shipbuilding (HII/NNS). The contracted company would provide the necessary SPMT equipment to support aligning and welding the hull sections as well as experienced personnel including qualified operators to move, align, and weld the submarine hull sections.
 In addition to the hull butt welding services, NNSY is considering contracting for services to provide the following SPMT equipment to support all required SSN 701 and SSN 711 hull section and ACR raft movement and alignment conditions. The ROM should include providing the SPMT equipment and qualified personnel to operate the SPMTs for supporting the hull section movement and alignment conditions listed below. Seven hull section movements would be required per conversion. These hull sections will be supported by NNSY designed strongbacks which will need to interface with the provided Schuerle SPMTs. SPMT equipment required will include: (a) 3 schuerle power pack units type Z 350 DA or similar; (b) 9 Schuerle 6 axle heavy duty modular tranporters type PEKZ 210.12.4 or similar; (c) 3 Schuerle 4 axle heavy duty modular transporters type PEKZ 140.8.4 or similar; and (d) miscellaneous support equipment such as, but not limited to: remote control systems, side-by-side coupling blocks, and connection lines for both open and closed configuration operations.
 Hull section movement and alignment conditions are: initial hull separation = approximately 1771 tons and 111 feet in length (frame 47.5 forward), scrapped hull section = approximately 471 tons and 20 feet in length (frame 40.5 to 47.5), bulkhead shielded module = approximately 250 tons and 10 feet in length (plus transfer fixture and counterweight similar to VIRGINIA class), aft- and mid-operations = approximately 625 tons and 42 feet in length, ACR raft = approximately 425 tons and 24 feel in length (end loaded similar to VIRGINIA class command and control module), and forward-operations - approximately 1725 tons and 91 feet in length (re-populated frame 40.5 forward). Responses to this sources sought notice are due no later than 16 November 2012.
 This requirement may not result in a request for proposal.

3.	Anti-Armor  Integrated M220 TOW and M98A1 Javelin simulator capabilities and paring sensors into baseline system.
4.	Machine Guns - Integrated MK 19 Instrumented Weapon System (IWS) simulator, Small Arms Transmitter (SAT) and paring sensors into baseline system.
5.	Close Air Support  Provide a Forward Observer capability to effectively simulate call for fire and provide visual cues to the effect of the munitions.
  The effect will illustrate persistent CAS weapons impacts.  The capability will include audio recordings at the tactical radio for use in the AAR into the baseline system.
6.	Sniper Marksmanship - Integrated M107 long range sniper rifle (LRSR) and M110 semi-automatic sniper system (SASS)- SAT Sniper rifle capability, paring sensors and the Forward Observers use of existing Fire Control Devices while minimizing laser safety issues into baseline the system.
7.	Employ Munitions  Integrated M18A1 Claymore mine with integrated battlefield effects capabilities into the baseline system.

<DESC>In 2008, the Navy and Air Force initiated "technology match" workshops focusing on technology-based needs of individual major contractors. Since then, 18 major contractors have participated in individual Industry sponsored "technology match" workshops. As proven in previous SBIR CRP workshops, the technology-based needs concept is effective and beneficial to both the government and industry. The Air Force, through this process, has generated more than 100 SBIR Technology Transition Plans (STTP). This directly supports Congress's mandate to identify and accelerate technologies developed by small businesses participating in the SBIR program into Air Force acquisition programs. In response to these successes, DoD Components led by the Air Force are soliciting major contractors to participate in "technology match" workshops for 2013.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for the following existing contract requirement:
<p>In order to accomplish TSA's mission it is imperative that its employees and guests be provided a safe and secure environment in which to work. Therefore, it is essential that TSA's facilities be secured and protected. The Office of Security, Physical Security Division will accomplish this by contracting with a private security company to provide a safe and secure work environment for all employees and guests at TSA facilities in accordance with the minimum standards required for Government Contracted Security Guards developed by The Federal Protective Service (FPS), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security. In order to meet this need, TSA requires highly qualified, highly skilled security personnel to work in and around the TSA facilities in order to provide a deterrent against unauthorized, illegal, and potentially life-threatening activities directed toward TSA facilities, property, information, employees, and visitors.<br />Omniplex World Services is the only viable source that can provide continuity of services for an effective and efficient transition to the next contract as it is not feasible to compete the requirement for services required for this short period of time. Omniplex World Services has been the prime contractor since December 16, 2008. Their extensive security knowledge and familiarity with the requirement makes them the only practical contractor for this transition period. Additionally, the required TSA background (Entrance On Duty) determination could not be completed in time for another vendor to begin performance of this work. From a business perspective, the proposed 6 month extension on HSTS03-08-C-SEC088 can occur without start-up and transition costs that would be associated with bringing another contractor on board as no vendor has the resources, knowledge, and ability to perform this work immediately without passing along signification costs to the Government. <br />To prevent a lapse in this mission critical service, the government intends to modify the current contract number HSTS03-08-C-SEC088 to allow for an extension of services. This current contract ends November 9, 2012 and the two (2) three month bridge extensions would have a period of performance of November 10, 2012 and run thru May 9, 2013. It is the government's intent to modify the existing contract to extend the period of performance for an initial period of three months with a 3 month option periods to be utilized if needed. The extension will be performed under the same terms and conditions as the existing contract. The modification will be executed consistent with the basis of the authority provided in the contract terms and conditions under FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services<br />Accordingly, the TSA intends to modify Contract number HSTS03-08-C-SEC088 with Omniplex World Services, 14151 PARK MEADOW DR, SUITE 300 CHANTILLY VA 20151 for an extension of current services on a sole source basis. This contract modification will address the requirements of the TSA Personnel Security's Guard Services Support Requirement.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 52.217-8. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.<br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above vendor directly. This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available and telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Written challenges may be directed to Marlene Kratz via email at marlene.kratz@tsa.dhs.gov. If no responsive challenges are received by 11/06/2012, the contract modification will be executed with Omniplex World Services without further notice.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a solvent purification system. It was prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Requirements (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The solicitation number for this requirement is FA8601-13-P-0043 using FAR Subpart 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br />This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61, 13 September 2012.<br />This solicitation document is 100% Total Small Business set-aside under North American Industry Classification System Code 333249. Size standard is 500 employees.<br />The AFLCMC/PZIO Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirements:<br />CLIN 0001: Solvent Purification System</p>
<p>The required specifications for the multiple-solvent purifier:</p>
<p>1. Multiple solvent purification system for a minimum of seven (7) solvents. The system can populate between one to seven solvents. <br />o Single multiple-position dispensing valve (rather than multiple valves); 5-way dispensing valve or better.<br />o A single multiple-position dispensing valve, rather than a multi valve, eliminates the possibility of users pulling solvent through the vacuum pump and expelling it into a lab, which creates a safety hazard. <br />o This also eliminates cross-contamination problems that can be caused by user error, which is a consideration in this equipment's multi-user lab space.<br />o Dispensing valve must provide an automated feature in the design to eliminate the possibility of cross-contamination.<br />2. Equal to or greater than a 400 L capacity. <br />3. Isolation Valves (or an acceptable alternative) on top and bottom of column to aid in column switching and filter changes. Alternatives must not leak solvents when columns are changed. <br />4. Non-Teflon 24/40 dispensing joint for air tight seals. <br />o System should be capable of reducing water and oxygen in solvents to the low PPM levels and dispensing solvent into standard 24/40 ground joint glassware that excludes atmosphere.<br />o Teflon dispensing joints are unacceptable due to their tendency not to form air-tight seals with ground glass joints, which compromises solvent quality.<br />5. Metering valve to dispense precise amounts (&plusmn;5 mL) of solvent.<br />6. Grounding clamp to prevent Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) during refilling.<br />o A ground clamp for the solvent reservoir will greatly minimize the chance of fire due ESD while refilling volatile, flammable organic solvents.<br />7. Dimensions (Solvent Purifier and Flammable Storage Cabinet) are less than or equal to 62.0" W x 35" D x 85" H. Due to space limitations, dimensions cannot exceed these measurements. <br />Quantity: 1(one)<br />Unit of Issue: Each</p>

The draft solicitation is available on the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov/. The RFP Section J Attachments are contained in the secure package titled SPE600-13-9500. DLA Energy anticipates issuing the FINAL RFP in the near future but the final response date of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 6, 2013</span> will remain the same.<br /><br />DLA Energy will hold a Pre-Proposal Conference, we will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">update FBO with the exact date of the conference at a later time</span>. In order for interested parties to attend the Pre-Proposal Conference and/or Site Visits, please begin compiling the list of attendees and have them ready to submit to Yazmin.Mendoza@dla.mil, and/or Farheena.Khan@dla.mil once the Pre-Proposal Conference date is released. The DLA Energy Contracting Office will forward specific information regarding security requirements in order for vendors to obtain access onto Fort Polk, LA, once conference dates are established. <br /><br />Additionally, electronic copies of the Technical Library to include maps and technical data will be made available to offerors to the maximum extent possible. The Technical Library information will be available at the Pre-proposal Conference for those interested parties that request a copy and already obtained a Joint Certification Program (JCP) certification (see below note regarding registering for JCP certification) no later than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 16, 2012</span>. Please be advised that only one copy of the Technical Library will be available per company. Non-disclosure agreements may be required by the Installation, and if required, will be provided to offerors when registering for the pre-proposal conference. For those interested parties that are not able to attend the Pre-Proposal Conference and/or Site Visit, please submit a request to the individuals in the paragraph above, and provide the company mailing address where FedEx packages can be received and we will mail you a copy of the Technical Library. <br /><br /><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> To access the secured documents on the FBO website, all vendors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) first and foremost. If you are registered in SAM, once you click on the secured document link in the FBO, it should prompt you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form, in order to complete the JCP certification. All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well. For any additional questions or help, please visit the FBO Help Desk, which can be reached at https://www.fsd.gov/app/answers/list or by calling 1-866-606-8220.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />If you are not registered in SAM, you will need to register. SAM is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/. Vendors must also request and be approved for explicit access to each solicitation in order to view the secure packages. For any additional questions or help, please visit the SAM Help Desk which can be accessed by selecting the Help Tab at the top of the SAM homepage.</span>

<p>Quote Submission:</p>
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation is NOT the entire RFQ.  To receive a copy of the entire RFQ (ITO, Evaluation Factors, etc), please see the instructions below.  FAILURE TO FOLLOW these instructions will NOT constitute a reason to grant an extension to the RFQ period at a later date.</p>
<p>All interested Offerors must submit their quote via GSA's IT Solution Shop (ITSS) web-based order processing system.  Quotes will only be received and awarded via ITSS.  The link is listed below and the ITSS Help Desk number is 1-877-243-2889.  ITSS webpage is https://web.itss.gsa.gov/Login.</p>
<p>Offerors shall use ITSS to receive the entire RFQ and submit its quote.   THE DOCUMENTS IN ITSS ARE THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS TO BE USED FOR SOLICITATION. To receive the entire RFQ, and submit a quote for consideration for award, all interested Offerors send GSA an email identifying (1) vendor's name, and (2) the name of an individual Offeror employee who will act as the Offeror's GSA point of contact (POC) for this requirement that is "registered in IT Solution Shop (ITSS)".  OFFERORS MUST IDENTIFY THE COMPANY NAME OF THE OFFEROR AND THE POC'S NAME EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS IN ITSS.  "Registered in ITSS" or "Registration in ITSS" means a Offeror is successfully registered in ITSS such that the Government can select Vendor's designated POC in ITSS to receive the RFQ, view an order, and be able to submit a quote.  Some Offerors have multiple company divisions and employees registered in ITSS making it difficult for GSA selection.  Therefore, to ensure that all interested Offerors receive the RFQ, prompt submission of the above ITSS vendor information (Offeror's name and POC) is requested.  An email shall be sent to mildred.burress@gsa.gov and bernard.fordham@gsa.gov  in order to receive RFQ via ITSS.  You may also contact Mildred Burress at (769) 203-9309 or Bernard Fordham at 228-813-4875.  This will ensure that potential Offeror receive a copy of the RFQ and have the opportunity to submit a quote.  The quote closing date in ITSS is 11:00 am on November 19, 2012 (EST).  Extension to the RFQ closing date and time will not be granted due to late registration in ITSS or not being registered in ITSS.  Any quote received by GSA after the closing date/time is late and shall not be evaluated and will not be considered for award.</p>

<p>ROTOR. The generator rotor consists of a rotor core, six field coils and a collector ring assembly. The rotor core is of the salient type construction and has six poles. It is attached to the shaft by means of a key and a shrink ring. The preformed field coils are placed over the poles and are held in place by a coil compression assembly, coil braces and pole head pieces. Each pole head piece is secured to the rotor core by special high strength socket head screws which are secured to a rod running axially through the length of each pole. Fans are attached to the pole head pieces at each end of the rotor core to circulate cooling air within the generator enclosure. The field coils are wound on a precision form with thixotropic varnish applied between turns, then cured at the required temperature in an enclosure form to the required shape. Additional details of field coil construction and connections are shown and described in reference 2.1 figure 3-34. The collector ring assembly provides the means of connection to the two leads of the field coil. The assembly is held in place on the rotor shaft by a key, while the bearing pedestal supports the brush rigging over the collector rings.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The solicitation number for this acquisition is NIAID-NOI13-D1610405 and is being issued as a Notice of Intent to procure on a sole source basis the below listed items. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intend to procure under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 811219; which has a business size standard of 7.0M; This requirement is for a Renewal Maintenance Service Contract for (1) FACSAria II Special (NO LASERS), Serial Number P46900095; (1) SAPPHIRE 488-100 Blue Laser, Serial Number NO-SERIAL-3594; (1) Laser COHR Cube 640-40 Red, Serial Number NO-SERIAL-3595; (1) Laser CUBE 405-50C Violet, Serial Number NO-SERIAL-3596. These instruments are manufactured by BD Biosciences; and BD Biosciences is the only vendor with the requisite parts inventory and technical expertise to meet our requirements which has the qualifications to repair and maintain the equipment and includes the following: The following factors for the analysis to be reliable and timely: 1) Labor, travel expenses and parts (excluding consumables), 2) 2 preventative maintenance inspections to be performed during a 12-month period, 3) 2 PM kits will be provided, 4) Software revisions released during the agreement term, 5) Unlimited service visits, M-F, excluding BD holidays, 6) Unlimited telephone support for instruments, reagents and applications will be provided at no additional charge, and 7) 48-hour guaranteed response to a request for emergency on-site service (Monday - Friday, excluding BD holidays. The BD FACS ARIA II is an essential part of the ongoing research mission for Dr. Jason Brenchley's laboratory. In order for the instrument to be serviced correctly, efficiently, and under warranty a Service Contract Renewal needs to be done with BD Biosciences. The service by the BD trained technicians will also guarantee optimal operation of the FACS ARIA II system because parts and supplies are readily available to the service technicians. Replacing any one of the lasers on this instrument costs approximately $5,000. These lasers have been known to go out with some frequency in BD flow cytometer earlier models. Due to these issues it is necessary that BD Biosciences is the preferred source. All repair personnel must be certified by the manufacturer to perform maintenance on the equipment to avoid risk or loss of warranty; for the service contract renewal for our FACS ARIA II.

<DESC>NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECT<br />GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Design Architect <br />C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation # GS-05P-12-GB-C-0027
<p>Region: Great Lakes (5)<br />City: Chicago<br />State: Illinois<br />Contracting Officer: David Mazzolini<br />Phone Number: 312-353-0617</p>
<p>PROJECT: NASA Research Support Building, Cleveland, Ohio<br />BUILDING TYPE: New Federal Office Building<br />CLIENT AGENCY: NASA<br />SIZE: 100,000 gross square feet<br />BUDGET: $15 to $20 million<br />FUNDING: Funds Are Not Currently Available</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, the facility will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. The project will be at a minimum LEED Gold.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />This project is for the new construction of a building for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in accordance with their Repair by Replacement program.  The project will require the demolition of an existing building, and in its place, creation of a new three-story Research Support Building of approximately 100,000 gross square feet (GSF).  NASA is in the process of creating a new centralized downtown campus area at Lewis Field with the Research Support Building being at its new central hub.  The Research Support building will house support offices such as a credit union, cafeteria, etc on the first floor and federal office space on the 2nd and 3rd floors.  The proposed building will be located at NASA's Glenn Research Center (GRC) located on Lewis Field in Cleveland, Ohio.  This new project will need to be responsive to NASA's overall campus and master plan and is adjacent to a National Register Historic District.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, BIM, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), LEED administration, and post-construction contract services (PCCS) for the new three-story Research Support Building. The project is also to include GSA design standards and NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including at a minimum LEED Gold requirements; and customer agency requirements.</p>
<p>SELECTION PROCESS<br />This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.

<p>Justification for Other Than Full And Open Competition</p>
<p><br />1. Agency and contracting activity:</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN).</p>
<p>2. Nature/description of the action being approved:</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard C3CEN Electronics Repair Facility (ERF) has a requirement for the purchase of automated test software to drive our new National Instruments PXI automated tester, to be used immediately for troubleshooting and repair of the following::<br />(a) 378' Class "Propulsion" circuit cards<br />(b) 110' A/B Class "Start Panel" circuit cards<br />(c) 110' C Class "Alarm" circuit cards<br />(d) 110' A/B/C Class "Liquid Level Alarm" circuit cards<br />(e) Assorted SRAN circuit cards<br />(f) HHF ERG III circuit cards<br />.<br />3. Description of supplies/services:</p>
<p>A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of: one (1) "NI Developer Suite", P/N 779601-35, configured with one (1) "NI Developer Suite Automated Test Option," P/N 779602-35 as per the National Instruments quote # 1717707; manufactured by National Instruments, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>Total Estimated Value: $7,800.00</p>
<p>4. Identification of the justification and the rationale:</p>
<p>This statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2), "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited:</p>
<p>This National Instruments Developer Suite Core and Options (Automated Test) purchase is the software the ERF requires for our second National Instruments PXI test system. Our first PXI system has this exact software package installed and it has been successful. The newly acquired PXI automated tester has to match our original automated tester in hardware and software configuration, so that the code written on one PXI may be successfully deployed to the other PXI with a confident expectation of identical outcomes in all our circuit card tests. It is not allowable to share this software across multiple PXI devices, so a software license from National Instruments is required for each machine. Only by utilizing hardware and software from National Instruments are we guaranteed to have no configuration conflicts; allowing us to concentrate on our core mission of circuit card repair.</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:</p>
<p>A Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be posted on FedBizOps with the statement that any interested offerors that feel they can provide these items as listed may provide a quote.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine fair and reasonableness based on competition on FEDBIZOPS.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research:</p>
<p>Market research revealed there are other distributor's for National Instrument Products.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>The Coast Guard's decision to use the National Instruments PXI system was made in late October 2008, when LSU ordered a $41,000.00 PXI system. Upon the closing of LSU, we obtained this system from them via 1149, ordered the plug in modules and software needed to upgrade the unit to our specifications, and began to write automated tests for our circuit cards. We have been successful to date because National Instruments provides outstanding after- purchase support through their web site, discussion forums, regular software updates, engineer help lines and on-site tech assist visits. We believe we will be successful in the future because we buy test equipment that meets our needs today and will surpass our expectations tomorrow. The U.S. Coast Guard made a wise choice to invest in National Instruments products back in 2008, and we wish to continue ensuring future success by using the products which have proven to be successful.</p>
<p><br />10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:</p>
<p>None at this time <br />11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services required:</p>
<p>None at this time</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification:</p>
<p>I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.<br /><br />James A. Lassiter<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p>(13) Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Government's minimum need and the supporting data which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum, respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested, your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number).

Failure to be properly registered at the time and date of closing will render the quote non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Douglas Lowrey, at douglas.lowrey@us.army.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Mr. Daniyar Tuleshov<br />Deputy Director<br />Resource Base Management Department<br />JSC KazTransGas&nbsp;<br />12/1 Kunayev Street<br />Astana 010000<br />Kazakhstan</p>
<p>Phone: +77172552311<br />Fax: +77172552366<br />E-Mail:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:D.tuleshov@kaztransgas.kz">D.tuleshov@kaztransgas.kz</a></p>
<br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to determine the economic, technical and financial feasibility of an integrated production and processing project for helium, nitrogen and natural gas.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Grantee, JSC KazTransGas, is a subsidiary of KazMunayGas, the state-owned national oil and gas company, which is itself a subsidiary of the state-owned holding company Samruk-Kazyna. KazTransGas' primary lines of business are gas transmission and distribution; however, the company is also involved with gas production.</p>
<p>KazTransGas has ownership of significant deposits of nitrogen-helium and nitrogen-methane located in southern Kazakhstan. KTG plans to develop an integrated gas project to produce methane, nitrogen, and helium from the deposits. The full KazTransGas Integrated Gas Production and Processing project would entail production and processing of the helium, as well as potential utilization of the methane and significant nitrogen content for development of value added products such as ammonia and fertilizer by off-takers.</p>
<p>The project would involve exploration and production of the gas reserves, as well as processing and transport of the gasses. It would include construction of a field processing unit, a cryogenic gas processing plant to separate out methane, nitrogen and helium, and transport of the purified gasses to off-takers. The infrastructure within the area is well suited to the needs of the project, including: active natural gas production in the area, several fertilizer plants within a hundred kilometers of the site, connection to the national gas pipeline system, and good road and rail infrastructure. A pre-feasibility study of the project indicated that the project is likely to be profitable. KTG needs this feasibility study to further prove the economics of the project sufficient to make investment decisions and potentially obtain debt financing.</p>
<p>As such, the purpose of this study is to assess the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of the exploration, extraction, and processing of helium, methane, and nitrogen from existing gas fields in the Zhambyl region of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>KTG is looking for a firm who is also interested in follow-on involvement as co-investor and/or operator.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $626,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English&nbsp;and eight (8) copies&nbsp;directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM, November 27, 2012</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>	QUESTION	GOVERNMENT ANSWER
1.	Can the government confirm that the bulleted list of actionable items identified in each of these tasks are expected to be addressed by the contractor for each period of performance based on the labor hours allotted in each period?  For example, a-n bullets are repeated for each period so is it up to the contractor to determine which of the tasks, and how many, it will cover in the base period 160 hours and address the other tasks in each of the follow-on periods as the hours allow?  This would mean the bulk of the work would be completed in Option Period 2 - Year 3 where the majority of the development hours are allocated.	The contract states that the contractor shall budget for a minimum of 160 hours allocated for usability report modifications during the base year.  The contractor shall work with the VA program office to determine what tasks can be feasibly completed in the base year.  Whatever remaining modifications are not completed may be worked on during the option periods.  Also, the VA's usability analysis of MVC is ongoing, so suggested modifications may be updated prior to Option Year 1 and 2.      
2.	References to task 44 and 45 are made, can the government confirm the referenced are intended to describe Tasks 1.25 and 1.26?	Yes, task 44 & task 45 are intended to describe Tasks 1.25 & 1.26.
3.	Can the government provide an estimation of the total volume of content it anticipates to provide for each period of performance?	At this point the way the government provides training is shifting so we anticipate increasing the content in MyVeHU Campus drastically over the next few years.  Our baseline for the past 10 months has been adding 10-15 hours of training per month. We anticipate this increasing by 400% over the next 3 years.  
4.	Can the Government confirm whether a Low NACI clearance will, or will not, be required for performance of the tasks described?  	It will be required.   
5.	Volume III - Price Factor indicates that the price proposal shall be submitted in "EXCEL format".  Is this intended to describe format only and a PDF of the Excel format will suffice or does the Government expect to receive an actual Excel file of the price proposal?	A PDF of the Excel format will suffice.
6. 	Who is the incumbent?	Image Technical Services
7.	Several tasks listed as based year tasks state final task delivery date 36 months following dated of award. Please confirm the period of performance for all tasks in base year as 12 months following date of award.
	The complete list of tasks in base year is due by 12 months after award date.   We certainly expect to work with the vendor to deliver a phased development approach so that we are increasing functionality incrementally throughout the year.     
8.	There is no reference in the SOW to base year hosting. Is there a hosting solution already in place for the base year? If so, who is hosting? If not, will there be an addendum to the SOW?	The incumbent vendor is hosting for the base year.     
9.	What is the development platform?	The development for MVC currently uses Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 4.0 with the Razor View Engine. Advanced versions of the following technologies, patterns and techniques are also used:

C#, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML / HTML5 CSS/CSS3, AJAX , SQL Server 2008 R2, MVC Pattern, Mobile Development Targeting, Adaptive Rendering

MVC is programmed to a distributed cloud infrastructure in combination with a CDN, so knowledge of direct manipulation of CDN distributed caching is part of the infrastructure technology development requirements. This is critical for scalability.
10.	Task 1.21 specifies Maintenance as needed for both modalities - what are these modalities?	Desktop and Mobile Solutions
11.	Task 1.22 Tech Support - What is the total user population? How many anticipated users would need tech support?	The total user population is around 100,000 clinical users. We cannot anticipate how many will require tech support.   
12.	Technical Volume requirements state:
Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (i.e. a completed GPAT or VPAT or equivalent) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.
-	How can this be completed for a product that has not been developed? 
-	Is the Government looking for a COTS solution? 	The government is not looking for a COTS solution.   The government is looking for enhancements to the custom developed solution.   If a completed GPAT or VPAT is not available the proposal must document the vendor's past capabilities to provide desktop and mobile web development that provides virtual conferencing and e-learning that has met all 508 requirements.

EPIC will be aligned with GPO's Strategic Plan for FY 2012-2016 and the agency's Enterprise Architecture (EA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will also integrate with evolving enterprise-wide systems, including GPO's Business Information System (GBIS) and other future enterprise systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The objectives of EPIC are as follows:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0pt" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To implement a system that maximizes Customer Services' print procurement workflow efficiency to provide more timely service and ultimately reduce administrative costs.</li>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">Throughout its history, the Customer Services department has carried out its mission utilizing predominately manual processes with information organized in a now aging mainframe system. The material submitted to Customer Services by Federal customers represents order information that impacts stakeholders throughout the print procurement process (such as Financial Management, and GPO's Library and Sales Programs). As such, the current process introduces inefficiencies such as duplication of effort (multiple keying of same data) and creates multiple opportunities for error during translation of order information from paper submissions by customers to GPO-generated specifications, award and post-award documents, etc. In this process, pertinent information about the order must be passed to other processes within the print procurement workflow which further perpetuates errors and inefficiencies. Current systems constrain transparency within the overall workflow and tracking information is fragmented across multiple systems, which impacts the real-time sharing of information and job tracking data. </span></p>

<p>The Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Contamination Indication/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS) Program will host a Pre-Solicitation Conference to inform and solicit input from industry regarding the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the CIDAS. This Pre-Solicitation Conference will be conducted from 0900 - 1400 on 8 November 2012 in the Aberdeen Proving Ground&nbsp;- Edgewood, Maryland area. The location and facility for this conference is Building E3330, Room 134, located on Ricketts Point Road, Edgewood, MD.&nbsp; For a map and directions to this facility, please go to <a href="https://www.ecbc.army.mil/about/mapdir.html">https://www.ecbc.army.mil/about/mapdir.html</a></p>
<p>Following the Pre-Solicitation Conference, an opportunity will be afforded to attendees for 15 minute one-on-one discussions with the CIDAS Product Manager. The discussions will be held on 8 November from 1400-1700 at the same general location as the Pre-Solicitation Conference. Interested companies may register for one-on-one discussions at the Pre-Solicitation Conference. Due to the limited amount of time available, one-on-one discussion time slots will be given to interested companies in the order in which they are received until no more slots are available, no exceptions.</p>
<p>Interested companies must pre-register no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012 as follows:<br />Request for attendance must be sent via e-mail to Mrs. Kelly Conerly at kelly.y.conerly@navy.mil and Ms. Amanda Yocum at amanda.l.yocum@us.army.mil. Due to conference facility size, attendance is limited. Your request must include the company name, contact person, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and the names of the representatives planning to attend. Attendance is not mandatory and will not affect your eligibility to submit an RFP offer.</p>
<p>For security purposes, all interested companies must submit, ON COMPANY LETTERHEAD, the following information: <br />Company Name, Address <br />Subject: Contamination Indication Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS) Pre-Solicitation Conference Participation, 8 November 2012<br />Contact Person, Address, Phone Number, Fax Number, Email Address <br />Name(s) of attendee(s), Phone Number(s), Email Address(es)<br />The letter must be e-mailed to Ms. Conerly and Ms. Yocum at the e-mail addresses above no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012.</p>
<p>All attendees from outside the United States must submit the International Visitor Information Form and supporting documentation as a requirement to participate in the Pre-Solicitation Conference and one-on-one discussions. The International Visitor Information Form and supporting documentation must be e-mailed to Ms. Conerly and Ms. Yocum at the e-mail addresses above no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012.</p>
<p>Detailed information regarding the Pre-Solicitation Conference, including agenda, directions, conference facility and accommodations will be posted when the exact location is announced. It is incumbent upon interested parties to monitor this posting for updated information.</p>
<p>Draft RFP: <br />The draft RFP for the CIDAS program is posted in the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov for solicitation W911QY-13-R-0001.</p>
<p>Send questions and comments regarding the draft RFP to Ms. Jean Greenwood at jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil with a courtesy copy to Mr. Peter Wallace at peter.j.wallace6.civ@mail.mil no later than 1530 hours EDT 1 November 2012. Questions received regarding the draft RFP will be discussed at a planned Q&amp;A session during the Pre-Solicitation Conference.</p>
<p>Contamination Indication/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS):<br />The goal of CIDAS is to provide the Warfighter a capability that not only detects trace levels of chemical warfare agents on surfaces before and/or after a decontamination operation, but also visually indicates the exact location of that contamination and provides significant utility during Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) operations. This technology will afford Warfighters the ability to accurately map the area of disseminated contamination on equipment and quickly determine if a given area is (or is not) contaminated. This technology has unique benefits, such as isolating "hot spots" from "clean spots" on surfaces and visibly indicating whether standard decontamination procedures performed were successful. Given the capability to visibly indicate contaminant location on a surface, DED personnel will be able to focus decontamination efforts on the localized threat, therefore dramatically reducing manpower, water requirements, decontaminant requirements and exposure hazard to Warfighters performing DED while increasing decontamination efficiency. The CIDAS must be compatible with a wide range of materiel and facilities to avoid degrading readiness and capabilities due to damage from the application of indicant.</p>
<p>Refer to the Draft RFP for additional information and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties for participating in the pre-solicitation conference or responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers -- October 31, 2012<br /><br />Q: Are utility bills managed and paid at each facility or centrally at IHS HQ? <br />A: Some bills are managed at the facility level and others at the Area level. None at the Headquarters level.<br /><br />Q: Does IHS require a utility management system to capture and manage all utility data or just need services to enter/upload utility data into EPA's Portfolio Manager? <br />A: We would like an estimation for both, but we only REQUIRE Portfolio Manager for now. <br /><br />Q: How does IHS currently manage utility bill data? <br />A: We require annual reporting from the facilities. But each area/facility does this differently.<br />

The existing Concession Contract between the NPS and the Prior Concessioner is set to expire January 31, 2013.  The Director, pursuant to 36 C.F.R.

Any proposals must be received by the National Park Service, Pacific West Region, Attn: Commercial Services Office, 333 Bush Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, California  94104.

Checks or money orders (no cash or credit cards accepted) must be payable to the National Park Service; and you must include a business address (no post office box) to receive a Federal Express package.
Prospectus packages will be available by contacting Trystan Stern, Commercial Services Analyst, Pacific West Region, via email to Trystan_Stern@nps.gov.  The Prospectus will also be available after October 31, 2012, at http://concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm.  If you choose to retrieve a copy of the Prospectus from the NPS website please notify Trystan Stern via email, so you are placed on the mailing list to receive notifications of any future modifications or other correspondence.
A one-day site visit is scheduled for November 8, 2012.

<DESC>This synopsis/pre-solicitation notice modification for non-commercial supplies has a change only to the quantity-all other information remains the same.  The Response Date is still Nov 08, 2012.


This is a synopsis/pre-solicitation notice for non-commercial supplies. It is intended to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Integrated Procurement Technologies (IPT).  

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) Philadelphia has established a requirement for the listed Integrated Procurement Technologies (IPT) to provide the following commercial supplies: 396 electrical solenoids (Part Number 197967-001 Deluge Valve Solenoids, SCN).

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.
 Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and does not constitute a solicitation. However, all proposals received prior to the closing date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Upon its release, the solicitation will be made available electronically at https://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://neco.navy.mil.
 A hard copy of the solicitation will not be made available. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.

<DESC><br />This project is 100% Set Aside for Small Business<br /><br />Project Description: Construction services include strengthening a 3,380-foot section of the Bradley Canyon Levee, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Santa Barbara County, CA</strong></span>. The levee will be strengthened by two methods: installing a steel combi-wall and constructing a soil cement revetment. The new combi-wall will connect to an existing combi-wall and will be installed at the crest of the Bradley Canyon levee along a 1,000-foot section. The combi-wall consists of king piles and sheet piles. The king piles and sheet piles will be driven to depths of approximately 64 feet and 52 feet, respectively. The upstream end of the combi-wall will overlap with the downstream end of the soil cement revetment. The soil cement revetment will be constructed against the existing levee at a slope of 2 horizontal: 1 vertical and have a width of 8 feet. The soil cement will extend approximately 2,380 feet and will have a vertical height of approximately 30 feet. Approximately 19 feet of the soil cement height will be buried. A section of the Bradley Canyon levee will be raised with compacted fill by a maximum 1.6 feet. The existing low flow will be diverted during construction and restored after construction is completed.<br /><br />The estimated cost of this project is $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.<br /><br />ALL OFFERORS/BIDDERS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS. <br /><br />ORDERING SOLICITATION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solicitation will be available on-line on or&nbsp;about&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">16 NOVEMBER 2012</span></strong>.

<DESC>United States Marine Corps effort for systems capability upgrades to Live training Gaps within the Squad Immersive Training Environment (SITE). The Live training toolkit baseline system is Instrumented Tactical Engagement Simulation System II (I-TESS II). The capability enhancements are not currently available within the I-TESS II toolkit. This effort includes all Program Management, Engineering, Testing, and Logistics tasks associated with developing the capability upgrades. In addition to the development of the system capabilities a verification of the training systems to meet the SITE capability gaps will be conducted upon completion of development. The system upgrades will conform to the Instrumented- Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) specification and ensure compliance with the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA). CTIA is the foundational architecture for the Live Training Transformation Family of Training Systems (LT2-FTS) strategy. CTIA consists of standard architecture services, components and protocols, and it facilitates commonality across the various training instrumentation systems and interoperability across Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) and joint training environments. The Government seeks suitable commercial items, developmental items, or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements.
<p>The SITE specific capability enhancements are as follow:<br />1. Mortars - Integrate mortar firing capability, paring sensors, ballistic computer, and forward observer device (M224, 60mm and M252, 81mm) into baseline system.<br />2. Assault-Squads - Integrated MK153 shoulder launched multipurpose assault weapon (SMAW) simulator capability, paring sensors, day/night sighting, and back blast mechanism (non-pyrotechnic) into baseline system.<br />3. Anti-Armor - Integrated M220 TOW and M98A1 Javelin simulator capabilities and paring sensors into baseline system.<br />4. Machine Guns - Integrated MK 19 Instrumented Weapon System (IWS) simulator, Small Arms Transmitter (SAT) and paring sensors into baseline system.<br />5. Close Air Support - Provide a Forward Observer capability to effectively simulate call for fire and provide visual cues to the effect of the munitions. The effect will illustrate persistent CAS weapons impacts. The capability will include audio recordings at the tactical radio for use in the AAR into the baseline system.<br />6. Sniper Marksmanship - Integrated M107 long range sniper rifle (LRSR) and M110 semi-automatic sniper system (SASS)- SAT Sniper rifle capability, paring sensors and the Forward Observers use of existing Fire Control Devices while minimizing laser safety issues into baseline the system.</p>

If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>I-Suite is the principle software application which supports core business functions for incident management. The I-Suite Application has been a Nationally Supported application since 2001. I-Suite is considered to be in the Operation and Maintenance Phase of the software lifecycle. One maintenance release is deployed annually along with minor patch releases on an as required basis.<br />In 2006, the Incident Based Automation (IBA) Project Team was chartered to reengineer/technically refresh the I-Suite Application. The resulting application known as Enterprise I-Suite (eI-Suite) will serve the business community into the future. The eI-Suite application will provide similar functionality to the I-Suite Application but will incorporate new software technology.<br />The first phase of eI-Suite development began in June 2010 with completion in June 2012. Phase two of development will result in the completion and deployment of eI-Suite.
<p>eI-Suite Application Overview</p>
<p>At a high level, the reengineered application will incorporate: Browser-based technology Reengineered User Interface and Supporting Database Structure Updated business processes and enhancements including the ability to support business practices for a much broader range of incident types beyond those of wildland fire Ability to support incident level (Site) and field office (Enterprise) operations Integration with the National Enterprise Support System (NESS) Application Security Portal (NAP). See Attachment IV for a description of NAP.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a noncompetitive follow-on Delivery Order with the Avaya Government Solutions, Inc. under GSA Schedule GS-35F-4366G for the augmentation of the existing Jason-2 Ground System to enable support for the operations of both the Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellites. This augmented Ground System is referred to as the NOAA Jason Ground System (NJGS). The anticipated noncompetitive award shall be for one base year with two one-year option periods. The Government anticipates that the base period will commence on or about December 1, 2012 through November 30, 2013. The total period of performance shall not exceed 36 months.
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Environment Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS, in conjunction with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and France's Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), has decided to launch the Jason-3 mission as a follow-on to the Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM/Jason-2). The primary objective of this upcoming radar altimetry mission is to provide precise sea surface height measurements for determining global sea-level rise, ocean currents, and upper ocean heat content with equal or better performance than Jason-2. This project's objective is to complete the development, testing and implementation of the Jason Ground System to support the simultaneous operations of both the Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellites. The augmented ground system is referred to as the NOAA Jason Ground System (NJGS) and is currently being developed by the NJGS incumbent contractor, Avaya Government Solutions, Inc. under the United States Department of Commerce contract DG133E11NC0168, which was originally competed.</p>
<p>The following activities are some of the items to be performed by the contractor according to the Jason Ground System Mission Operations Support Performance Work Statement (PWS):<br />NJGS Acceptance Tests - Following completion of onsite integration and test activities, the contractor shall conduct a series of formal Acceptance Tests at each site (1. NSOF; 2. Wallops; 3. Fairbanks and 4. Darrow) to verify the functionality and performance of the NJGS. The acceptance tests will consist of a series of component acceptance tests, followed by an end-to-end NJGS acceptance test. <br />4-Partner Verification and Validation - Following the completion of end-to-end acceptance testing, the NJGS will enter a period of verification and validation by the four (4) Jason-3 partners (NASA, NOAA, CNES, and EUMETSAT). The verification and validation phase of the program will consist of four major activities including Four-Partner Compatibility Testing, Four-Partner Technical Qualification, Four-Partner Operational Qualification, and Four-Partner End-to-End Testing. <br />These activities will be conducted at both Command Data Acquisition Stations (CDAS) sites and at the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC), and will demonstrate the compatibility of the NJGS with the interfaces and requirements of the external partners, as well as the ability of NJGS to support four-partner operations with both Jason-2 and Jason-3 spacecrafts. The contractor shall provide full support of each testing and qualification activity during the 4-partner verification and validation phase of the program.<br />Transition to Operations - Following the successful completion of the 4-partner verification and validation phase, the contractor shall support the transition of the operations and maintenance of the NJGS to NOAA personnel. The transition will include a range of training activities that will ensure that NOAA operations personnel have the knowledge necessary to fully operate and maintain every element of the NJGS. Transition to operations includes transitioning the current Jason-2 operations to NJGS operations. This transition shall be carried out such that it will have no impact to the continuing day-to-day operations of Jason-2.<br />In the occurrence that Jason-2 is transitioned into NJGS prior to the Jason-3 launch, the Contractor shall support the transition of Jason-2 to NJGS system hardware, software, and network configuration, which may have to be modified to support the simultaneous operation of Jason-2 and the testing of NJGS. This will include a refresh of certain ground system hardware. While the NJGS is being tested and Jason-2 operations are concurrently being performed using NJGS the system shall be designed to ensure that the Jason-2 operational data and the Jason-2 test data are isolated from each other.<br />Training and Documentation - The contractor shall ensure that NOAA personnel are adequately trained in all aspects of NJGS operations, maintenance, and management. A key objective of our knowledge transfer efforts is to ensure that NOAA personnel are able to operate the NJGS independently of ongoing support from the Avaya Government Team, enabling a successful transition to full NOAA responsibility for the NJGS. Contractor shall complete all documentation according to the NJGS Contract Deliverable Requirements List (CDRL).</p>
<p>Hardware and Software Maintenance - The contractor shall perform maintenance (including repair) of all installed hardware on all equipment throughout the contract's period of performance. This support includes security hardening of hardware components. The contractor shall retain full responsibility for maintenance of newly installed software following acceptance testing. Software maintenance support shall be provided on a 24x7 on-call basis.</p>
<p>IT Security - The contractor shall support the NOAA Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) activities and the implementation of NJGS security controls using methods described in NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems; NIST SP 800-53, Revision 3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems; and guidance from Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems. The contractor shall ensure that system components meet the applicable security control requirements for high-impact systems as defined in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 3. Furthermore, the contractor shall support and participate in the security controls assessment by validating the management, operational, and technical controls of the NJGS in accordance with NIST SP 800-53A, as well as assist in the development of documentation artifacts including but not limited to the System Security Plan (SSP), Contingency Plan (CP), and Security Test and Evaluation Plan (STP).</p>
<p>International Partners - This task carries with it an International partnering component for the United States where NOAA is keeping up with the implementation schedule established by NOAA and its international partners. Because NOAA is working with France's CNES Space Program and the European Union's EUMETSAT Program for Meteorological Satellites, a change in Contractor would cause a ripple effect in the schedules of all three organizations with both national and international consequences. <br />Jason-2 Satellite and Ground System near end-of-life -The existing Jason-2 ground system is quickly approaching its end of life due to hardware obsolescence and ageing equipment. The most likely scenario is that the operations of the Jason-2 satellite will be transitioned to NJGS prior to the launch of the Jason-3 satellite. Hence a change in Contractor will not only affect the readiness and launch of the future Jason-3 satellite but will also negatively impact the operations of the existing Jason-2 satellite and associated transition to NJGS.</p>
<p>Availability of launch vehicle - Currently NOAA through NASA/KSC (Kennedy Space Center) has contracted with Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) to launch the Jason-3 satellite. If Jason-3 launch is delayed beyond the contractually-agreed launch date in December 2014, the satellite will be removed from SpaceX launch manifest. The new launch date will have to be negotiated and it would also incur additional costs. Schedule delays based on use of a new Contractor show a potential launch readiness date of January 2016.</p>
<p>Avaya Government Solutions has been involved from the inception of the Jason-3 mission ground system implementation with the planning, design, implementation, and integration and testing at the NOAA operational facilities. Avaya's intricate knowledge of the system configuration, software code and hardware would be difficult for any other Contractor to simply transition into at expert integration level. This task will start in the middle stages of ground system integration and award to another Contractor produces tremendous risk to the program that will result in schedule delays and a lack of proper training. Avaya is the only source capable of providing the unique and specialized services required for the completion of NJGS in preparation for Jason-3 launch due to their unique knowledge and hands-on expertise of the NJGS system configuration; Jason-2/Jason-3 telemetry and commanding; ground system software and hardware; specialized operational environment at NOAA facilities; Jason-2/Jason-3 Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) and associated Security Testing and Evaluation (ST&amp;E); NJGS Data Communications Network (DCN) infrastructure; and external telecommunication interfaces with the other 4-partners.</p>
<p>The success of the project relies on the success of each component, and the implementation of the satellite ground system is a key part of this project. This is also the only part of the project that is faced with any delay in schedule. Being that the NJGS ground system components are currently being integrated and tested at the various NOAA operational facilities, award to another Contractor would produce a tremendous risk to the program and the readiness for Jason-3 launch.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by NOAA. Any submission must be received not later than 15 calendar days from the date of the posting of this announcement. Any response must include sufficient information to allow the government to evaluate its capability relative to the technical requirements stated herein. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion. Responses are to be submitted to Robin.Prather@noaa.gov. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.</p>

The VMEC consists of Compact Disk/Digital Video Disk Rewritable (CD/DVD-RW) unit and a floppy drive.  The VMEC, ruggedized, forced air-cooled chassis.  The VMEC is equipped with a low noise 800 watt power supply and three (3) backplanes supporting a 40 Mb/sec VME bus that supports up to 18 typical VME (6U x 160mm) CCAs compliant with IEEE1014.  The first backplane has six (6) slots, the second backplane has seven (7) slots, and the third backplane has five (5) slots.  The VMEC is designed to use slide mounts and can be mounted in a standard 19-inch equipment cabinet.  The VMEC utilizes 115 Volts Alternating Current (Vac), 60 Hertz (Hz), single phase electrical MIL- STD-1399 section 300, type I power, as received through the UPS.  The chassis is cooled using three (3) front panel fans and three (3) chassis fans, located on the bottom of the VMEC card cage, that draw air in from the front of the unit and exhaust air through the rear of the unit.  An air intake filter is located in the front panel. The original chassis was fielded on US Navy platforms under C- 12509C/USC-39(V) nomenclature.  Procurement of this equipment from another source would require the time involved for the source to conduct research, design, and manufacturing of the assemblies; well beyond the manufacturing lead time of 28 weeks of the current source.
