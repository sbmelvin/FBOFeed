<a href="mailto:todd.pennington@faa.gov">todd.pennington@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy Paragraph T3.2.2.4 (Single-Source Selection), the FAA proposes to award a single source contract extension of the Voice Switching and Control System (VSCS) contract, DTFAWA-07-C-00014, for the period of January 2015 through December 2018 to the Harris Corporation-USA, Inc., Government Communications Systems Division, P.O. Box 9800, Melbourne, Florida.
	The purpose of this extension is to assure continued, uninterrupted, state-of-the-art Air-to-Ground (A/G) and Ground-to-Ground (G/G) telecommunication capabilities of all air traffic monitored and/or controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration using VSCS and the VSCS Training and Backup Switch (VTABS) in the En Route environment.
This single source contract extension shall include:
	Maintenance of VSCS/VTABS Lab Systems supporting various aspects of the training, engineering support and depot maintenance support 	Supply/Support and repair of all Depot items for fielded and lab systems 	Technical refresh to Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and sub-systems as required 	Technical and project support for Second Level Engineering 	Installation of technical refresh items to the systems located at the 21 FAA ARTCCs, the FAA Training Academy, the William J. Hughes Technical Center, the Disaster Recovery lab and the Depot Support lab
The contractor is tasked to furnish engineering, maintenance, software updates, software engineering, testing, and supplemental support services for the VSCS Program, which is inclusive of all systems/subsystems as may be added and/or upgraded by a Service Life Extension and/or Technical Refresh.
The incumbent contractor currently has the trained and experienced personnel in-house, who, through prior VSCS/VTABS Field Deployments of upgrades, have gained the knowledge and working relationship with the FAA Site Operations and Personnel.  This knowledge is demonstrated daily when assisting the Second Level Engineering organization (located at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) in Atlantic City, New Jersey) on understanding complex problems being experienced by the field sites and planned maintenance upgrades to equipment.
The VSCS/VTABS Depot maintenance support, proposed in the single-source action, will include the inspection, test, repair and verification of failed items returned to the Depot.  There is substantial in-house repair capability required, using a variety of test sets in order to test components used in the switch, controller working position, control subsystem and other VSCS/VTABS subsystems.  It includes an understanding of VSCS/VTABS LRU schematics and repair methodologies in order to efficiently repair failed LRUs without performing unnecessary repairs.  It includes maintenance of the depot test sets, including the Maintenance Test Set Replacement - Functional At Speed Tester (MTSR-F), VSCS Electronics Module (VEM)/Position Electronics Module (PEM) test set, VSCS Display Module Replacement (VDM-R) test set, and other test tools.  It will also include continuation of a close liaison with the VSCS/VTABS Depot support contractors, currently in excess of twenty five (25), who are performing repair services on select repairable items returned from the VSCS and VTABS sites.  This effort as the Prime will include procuring the necessary bit and piece part support for the VSCS/VTABS Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and providing this support to repair service contractors as necessary.  This action is to be taken to prevent/stop counterfeit parts from being introduced into the repair process.  In addition, the cost of maintaining a viable contractor base with a proven deliverable end product will be assured.
The current contractor has a dedicated manufacturing facility that has the capability to manufacture the field site cable requirements which in turn has generated a cable catalog for ease of use in determining/supporting the requirement.  The contractor is also charged with the responsibility of being the second source of supply if one of the subcontractors supplying parts for the VSCS/VTABS program goes out of business and no other vendor is available to provide this service/material/component.
The current Contractor has Proprietary Data for the VSCS System 20/20 Switch (from the old Harris Digital Telephone Systems Division - HDTS) that is not available to the FAA for use in competing certain functions for manufacturing of required material items, Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), bit and piece material items used in the LRU repair process for the VSCS/VTABS Depot.  This data consists of over 600 individual specifications, drawings, manuals and instruction sheets with associated Software Files.
In addition to the Proprietary Data, the Harris Corporation maintains a warehouse with many obsolete (no longer available on the open market) VSCS/VTABS Residual Materials (Harris Ownership) that is being maintained as a supply source of bit and piece support items for the repair of LRUs in the VSCS Depot when no other source is available.
Pursuant to the current Contract Voice Switching and Control System (VSCS) Basic Contract, the Prime Contractor has in place the Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) Program to support the "Lifetime" of VSCS/VTABS.  The Program was implemented by a skilled team of diverse Contractor personnel representing a cross section of 14 disciplines.  This team, which includes FAA representatives from the Acquisition and Engineering disciplines, is structured to mitigate or prevent VSCS/VTABS obsolescence issues through proactive and reactive elements, using ISO 9001:2008 compliant Contractor (Harris) Command Media as its guide.
The DMSMS Proactive Step is achieved through Technical Refresh and Technical Insertion based upon: 
	Keeping VSCS/VTABS maintainable until the end of the contract period, 	Continuous application of technology to reduce Maintenance costs, and 	Application of state of the art technology as required to increase supportability and reliability at each of the FAA 21 ARTCCs, the WJHTC and the MMAC (Academy).
The DMSMS team is chartered to protect the Contractor Depot Logistics Support (CDLS) VSCS/VTABS Depot function against inability to maintain the VSCS in a state of readiness to support the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), integral to the FAA Air Traffic mission through the life of the system.  As a result of continued FAA requirements, the FAA sanctioned the Contractor to use the End-of-Life (EOL) dates provided therein for future Life-of-Type-Buy (LOTB) calculations.  The DMSMS team must analyze component use, failure trends and part availability to ensure sufficient supply of spare parts needed to repair VSCS/VTABS equipment until the EOL for VSCS/VTABS.
 Any firm that believes they can provide the scheduled Technical Refresh efforts and range of above services (the firm must demonstrate that the appropriate qualified personnel are currently in place with the contractor or the personnel are available in the timeframes to fulfill all of the engineering and support requirements and has submitted a letter of commitment to the Prime Contractor interested in the Program) is invited to submit their qualifications and experience for the VSCS project in writing by December 14, 2012.  Based upon the original investment in the FAA VSCS Program and reviewing the requirements in the current environment any potential contractor is advised that there is a large investment/start-up cost associated with this undertaking.  In addition to entering into negotiations with the FAA any potential contractor would have to enter into negotiations with the current contractor for the purpose of acquiring that portion of the VSCS/VTABS Laboratory that is owned by the incumbent.  To clarify, the FAA owns part of the equipment acquired with government funds and the contractor owns laboratory acquired items of equipment with private funds.  All of the equipment, both government owned and contractor owned, is required to have a fully functional VSCS/VTABS Laboratory used in the 24 hour day to day operational support of  FAA ARTCCs, the FAA Academy, the WJHTC in New Jersey and the VSCS/VTABS Depot Operations.  The FAA does not have ownership now nor have they ever had total ownership of all the equipment that comprises the VSCS/VTABS laboratory operating system located on-site at the current contractor's facility.  This laboratory equipment is critical to Depot operations in order to burn-in repaired LRUs or LRUs whose failures could not be verified before returning those assets to stock that is Ready For Issue (RFI) to the field.
The proposed contract extension will be for a four year period.  The single-source extension (base period) of performance will be January 01, 2015 through December 31, 2018.  This single-source extension (base period) is estimated to have a value of $78,330,793 which will include Critical Technical Refresh Services with associated hardware and the corresponding administrative support costs (e.g., program management and documentation updates, training conduct and engineering support).  One of the most significant and challenging items included is the total Contractor VSCS/VTABS Depot Logistics Support to maintain the FAA sites described in the above paragraph in a 24/7 continuous state of readiness.
Pursuant to the FAA's AMS Policy Guide, Section 3.2.2.4, Single-Source Selection is permitted when "such action is determined to be in the best interest of the FAA and the Rational Basis is documented".  Based upon the rationale within this document, procurement through a single source solicitation fulfills the requirement for a rational basis action.  This rationale is based upon coordination urgency, the need for standardization, and the Harris Corporation USA being the only source available to satisfy the interim requirements in the required time frame for continued, non-interrupted 24 hour service to US commercial flight operations and select oceanic operations.  The FAA has determined that a single source extension to the existing VSCS Contract (which was originally awarded through a competitive four year development contract that required the delivery of an operational system to the FAA prior to award of the production contract) provides the best value and most timely response to the FAA's existing/fielded Voice Switching and Control System (VSCS) requirements based on the following rationale.
A competitive bid approach is estimated to be a 48 month solicitation to contract award process (based on the original program) before a new qualified contractor could provide a System Specification and a compliant FAA-tested, approved system for support purposes.  This means that after the expiration of the current VSCS Contract (December 31, 2014), no switch upgrades will be available to meet FAA new facility and legacy switch replacement upgrade/repair/extension requirements until March 2019 without the current contract being extended.  In addition, the current 24 hour/day, 7 days/week VSCS Depot support would have to be renegotiated into a separate contract operation (estimated to be a 36 month process) and be ready to commence operational support on 01 January 2015.  The current VSCS/VTABS Depot support efforts are included in the VSCS Contract for simplicity of operations, ease of management, coordination of day-to-day system requirements, utilization of one Team of Professionals for all aspects of VSCS support to the field sites and upgrades to the multiple packages of Training Syllabus as a result of ongoing and planned complex Technical Refresh efforts for the Program.
Any vendor who believes that they can provide the services described in this announcement is requested to provide the government with their plan on how they would perform each of the following activities for VSCS/VTABS:
1)	Provide all depot maintenance and supply support for the hundreds of VSCS/VTABS LRUs and thousands of component bit and piece parts required for its upkeep.  This includes running a DMSMS program with experienced VSCS/VTABS logistics personnel, and consistent with this notice for VSCS/VTABS. 2)	Acquire trained and experienced VSCS personnel with the skill sets and knowledge of VSCS, VTABS and FAA site operations gained through years of VSCS/VTABS Field Deployments, VSCS Depot Operations and VSCS Technical Refresh efforts. 3)	Furnish systems engineering, software engineering, software updates and test engineering for the VSCS/VTABS program, including any required technical refresh during the service life of the VSCS/VTABS. 4)	Acquire the laboratory resources owned by Harris Corporation necessary to set up a lab in which to test both VSCS/VTABS spares, technical refresh projects and technical issues seen at field sites. 5)	Obtain the Proprietary Data for the VSCS System 20/20 Switch that will enable the vendor to manufacture, analyze, troubleshoot and provide DMSMS support for LRUs in the VSCS and VTABS switches as the system ages. 6)	Obtain the ability to perform in-house repair of VSCS/VTABS LRUs. This description must include how the vendor will obtain the understanding of VSCS/VTABS LRU schematics and repair methodologies in order to efficiently repair failed LRUs without performing unnecessary repairs (i.e., as part of a learning curve for technicians without adequate VSCS experience). 7)	Acquire the proprietary test set algorithms needed to update the software on the MTSR-F and VEM/PEM Test Set as needed to test for new failure modes as the system ages or provide technical refresh on the software. 8)	Prevent counterfeit parts from being acquired or used in any VSCS/VTABS repair activity, whether it is performed in-house or at a 3rd party vendor. 9)	Detail the dedicated manufacturing capability it has to quickly and efficiently manufacture VSCS/VTABS cables as well as provide a second source of supply for VSCS/VTABS components if the subcontractor responsible for that component goes out of business.
Each response received to this announcement will be evaluated using the following criteria:
1)	Vendor's plan will be evaluated to determine their ability to provide all depot maintenance and supply support for the hundreds of VSCS/VTABS LRUs and thousands of component bit and piece parts required for its upkeep.  The capability of the vendor DMSMS capability will be evaluated both in terms of VSCS/VTABS experience, logistics experience and adherence to the description in this notice. 2)	Vendor's capability to acquire trained and experienced VSCS personnel with the skill sets and knowledge of VSCS, VTABS and FAA site operations gained through years of VSCS/VTABS Field Deployments, VSCS Depot Operations and VSCS Technical Refresh efforts. 3)	Vendor's capability to furnish systems engineering, software engineering, software updates and test engineering for the VSCS/VTABS program, including any required technical refresh during the service life of the VSCS/VTABS. 4)	Vendor's capability to acquire the laboratory resources owned by Harris Corporation necessary to set up a lab in which to test both VSCS/VTABS spares, technical refresh projects and technical issues seen at field sites. 5)	Vendor's capability to obtain the Proprietary Data for the VSCS System 20/20 Switch that will enable the vendor to manufacture, analyze, troubleshoot and provide DMSMS support for LRUs in the VSCS and VTABS switches as the system ages. 6)	Vendor's capability to obtain the ability to perform in-house repair of VSCS/VTABS LRUs.  This description must include how the vendor will obtain the understanding of VSCS/VTABS LRU schematics and repair methodologies in order to efficiently repair failed LRUs without performing unnecessary repairs (i.e.,  as part of a learning curve for technicians without adequate VSCS experience). 7)	Vendor's capability to acquire the proprietary test set algorithms needed to update the software on the MTSR-F and VEM/PEM Test Set as needed to test for new failure modes as the system ages or provide technical refresh on the software. 8)	Vendor's capability to prevent counterfeit parts from being acquired or used in any VSCS/VTABS repair activity, whether it is performed in-house or at a 3rd party vendor. 9)	Vendor's dedicated manufacturing capability which would allow it to quickly and efficiently manufacture VSCS/VTABS cables as well as provide a second source of supply for VSCS/VTABS components if the subcontractor responsible for that component goes out of business.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics plans to procure on a sole source basis MEGA MUGA 80K assay kits from GeneSeek, Inc., 4665 Innovation Drive, Suite 120, Lincoln, NE 68521.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The delivery date shall be 14 days from receipt of samples.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.<br /><br />The Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics (LCBG) investigates the impact of constitutional genetic polymorphism on metastatic progression. The LCBG's current experiments are conducted in the Diversity Outcross (DO) mice, an outbred population of mice generated from 8 independent inbred strains. The random mating strategy used to generate the Diversity Outcross mice enables high resolution mapping of complex traits. However, high density genotyping is necessary for genetic mapping.</p>
<p>At present the only platform available for the level of resolution necessary for this purpose is the MEGA MUGA 80K BeadChip. The newly developed MEGA MUGA 80K BeadChip is an improved version of the MUGA 9K BeadChip, which the LCBG used in a previous study. Because both platforms are based on the same technology it will facilitate integrating the data from both studies.</p>
<p>The MEGA MUGA 80K BeadChip possess the following salient characteristics: <br />&bull; Total number of SNPs assayed : 77,800<br />&bull; Average SNP spacing on the mouse genome: 33 Kb<br />&bull; SNPs selected to be informative in most mouse populations including wild mice and multiple Mus species.<br />&bull; SNP selection optimal for markers in the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred populations.</p>
<p>Geneseek is the only known contractor that can provide the required MEGA MUGA 80K BeadChip. There is no other chip with a comparable SNP density, and no other known manufacturer of this product.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions on behalf of the NIDA Intramural Research Program intends to negotiate a Purchase Order on a sole source basis with the University of Maryland, located in College Park, MD. The Purchase Order will involve accessing data collected previously on a sample of children with extreme temperamental behavior (NIMH-IRP Protocol 03-M-0186: The Psychobiology of Temperament: An fMRI Study). <br /><br />The Section on Developmental and Affective Neuroscience (SDAN) at NIDA seeks to collect repeated data on a sample of subjects with the Child Development Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The Child Development Laboratory has characterized a sample of children in the first five years of their lives through repeated assessments of behavior and psychopathology.<br /><br />Data will be collected using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) techniques, and will be compared to data previously collected in the study by SDAN and the Child Development Laboratory. Neuroimaging techniques will be used to examine aspects of brain structure and function in the subjects by applying emotional stimuli. The degree to which the subjects' response to the emotional stimuli is affected by their network of friends, exposure to different types of social experiences, and their personalities will be studied.<br /><br />Characterization of this sample would largely be lost through selection and development of another sample. The University of Maryland is the only known source with the expertise of neuroimaging and assessing the psychopathology of this study sample.<br /><br />The period of performance is 12 months. <br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br />Comments to this announcement, referencing this synopsis number, may be submitted to the NIDA SS/SA Branch, prior to the closing date specified in this announcement, electronically to the attention of Hunter A. Tjugum, at tjugumha@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions on behalf of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate a Purchase Order on a sole source basis with the Johns Hopkins University located at 600 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21205. Purchase Order will include identifying structural and functional brain changes as early indicators of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease in participants involved in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). <br /><br />The Laboratory of Genetics at the NIA has a need to perform and quantify in vivo brain scans of amyloid neuropathology and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Changes in amyloid deposition will be measured using PET and C-Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB). PET scans will also be used to measure rCBF with O-water to allow comparison with previously measured levels of rCBF in BLSA participants. Measurement of rCBF uses 15-water, which has a 2-minute half-life, and C-PiB that has a 20-minute half-life. These measurements include radioisotopes that require an on-site cyclotron for radiopharmaceutical production. Contractor shall acquire the PET O-water and C-PiB neuroimaging scans and provide quantitative analysis of imaging data using kinetic modeling techniques. <br /><br />Information on changes in rCBF and amyloid deposition in vivo will be combined with the existing physical and psychological data for BLSA participants and provide insight on preclinical biomarkers of cognitive impairment including Alzheimer's disease. Scientific aims include investigating changes in brain function and amyloid burden as early biomarkers of cognitive decline and impairment including Alzheimer's disease; and to identify protective factors that may prevent or delay the onset of cognitive impairment in normal individuals that have substantial amyloid burden.<br /><br />In order to identify structural and functional brain changes of cerebral blood flow and amyloid deposition in BLSA participants, evaluations need to be performed using cyclotron produced short-lived radioactive isotopes. This neuroimaging requires an on-site cyclotron given the time constraints of the radioactive material for radiopharmaceutical production. Johns Hopkins Medical Institution is the only facility in the Baltimore region that possesses the necessary PET equipment and is capable of producing the radiopharmaceuticals within the time limits of this study. <br /><br />The period of performance is 12 months, with the option to add four (4) additional one-year optional periods of performance. <br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SWRMC) intends to solicit and negotiate a contract to accomplish repairs to the Emergency Diesel Generator Fuel Control Linkage onboard the USS HAMPTON (SSN-767).  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Fairbanks-Morse Engines, address:  1545 Tidelands Ave, National City, CA 91950.

The basis for restricting competition is that as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Fairbanks-Morse Engines is the only source with the available parts and capability of performing the repairs.

Since this is a Sole Source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE).
 

DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) order; Contract Line Item No.(CLIN) 0001 is to prepare for and accomplish repairs to the Emergency Diesel Generator Fuel Control Linkage onboard the USS HAMPTON (SSN-767). Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire Statement of Work.

<BR> <BR>NASA SEWP IV Bids Only:  Sellers bidding on this opportunity MUST have the items requested on an existing NASA SEWP IV contract. The contract must either be in the Seller's name or the Seller must be able to document its ability to act as an agent of a partner's contract. Sellers must not bid more than their applicable contract ceiling price, excluding the FedBid Fee, for contract-specific items. If FedBid receives notice that, due to inclusion of the FedBid Fee, the Selected Bid's line item pricing is higher than the Selected Seller's applicable published government contract pricing, the FedBid Fee will be reduced to ensure the Selected Bid's line item pricing does not exceed the Selected Seller's applicable contract pricing.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is posted to publicize the Government's intent to issue Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to all qualified  vendors who exhibit the required technical capabilities, specialized experience, and past performance in providing facility repairs, improvements, construction, and equipment procurement/installation to improve and assure mission reliability of electric power and mechanical utilities, and infrastructure.  <br>  <br> Requirement: <br>  <br> Under this BOA, potential contractors will be responsible for facility repairs, improvements, construction, and equipment procurement/installation to improve and assure mission reliability of electric power and mechanical utilities, and infrastructure and other facilities located at the Garrisons and military installations in order to provide compliance with code, criteria, and regulations. Work includes, but is not limited to, electrical power distribution systems, grounding systems, standby and emergency power, lightning and surge protection, short-circuit coordination studies, reliability/availability studies, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, computational fluid dynamics studies, fire protection systems, high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) protection, TEMPEST, electromagnetic interference protection, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) protections, and facility commissioning. At times, the Contractor may be required to provide stand alone construction efforts without the provision of the associated services (i.e. site investigation, work plan, etc.)  The intent of this BOA is to capture the services of the Resilient Power and Mechanical Systems (RPMS) Program to provide facility repairs, improvements, construction, and equipment procurement/installation to improve and assure mission reliability of electric power and mechanical utilities, and infrastructure at the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC).  <br>  <br> Evaluation Criteria Overview: <br>  <br> Each vendor will be evaluated for technical capability and will be rated as  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  or  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark . To receive a BOA, a vendor must receive an  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  rating for technical capability. BOAs will be established with companies under the following considerations:  <br>  <br> 1) Technical Capability  <br> Technical Approach  <br> Specialized Experience  <br>  <br> 2) Past performance will be assessed by the Government for demonstrated RPMS relevant maintenance and repair services. The vendors will be required to submit relevant and recent examples. Potential BOA holders must also be determined Responsible as prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.1. <br>  <br> Specific locations will be determined at the task order level.  <br>  <br> It is estimated the program requirements for this action will total $240M over a five (5) year period. It is anticipated that no more than 10% of the program value will be Time and Materials (T&M). The BOAs will be reviewed annually. In addition, an annual pre-solicitation notice will be issued to provide the projected requirements for the upcoming year. At that time, new firms may submit the required documentation to join the BOA pool. Also, at this time, any firms who are rarely or never used will be transferred to an off-ramp.  Once BOAs are established, it is the Government's intent to solicit only those firms holding a BOA for this requirement; however, this does not preclude other firms from submitting proposals. Each Order RFP will be posted on the FedBizOpps through the Army's Single Face to Industry (AFSI) portal for public awareness. Orders may be solicited on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or Time-and-Materials (T&M) basis. All proposals received will be evaluated in accordance with established criteria unique to each Order requirement. The BOA itself is not a contract. The orders against the BOA will become binding contracts upon award. <br>  <br> Offeror's are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the vendor . This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only and will be available on or about 18 Dec 2012.  <br>  <br> Note: Response Date referenced under General Information does not refer to the submission l due date.

The TAC intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Priced (FFP) contract for a twelve (12) month Base Period and two (2) 12-month Option Periods to Cerner Corporation (Cerner), 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, Kansas City, MO.
The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire continued support for the LSRP with Cerner Corporation's  Millennium PathNet Remote Hosting (RHO) capabilities which includes disaster recovery infrastructure, personnel, and training for the system technical staff and application support staff required to sustain and maintain the current LSRP Alpha site at Huntington, West Virginia VA Medical Center (VAMC).  The Government does not possess technical data that completely defines the required functionality included in the Millennium PathNet Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) software to allow for a competitive acquisition with other vendors or allow VA to use internal resources to provide the required end user training of the software application at the Alpha site.  Accordingly, Cerner Corporation is considered the only source capable of satisfying the Government's requirements.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 518210. The estimated date of award for this action is December 31, 2012.
This is a notice of intent, not a request for proposals.  The proposed solicitation number is VA118-13-R-0050 which is anticipated for release on or about December 14, 2012.  Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Eleanor Slocum, e-mail:  Eleanor.Slocum@va.gov, with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-13-R-0050.

<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for a Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART NAS). A Draft Statement of Work describing the SMART NAS requirement is attached. NASA has a need to develop SMART-NAS capability to accelerate transformation of the NAS. SMART-NAS will allow integrated, real-time and/or fast-time assessment of gate-to-gate operations and their performance using real-world NAS inputs.  SMART-NAS would allow for plug-and-play of different technologies to operate in combined real, virtual, and constructive manners as dictated by the study goals. The goal of the SMART-NAS initiative is to develop a capability to explore alternative concepts, technologies, and architectures at the NAS level in an integrated manner.  SMART-NAS will enable assessments to demonstrate feasibility and benefits for modernization-related decision-making. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for SMARTNAS. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. Capability Statements shall address the following:  Experience in developing functional and software system architectures related to large-scale simulation capability and/or enterprise level systems, preferably related to air traffic management operations.  Experience with open source architecture development.  Experience in developing cost estimation of large scale systems related to air traffic management and/or complex domains.  Experience in conducting benefits assessments related to air traffic management concepts and technologies.  Experience in developing advanced concepts and technologies related to air traffic management.  Past Performance related to Air Traffic Management Research and Development. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, or any category of small business*, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number). Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. All responses shall be submitted to Christine Martinez no later than 4:00pm PST on Wednesday, December 12, 2012. Please send all responses to Christine.Martinez@nasa.gov.

<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible businesses, under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 621111, Office of Physicians (except Mental Health Specialists), with size standard of $10.0M Per Annum.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge.</p>
<p>The DIR-NHGRI- Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP) protocol 76-HG-0238, Clinical Trial Number: NCT00369421 are connected to this clinical testing, which began in 2008 as a vehicle for admitting patients with broader range of inborn errors of metabolism. Under this observational protocol study, patients with long-standing, complex undiagnosed diseases are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for comprehensive evaluation to discover new genetic disorders and/or potential treatments. The UDP program has made 47 diagnoses, which is about 20% of the total number of patients seen in this protocol to date. Ongoing research continues<br />to find diagnosis on the other patients who have been seen in the UDP to date. <br /><br />The Researchers in the Protocol study intend on diagnosing and treating certain inborn errors of metabolism. By doing this, researchers hope to expand their knowledge about these disorders and provide access to patients of interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Patients enrolled in this protocol have been referred with a known or suspected inborn error of metabolism, heritable disorder, or genetic predisposition. Patients participating in this study will be examined and treated on an outpatient basis, if practical. However, patients requiring specialized tests or treatments will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center as necessary. Researchers will use only accepted medical procedures in diagnosing (medical history, physical examinations, X-ray studies, eye examinations, blood tests, and urine tests) and treating the patients involved in this study. Additional tests may be required on a case by case basis. UDP has a critical need for expertise in clinical and laboratory genetic services, a key component in current and future clinical study results.</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia, PA office is seeking information for potential sources of expertise in the logistics support services necessary to assist Naval Weapons System Support (NAVWSS) in ensuring that the new ERP systems are effectively implemented, corrected defects are validated, and failed IDOCS (intermediate documents) are maintained at an acceptable level. 

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses to provide the required products and/or services and plan to hire and maintain sufficient qualified staff. Additionally, this Sources Sought notice is being published with the intent to promote competition.
 Suggestions from industry regarding how competition may best be achieved are requested. All such suggestions will be considered; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit for the required services in a manner of its own choosing in accordance with the applicable procurement regulations. The anticipated place of performance is as follows:

Place of Performance:
Naval Supply Systems Command  Weapons Systems Support
700 Robbins Avenue  Building 1
Philadelphia, PA 19111

5450 Carlisle Pike  Building 311
Mechanicsburg, PA 17055

Anticipated Period of Performance:  28 March 2013  27 September 2013 and two 6-month options.

DISCLAIMER
THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.
 THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL
DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND
The NAVSUP WSS has recently implemented a new and complex Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) throughout its organization. This new system has completely changed the framework of the Navys information technology system. The system is designed to incorporate the latest commercial technology into the way the Navy conducts its supply and financial operations.
 The end result will be a streamlined system that is less costly to run and more efficient in the management of the NAVYs inventory assets. Due to the complexity of the Navy logistics operations, the Navy ERP Program has evolved into a very unique system with little or no comparison to the private sector.

As with any new system of this magnitude there are several problems that need to be addressed. Principal among these problems are the many documents that fail to successfully process through the new system. These documents fail for a variety of reasons and must be corrected and successfully processed back into the system. This is a critical step in the process and if not properly completed the entire system will be rendered ineffective.
 The failed documents were an expected outcome of the introduction of this new system and a process to analyze causes of these failures and to identify solutions was implemented. In the interim, the failed documents needed correction.

Services associated with this requirement are currently being procured via task order N00189-12-F-Z439 under contract GS-23F-0076K with GENERAL DYNAMICS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY and previously through task order(s) under contract N00421-08-D-0013 with the same. The current contract type is Firm Fixed Price.

The attached draft statement of work provides additional information about the required tasking. It is requested that, in its response to the Sources Sought, a vendor identify whether it has the capability to perform under all of the tasking or only specific portions of it.
 Also, if the vendor has any questions about the structure of the statement of work, please also identify those in the response.

ELIGIBILITY
The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541330 and the size standard is $14M. The Product Service Code (PSC) is R706.

SUBMISSION DETAILS
Interested businesses should submit a brief capabilities statement package of no more than ten 8.5" x 11" pages (font no smaller than 10 point) demonstrating ability to perform the services listed in this Technical Description. All responses shall include Company Name, Company Address, Company Business Size and Points-of-Contact information including name, phone number, fax number and e-mail address.

Responses to this Sources Sought shall be submitted electronically by email to Charles Hoyes, Contract Specialist, at charles.hoyes@navy.mil.
 Responses shall be received no later than 1600 Eastern Time on 26 Oct 2012.
Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Please submit all questions to the Contract Specialist via email or alternatively at 717-605-2024. No phone or email solicitations regarding the status of the request for proposal will be accepted prior to its release.

Some new controls components shall be added / installed in different areas of Building 500 to improve control / monitoring capabilities of selected equipment and operational variables at the Engineering Control Center (ECC).

2.	Replace selected VAV boxes with units meeting current cooling and heating load airflow requirements for these areas. Benchmark on existing VAV boxes if found, by engineering analysis, to be appropriately sized and operating efficiently.
Also, evaluate need of VAVs with Hot Water Re-heat at these areas. Select boxes for maximum modulation and ensure a minimum of 2.5 duct diameters of straight duct at the inlet of the box is installed.   

3.	New controls shall permit remote operation (i.e., on/off) of controlled equipment / devices, where applicable, as well as monitoring status / value of measured parameters at the ECC. New control / monitoring devices shall consist of, but not limited to, those intended for monitoring space temperature, humidity, duct static pressure, duct air temperature, air volume, status alarms, smoke alarms, differential pressure, start/stop, freeze protection, variable frequency drives (VFDs) status indicators / remote operation, open/close, etc.

4.	Provide a control diagram showing all controlled devices with unique designation numbers. Describe the role of each controlled device in the sequence of operation. Describe the sequence of operation in all modes.

5.	Perform commissioning services to ensure that systems are designed, installed, functionally tested, and capable of being operated and maintain to perform in conformity with the design intent. Such services shall be applicable to the operation of fan systems; direct digital controls (DDC), VFDs and Variable Air Volume (VAV) boxes, with or without re-heat. Commissioning process / plan shall provide for off-season testing to allow testing, balancing and optimization of integrated systems under the best conditions.

6.	Architectural Issues: The design guidelines as listed below are to be followed.

<DESC>EMSL's 2013 Call for Proposals will be open December 21, 2012 - March 1, 2013 for high-impact user research proposals focused on selected topics in environmental molecular science. Approved proposals will be granted access to EMSL resources beginning October 1, 2013. Proposals submitted under this Call are valid for two years provided the annual summary and extension request demonstrate sufficient progress toward the stated goals. A select number of proposal authors may be invited to submit project plans to extend the work for a third year. Through the proposal and review process, EMSL allocates access to research instruments, staff, and facility services. Access to instruments is provided at no cost to users for research that is in the public domain and intended for publication in the open literature, but users are responsible for funding their own team's labor and travel expenses. Details related to focused topics under the Call will be available on EMSL's website on December 21 (http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/access/calls/).

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is 611430: Professional and Management Development Training. The small business size is $7.0 million.

Include whether or not you are a small business; HUB-Zone small business; service-disabled veteran owned, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business in order to assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on behalf of the Department of the Treasury intends to issue a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order, on the basis of only one responsible source, for the purchase of software maintenance for its current OPNET software licenses.
<p>The period of performance will be December 15, 2012 - December 14, 2013.</p>
<p>This purchase order will be made on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 (a) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government anticipates the value of the award to be $42,288.96.</p>
<p>Justification for other than full and open competition - Only One Source Rationale:<br />"The Department of the Treasury's Departmental Offices (DO) is seeking to renew its hardware &amp; software maintenance and support of its current OPNET licenses. This maintenance and support offers solutions for application and network performance management. OPNET Maintenance will address hardware &amp; software defects, failures, replacements and technical support hours 24x7x365. OPNET Software will address: application performance management, network performance management, and network R&amp;D. OPNET Solutions will deliver broad visibility, monitoring across infrastructure domains, deep data collection and analytics to enable powerful root cause diagnosis. This procurement will continue the current maintenance support and software license agreements currently owned by the Treasury/DO/OCIO.</p>
<p>OPNET is the only available source for the software maintenance and support of OPNET software licenses. This is because OPNET does not have any authorized resellers for software maintenance and support. OPNET only allows resellers to sell the initial licenses to the Government. It does not allow resellers to sell/provide the software &amp; hardware maintenance and support. OPNET sent a letter to the CO via email on 10/09/2012 stating that it does not have any authorized resellers for software &amp; hardware maintenance and support."</p>
<p>The Department of the Treasury has identified OPNET Technologies, Inc as the sole source for software maintenance on OPNET software licenses.</p>
<p>The notice will of intent to award to OPNET Technologies, Inc will be posted on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.2.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted and it was determined that only OPNET can perform the required work as it is the only source for the hardware and software maintenance and support. GSAAdvantage! and DOD's Software Application Systems were searched and no other resellers were found. OPNET sent a letter to the CO via email on 10/09/2012 stating that it does not have any authorized resellers for software maintenance.</p>
<p>No sources expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to search the market place for solutions that will meet the Government's needs. However, the Government will continue to search for other authorized resellers of OPNET's software maintenance for future procurements.</p>
<p>The Contracting officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Any other responsible sources who believe they can provide the required products and service may submit a written capability statement, via email, by 10 am ET on December 10, 2012. Telephone inquiries will be considered non-responsive. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, requests for solicitations will be considered non-responsive. If no responses are received the award will be made to OPNET Technologies, Inc.</p>

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for GfK Kenetec Inc.s AgroTrak pesticide usage data. The U.S. Geological Survey requires data on agricultural pesticide use in the United States.  GfK Kenetec Inc. provides information on the amount and distribution of pesticide usage in the U.S., as well as seed trait information indicating the use of genetically modified crops.  This data is needed in order for the U.S. Geological Surveys National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program to study the effects of pesticides on water quality. Annual use estimates are required for major crops and all significant active pesticide ingredients at the geographic level of Crop Reporting Districts (CRDs), including all CRDs in the United States. Annual use statistics are required for 2012 and 2013, including reliability estimates for each year, and annual seed trait data for cotton, corn, and soybeans for 2012-2013 (also reported at the CRD level).
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to GfK Kenetec Inc., unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contracting Specialist, kmoris@usgs.gov no later than 12:00 PM EST, Wednesday, December 19, 2012 with an affirmative answer.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (insert current date) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />NWWT9386-13-00571 FOR HELIUM</p>
<p><br />1. Background</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Las Vegas, Nevada launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 3am and 3pm PST (4am and 4pm PDT). Each balloon requires approximately 82 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. Objective</p>
<p>The objective of the National Weather Service is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of helium (between 1,148 and 1,190 cubic feet per week) to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. Scope</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the National Weather Service office located at 7851 Dean Martin Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89139. The total amount of helium needed for this requirement is between 1,148 and 1,190 cubic feet per week, which extends to between 5,084 and 5,270 cubic feet per month (between 59,860 and 62,050 cubic feet per year).</p>
<p>4. Requirements</p>
<p>The Contractor shall supply 2,380 CF of helium on January 1, 2013 to the NWS office in Las Vegas, Nevada. The helium cylinders must be provided in two 6-packs. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive two 6-packs and store two individual cylinders of helium at a time.</p>
<p>After the initial supply, the National Weather Service will contact the Contractor to set up automatic delivery of two 6-packs and pick up the empty 6-packs within the same trip. Delivery will be set up as every other Tuesday between the hours of 7:00 am and 12:00 pm local time.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. A loading and unloading area is available at this location such that a 6-pack can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. The Contractor shall contact National Weather Service personnel at this location when a delivery is occurring to gain access to the loading area.</p>
<p>If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount, or the price of the contract may be reduced to reflect the reduced value received.</p>
<p>5. Safety and Security</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the (MIC) or (ASA) at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>Driver needs to come into the office; front entrance of the office building and an NWS employee will unlock the gate.</p>
<p>6. Place of Performance</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made at the National Weather Service office at 7851 Dean Martin Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89139. Point of delivery is behind our locked gated fence; just north of our office building.</p>
<p>7. Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013.</p>
<p>8. Points of Contact</p>
<p>The Government contacts at the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas, Nevada are:</p>
<p>Observation Program Leader - Donald Maker, 702-263-9744 x 268, Donald.maker@noaa.gov <br />Administrative Support Assistant - Rosalin Cianflocco, 702-263-9744 x 221, rosalin.cianflocco@noaa.gov<br />Meteorologist In Charge - Todd Lericos, 702-263-9744 x 222, todd.lericos@noaa.go</p>
<p>9. Invoicing</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's helium deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c.

Offered prices shall account for all CLINS and the resources necessary to meet the requirements outlined in the solicitation such as the cost of personnel, tools, materials, supplies, training, gear, supervision, reports and travel.    <br>  <br>  <br> ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 <br>  <br> The Government will award a Firm-Fixed-Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   <br>  <br> Proposals will be evaluated pursuant to FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price, Technically Accept able (LPTA) source selection process.  Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the evaluation criteria under the Technical factor and its sub-factors and Past Performance. The Government intends to evaluate three factors:  (1) Technical; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Price, in making a source selection decision in accordance with FAR 15.3.   <br>  <br> If any of the Technical factors and its subfactors below is rated  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  then the Government will no longer consider issuing an order to that offeror, thus the offeror will be ineligible for award. The following shall be used to evaluate all offers: <br>  <br> FACTOR 1:  TECHNICAL. Offerors shall submit written narratives that demonstrate their qualifications to perform the required services, as follows:  <br>  <br> SUBFACTOR 1: TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE. Offeror's technicians have been factory-trained and have a minimum of 2 years experience working on contracted equipment. <br>  <br> SUBFACTOR 2: TECHNICAL APPROACH. Offerors shall submit written narratives that clearly describe what resources - facilities, personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supplies, training and gear - will be dedicated to meeting the requirements outlined in the PWS. <br>  <br> SUBFACTOR 3: ENGLISH PROFICIENCY.  Offeror's technicians shall be able to read, write and speak English.  Technicians shall be able to compile required service and inspection reports; to compile and complete required forms.. <br>  <br> TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARDS.  The offeror's  technical offer will be evaluated using the following standards for a final rating: <br>  <br> ACCEPTABLE:  An offer which meets all the technical requirements identified in the solicitation.   <br>  <br> UNACCEPTABLE:  An offer which fails to meet one or more of the technical requirements identified in the solicitation. <br>  <br>  <br> II.  FACTOR 2:  PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR <br>  <br> The Government will evaluate each offeror's past performance information by evaluating the past performance questionnaires completed by offeror's customers. A neutral rating will be assigned to an offeror that has no previous past performance experience.   If the final rating is neutral, then past performance will not be given an acceptable or unacceptable rating and will not be counted in the final technical rating.  <br>  <br> The past performance evaluation will be based on the evaluation standards stated below in making a technical acceptability rating of each offeror's past performance questionnaire.  <br>  <br> PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION STANDARDS: <br>  <br> (1) ACCEPTABLE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performancerecord is unknown. (See note below.)		 <br>  <br> (2)  UNACCEPTABLE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.	  <br>  <br> (3) NEUTRAL - Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.   <br>  <br> NOTE: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,  quote mark unknown quote mark  shall be considered  quote mark acceptable. quote mark  <br>  <br>  <br> III. FACTOR 3:  PRICE <br>  <br> The Government will select the offer that is based upon the lowest evaluated price, technically acceptable offer. All CLINS will be priced by the offeror. If the offeror fails to price all CLINS, the offer will not be considered for award.  The extended amount for each contract line item will be added up for a grand total and will be used to calculate the offeror's total price for the Base Period and all Option Periods.   <br>  <br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of option prices shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options). <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of  the offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offeror's  specified expiration time, the Government may accept a offer,  (or part of the offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br>  <br> It is the responsibility of the Offeror to ensure the offer is received. Please note the offer must be received by European Regional Contracting Office before closing date and time for this solicitation, or the offer will not be considered.   <br>   <br>  <br> SPECIAL NOTE: All vendors must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, and lack of registration shall make an offer ineligible for award.

If incorporated by reference, see provision 52.252-1 herein for locations where full text can be found. <br>  <br> (End of Addendum to 52.212-1) <br>  <br> CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE <br>  <br> FAR 52.211-6   Brand Name or Equal  (AUG 1999)  <br> FAR 52.225-25 Prohibition on Engaging in Sanctioned Activities Relating to Iran-Certification  (NOV 2011) <br>  <br> CLAUSES INCORPORATED IN FULL TEXT <br>  <br>  <br> 52.252-1  Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998) <br> for all referenced clauses/provisions, see web site http://www.farite.hill.af.mil  or https://www.acquisition.gov <br>  <br> FAR 52.252-5     AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN PROVISIONS (APR 1984)  <br>  <br> (a) The use in this solicitation of any Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) provision with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of quote mark (DEVIATION) quote mark  after the date of the provision. <br> The use in this solicitation of any DOD FAR Supplement (48 CFR Chapter 2) provision with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of  quote mark (DEVIATION) quote mark  after the name of the regulation. <br> 	 <br> FAR 252.204-7011 Alternative Line-Item Structure (SEP 2011)    <br>  <br> 	(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal  <br> Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor. <br>      <br> (b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow. <br>  <br>        Solicitation: <br>  <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>             Item No.                  Supplies/Service        Quantity        Unit      Unit price      Amount <br> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> 0001............................

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: The award decision will be based on the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable offer.  Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. quote mark  <br>  <br>  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br>  <br> (End of provision) <br>  <br>  <br> ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 <br>  <br> Paragraph (a) is hereby supplemented with the following: <br>  <br>  (a).  The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any additional expense must be justified by a corresponding value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater quality of performance.   <br>  <br> (b).   Contractors may not qualify if any of the following are not met:  <br>  <br> 1.   	Proposal does not reasonably address the requirements in the request for proposal (RFP). <br> 2.	Proposal includes major deficiencies or omissions which discussions could not be expected to cure without a major revision or a new proposal. <br>  <br> 3.	Proposal is so technically inferior or so out of line in price as compared to other proposals as to preclude it from having a reasonable chance for award. <br>  <br> 4. 	An unrealistically low price, may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement for the geographic area of service, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an imprudent offer. <br> 5.   The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if necessary. <br>  <br>  <br> PART I    TECHINICAL: <br>  <br> Technical capability to include product literature, catalog price lists if available; warranty, guarantee, technical specs, and  delivery information. <br>  <br> Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. <br>  <br> Definitions are as follows:  <br>  <br> ACCEPTABLE: To be rated acceptable, the offeror's technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements.  <br>  <br> UNACCEPTABLE: A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements will be determined unacceptable.  <br>  <br>  <br> PART II   PAST PERFORMANCE <br>  <br> Offeror is required to submit information, on a single page, identifying federal, state and local Government and private contracts performed within the past three years, which are similar in  scope and complexity to the effort described in this solicitation.  If none, offeror should so state and provide information on references. <br>  <br> Information provided by the Contractor shall state:  The type of service provided with information to verify references:  Names; telephone numbers; Points of Contact; amount of contract; and email addresses. <br>  <br> Past performance shall be used as an evaluation factor within the LPTA process, unless waived by the PCO in accordance with FAR 15.101- 2(b). It shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305 and DFARS 215.305.  However, the comparative assessment in FAR 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply.  Therefore, past performance will be rated on an  quote mark acceptable quote mark  or  quote mark unacceptable quote mark  basis using the ratings below. <br>  <br> Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.) <br>  <br> Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br>  <br> Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, <br>  quote mark unknown quote mark  shall be considered  quote mark acceptable. quote mark   <br>  <br> PART III    PRICE: <br>  <br> Price will be evaluated separately from Technical and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability.  <br> Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> 52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEB 2012) ALTERNATE I (APR 2011) <br>  <br>  <br> Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications with their offer. Offerors shall include a confirmation of receipt of any amendments to this solicitation. Failure to submit a confirmation could result in the offer being determined non- responsive. <br>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>11. Reference Number: N/A</p>
<p>12. Description:</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200015 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-62. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:</p>
<p>SPACER<br />P/N: 360A32-1105-20<br />NSN: 5365-14-386-1327<br />QTY: 47 EA<br />MFGCC: F0210</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.<br />It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.</p>
<p>Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required.</p>
<p>The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:</p>
<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:</p>
<p>Cost or Pricing Data<br />It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition. However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.</p>
<p>Evaluation - Commercial Items <br />Quotes will be evaluated and purchase order issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable. <br />Technically Acceptable: Quotes must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>FAR 52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference Feb 1998</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

This information forms the foundation for the interpretation of adverse events, and it is constantly changing as the volume of published medical information increases exponentially.<br />The online subscription should provide capabilities that include the following:<br />1. Clinical knowledge resource with scientific studies published in high-quality peer reviewed journals demonstrating an impact on patient safety, reduced hospital complications, improved hospital efficiency, and improved medical knowledge acquisition.<br />2. Accessible from anywhere.<br />3. Shall be an evidence-based, regularly revised, state-of-the-art, and concordant with medical professional level material. Ability for patients and doctors to actively participate in shared decision making.<br />4. Present the clinician with synthesized content: one-stop shopping for a clear and concise answer. Should not offer aggregation of many information resources such as textbooks or journals articles, leaving the clinician to choose among them.<br />5. Maintains multiple layers of redundancy to assure consistent availability with web farms located in Tokyo, Frankfurt, New York, and California (worldwide redundant servers etc.)<br />6. A fully integrated drug database, a drug-drug, drug-herb, and herb-herb interaction module and medical calculators.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>**THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN UPDATED TO 21 DECEMBER 2012**</strong></p>
<p>No other changes have been made.<br /><br />This Request for Information is identical to N68335-13-RFI-7101 which has been simultaneously posted under PSC Code 62 (Lighting Fixtures and Lamps).</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst NJ (NAWCADLKE) is requesting comments from industry on the DRAFT Statement of Work and Specification currently being developed to successfully design, develop, integrate, test, qualify, and produce a Sustainment Lighting System (SLS) for the United States Marine Corps. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used by the government in the development of its acquisition strategy and refinement of the SLS system specification.</p>
<p>The mission of the NAVAIR EAF Program is to provide the Marine Corps with the equipment necessary to support the rapid deployment and establishment of self-sustaining airfields in austere, expeditionary operating environments with a minimum of infrastructure. This capability is achieved through the installation of one or more EAF subsystems, which include airfield surfacing systems, expeditionary arresting gear, terminal guidance systems and airfield lighting and marking systems. Headquarters Marine Corps has identified the need to replace legacy EAF airfield lighting systems in order to increase operational capability. Presently fielded EAF airfield lighting systems are not capable of supporting runway operations in Category I (CAT I) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) meteorological conditions, and a need exists to improve compatibility with Night Vision Devices (NVD) at both runways and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) sites.</p>
<p>The SLS shall be comprised of two individual, but interoperable, airfield lighting modules to appropriately scope the capability and optimize the equipment necessary to meet the diverse operating needs of Marine Aviation during deployments and at garrison training sites. These two modules and their contents are described as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; VTOL Module shall provide the components necessary to support nighttime vertical lift aircraft operating in Visual Flight Rules (VFR) meteorological conditions at remote sites and within an airfield complex without the need for an external power interface. The VTOL Module consists of edge lighting, wind indication and controllers (both portable and pilot-activated).</p>
<p>&bull; Runway Module shall provide the components necessary to define the operating surface of a 6,000 foot long bi-directional runway and its associated taxiways, in addition to providing visual approach aids, wind cones, informational lighting and signage, and controllers. The Runway Module shall provide additional runway edge lighting and associated cabling and hardware to expand the runway by up to 2000 feet in length as a separate package. The composition of components must allow for system installations to be scaled for different airfield dimensions and for the ability to continue aircraft launch and recovery operations as meteorological conditions degrade. The Runway Module shall include three approach light systems in order to support runway operations in VFR, Non-Precision IFR, and CAT I IFR meteorological conditions, as defined by the Marine Corps below:</p>
<p>VFR 1000 foot ceiling, 3 statute mile visibility<br />Non-Precision IFR 250 foot ceiling, &frac34; statute mile visibility<br />CAT I Precision IFR 200 foot ceiling, &frac12; statute mile visibility</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Detailed system performance parameters are provided in the supporting draft System Specification and draft Statement of Work. Comments and feedback related to these documents are welcomed and all questions will be responded to in an anonymous fashion through further postings against this synopsis.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should consider the suggested page limitations of 1 written page, 12 point font, per bulleted item below. Brochures, pamphlets and other marketing or sales media should not be provided in response to this RFI. Respondents to this RFI should ensure that the following areas are addressed:</p>
<p>&bull; Interoperability and control issues arising from the use of products from multiple sources.<br />&bull; Approach to obsolescence mitigation for critical technologies, e.g. LED, batteries.<br />&bull; Application of Open Architecture in order to minimize issues with redesign during the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Software approach to allow for Government support of system software over the system's life cycle.<br />&bull; Experience with software development and company CMMI certification<br />&bull; Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the solutions provided in response to this RFI.<br />&bull; Ease of upgrade/compatibility with third party hardware.<br />&bull; Maximum design flexibility directed at future competitive procurements.<br />&bull; Obstacles to meeting any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Level of development required to meet any area within the SOW or Specification.<br />&bull; Identify technical risk areas.<br />&bull; Provide a notional schedule to accomplish tasks outlined in SOW/Specification.</p>
<p>Material identified as Company Proprietary provided in response to this RFI will be treated as such by the government. Any interested parties must contact Michelle Prinston at michelle.prinston@navy.mil to request a copy of the Statement of Work and Specification.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the PMA-251 Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in the RFI. NAVAIR will not pay respondents for any information generated for or provided in response to this RFI. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia, PA office is seeking information for potential sources of expertise in the logistics support services necessary to assist Naval Weapons System Support (NAVWSS) in ensuring that the new ERP systems are effectively implemented, corrected defects are validated, and failed IDOCS (intermediate documents) are maintained at an acceptable level. 

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses to provide the required products and/or services and plan to hire and maintain sufficient qualified staff. Additionally, this Sources Sought notice is being published with the intent to promote competition.
 Suggestions from industry regarding how competition may best be achieved are requested. All such suggestions will be considered; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit for the required services in a manner of its own choosing in accordance with the applicable procurement regulations. The anticipated place of performance and on-site/off-site support requirements is as follows:

Place of Performance:
Naval Supply Systems Command  Weapons Systems Support
700 Robbins Avenue  Building 1
Philadelphia, PA 19111

5450 Carlisle Pike  Building 311
Mechanicsburg, PA 17055
Anticipated Period of Performance:  28 March 2013  27 September 2013 and two 6-month options.
DISCLAIMER
THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.
 THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL
DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND
The NAVSUP WSS has recently implemented a new and complex Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) throughout its organization. This new system has completely changed the framework of the Navys information technology system. The system is designed to incorporate the latest commercial technology into the way the Navy conducts its supply and financial operations.
 The end result will be a streamlined system that is less costly to run and more efficient in the management of the NAVYs inventory assets. Due to the complexity of the Navy logistics operations, the Navy ERP Program has evolved into a very unique system with little or no comparison to the private sector.

As with any new system of this magnitude there are several problems that need to be addressed. Principal among these problems are the many documents that fail to successfully process through the new system. These documents fail for a variety of reasons and must be corrected and successfully processed back into the system. This is a critical step in the process and if not properly completed the entire system will be rendered ineffective.
 The failed documents were an expected outcome of the introduction of this new system and a process to analyze causes of these failures and to identify solutions was implemented. In the interim, the failed documents needed correction.

Services associated with this requirement are currently being procured via task order N00189-12-F-Z439 under contract GS-23F-0076K with GENERAL DYNAMICS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY and previously through task order(s) under contract N00421-08-D-0013 with the same. The current contract type is Firm Fixed Price.

The attached draft statement of work provides additional information about the required tasking. It is requested that, in its response to the Sources Sought, a vendor identify whether it has the capability to perform under all of the tasking or only specific portions of it.
 Also, if the vendor has any questions about the structure of the statement of work, please also identify those in the response.

ELIGIBILITY
The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541330 and the size standard is $14M. The Product Service Code (PSC) is R706.
SUBMISSION DETAILS
Interested businesses should submit a brief capabilities statement package of no more than ten 8.5" x 11" pages (font no smaller than 10 point) demonstrating ability to perform the services listed in this Technical Description. All responses shall include Company Name, Company Address, Company Business Size and Points-of-Contact information including name, phone number, fax number and e-mail address.

Responses to this Sources Sought shall be submitted electronically by email to Charles Hoyes, Contract Specialist, at charles.hoyes@navy.mil .
 Responses shall be received no later than 1600 Eastern Time on 26 Oct 2012.
Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Please submit all questions to the Contract Specialist via email or alternatively at 717-605-2024. No phone or email solicitations regarding the status of the request for proposal will be accepted prior to its release.

Modification Information:
This is not a solicitation; the Government is not seeking offers at this time.  The Government is only examining the market place and the small business market in relation to this effort.  Services were performed via task order(s) under contract N00421-08-D-0013 task order 0265, this is not a re-compete of that entire contract.  There is no information as to the status of the entire contract N00421-08-D-0013 and is not part of this requirement.
  This potential requirement is just for the services outlined in the draft Statement of Work which was attached to the Source Sought notice.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be published before the end of this calendar year.  The attached Draft PWS includes all performance and deliverable requirements as currently performed.  There will be no conference calls or discussions at this time.  It has not been determined whether this requirement will be set aside for small business.

The workload estimates for the base period of this requirement (28 March 2013 through 27 September 2013) include the following labor categories.  This information is provided for whatever purpose the contractor may use it; however, the Government expressly disclaims responsibility for estimates accuracy in connection with any submission made of the resultant order.

Labor Category:  Hours

Senior Logistician I:  175
Logistician I:  17,100
Logistician II:  15,070
Senior Financial Analyst:  92
Technical Admin Support V:  480

It is anticipated that Option Period I will have a reduced workload estimate when compared to the Base Period as will Option Period II when compared to Option Period I although a firm estimate has not been established at this time.

There was an error in the Draft PWS period of performance whereas Option II was listed as running through September 2015.
  This is incorrect, the based period is 6 months and there are two six month option periods.

Period of Performance:
Base Period:  28 March 2013 through 27 September 2013
Option I:  28 September 2013 through 27 March 2014
Option II:  28 March 2014 through 27 September 2014

THOSE ENTITIES WHO HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THIS CHANGE BY EMAIL. **<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for U.S. Mission Germany. The U.S. Mission Germany requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>
<p>Due to the large dollar value and complexity of the U.S. Mission Germany Local Guard Program, the Department of State has determined the need to conduct a pre-solicitation conference before releasing the solicitation for this requirement. This conference will be used to highlight key areas of the solicitation, discuss issues that may affect prospective offerors ability to manage this contract, and show prospective slides of the place of performance (i.e., specific guard posts) of locations covered by this requirement in lieu of an actual "site visit" to each respective location. ATTENDANCE AT THIS PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE IS MANDATORY for any offeror who wants to submit a proposal for this requirement. This conference will be held at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, Germany at <strong>1:00 PM</strong> local on November 15, 2012.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in attending must preregister by contacting Amanda Rogers, rogersan@state.gov no later than 4:00 pm EDT, November 13, 2012. No more than three (3) representatives from each interested offeroring firm (to include potential joint venture partners) may attend the pre-proposal conference. Interested offerors shall provide the name (s) of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and DUNS number of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested offerors are solely responsible for ALL expenses resulting from this announcement (i.e. travel, lodging, per diem, proposal costs and other miscellaneous expenses, etc.) and are responsible for confirming all dates specified in this announcement by immediately checking the solicitation when posted on www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov to see if there are any changes.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates posting the U.S. Mission Germany solicitation on this site approximately <strong>forty (40)&nbsp;</strong>days after the pre-solicitation conference. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and any change will be posted on this site.</p>
<p>Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Amanda N. Rogers at rogersan@state.gov PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<p>Background:<br />Federal Occupational Health (FOH) is the largest provider of occupational health and wellness services to the Federal government. Located within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), FOH's mission is to improve the health, safety, and productivity of our Federal employees. We strive to accomplish our mission by delivering comprehensive occupational health and wellness solutions to more than 360 Federal agencies, reaching more than 1.8 million Federal employees. FOH's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and Work/Life services are available to Federal employees and their families stationed in over 100 countries around the globe. FOH also currently operates Occupational Health Centers, On-site Health and Wellness Centers, Wellness/Fitness Centers, Industrial Hygiene and Environmental Health Laboratories. In addition, we maintain an extensive network of occupational health providers, affiliate medical providers, a nationwide network of licensed mental health counselors, and environmental health professionals.</p>
<p>FOH is planning to adopt a customer - centric workflow using a web-based occupational health and safety system that includes an integrated electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate collection and management of health data in order to improve outcomes at both the individual and population levels. This EHR will also enable the tracking of employee's fitness for duty, maintain required physical qualifications, assess the effectiveness of integrated occupational health, wellness and other health promotion efforts, and advance standardization and collaboration between FOH divisions and their staff. The system will include a web-based patient portal for appointment scheduling, survey completion including a Health Risk Assessment (HRA) and will provide an employee access to their health record. Because FOH is a fee-for-service organization, the system will support the life-cycle of inter-agency service agreements and the fees associated with each service item.</p>
<p>Please Note:<br />The system must meet the standards and certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of HHS. Therefore, the system MUST be certified by one of the organizations selected by the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) as an Authorized Testing and Certification Body (ATCB) with a scope of authorization that includes "Complete EHR and EHR Modules". The complete list of current ONC-ATCBs can be found at http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;mode=2&amp;objID=3120.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:<br />FOH seeks information on available commercial products to support the implementation of a web-based enterprise level occupational health, safety and wellness solution to improve the delivery of FOH programs and preventive healthcare services. This system will provide a mechanism to track services including, but not limited to in-service physical examinations, preventive screenings, injury/illness investigations, medical and occupational health surveillance programs, employee counseling services, Law Enforcement Medical Programs, respirator equipment monitoring/fit testing, health risk assessment (HRA) data, and exposure monitoring to support FOH's clients. It will also be able to generate reports that utilize a variety of metrics to establish: <br />1. The cost effectiveness of these programs <br />2. Delineate where further targeted interventions/follow-up are indicated <br />3. Compare the results among various sites or between one or more agencies.</p>
<p>This system will also support the needs of FOH's Environment Health, Industrial Hygiene, and Employee Assistance Program (EAP). It will be able to support the business life-cycle of FOH services including the management of inter-agency service agreements, service catalog, work orders, fee for service billing and tracking as well as the fulfillment of the work orders issued for individual agencies. As the intention of the system is to be customer-centric, a web-based patient portal is a key component of the system.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number.

Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 01 - 689 - West Haven, CT is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. As such, a time-and-materials type action was awarded for commercial supplies and services (FAR 12.207(b)). <br>  <br> The United States Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center intends to award a 6-month Time-and-Materials type UCA contract on a non-competitive basis to DRS Technical Services Inc. of Herndon, VA under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source for the procurement of  Rapid Response Support Services.  The NTE amount is $11,400,000.00. <br>   <br> This effort provides infrastructure and information management systems to the Army.  It develops, acquires and deploys tactical and management IT systems and products through its various project and product managers including Project Manger Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) and PD DWTS.  These organizations provide worldwide strategic satellite communications and Wideband Control (WC) systems, long-haul terrestrial microwave, and fiber optic communications systems, Technical Control Facilities (TCFs), Combat Service Support (CSS) communications systems, critical power infrastructure, and combat vehicle intercom systems.  This includes personnel, equipment and services at locations around the world including Qatar, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Korea, Germany, Japan, and at other various locations.  This effort provides specialized engineering and installation support to Command and Control (C2) Information Technology Infrastructure (ITI) capabilities at all these locations. <br>  <br> There are in excess of 150 positions that require clearances at the Secret, Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) levels, at time of award.  DRS Technical Services Inc. is the only known source with the required personnel on site with specialized experience, security clearances, and operational familiarity needed to meet this ongoing requirement in the timeframe required, to sustain mission requirements seven days a week and 24 hours a day, at time of award, without any interruption.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330.  Award date is estimated on or about 7 December 2012.  Questions may be addressed to Stephanie A. Wilson, Contracting Officer (e-mail Stephanie.a.wilson.civ@mail.mil) or Todd Kowalke, Contract Specialist (e-mail todd.w.kowalke.civ@mail.mil). <br>

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, VA Connecticut Healthcare System & VA Manchester, Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service, Transfusion Medicine Department.

Transaction # (CT)
Transaction # (Manchester)
 Justification for other than full and open competition
	
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
Other than full and open competition as authorized by statute - 

Yearly firm fixed price purchase order is requested for Blood Bank reagent cells, panel cells and other reagents required for transfusion medicine testing at the VA West Haven Lab, Blood Bank Department, and the VA Manchester Lab, Blood Bank Department. A separate yearly purchase order is required for each site until a BPA for VISN 1 has been negotiated and put into place. Some of these products are specific for the gel testing systems that are used at the VISN 1 Blood Bank labs and produce the best results based on their quality and their predilution for use. 

The 0.8% Surgiscreen, 0.8% Affirmagen, 0.8% Resolve A, 0.8% Resolve B, and 0.8% Resolve Panel C are sole source items and can only be obtained from Ortho and used on their automated and semi-automated Gel Systems. No other manufacturer offers this product with the specific characteristics that are required for use on the Gel systems in the VISN 1 Blood Bank Labs. The other items have some substitutes available from Company A and CompanyB but their products do not meet the same quality standards as the Ortho as determined by all the Blood Bank Labs within VISN 1.  All the Ortho products have been validated already at all VISN 1 sites including the Connecticut and Manchester sites. The other products are not prediluted and do not work as well as the Ortho reagents and cells specifically engineered for use on the Gel automation and semi automation systems. 

The tech time required to make the dilutions and chance for error do not make this a practical solution and would cost the government more in the long run. Both the Company A and Company B are only validated for use using the slide and tube method and not the automated method of testing. Validation studies would require a lot of time and expense to complete in order to meet the standards of the accreditation agency that oversees the VISN 1 Labs and FDA specifically for Blood Bank Labs.

Ortho's reputation is also superior with far fewer FDA reagent recalls in the past several years. Critical Blood Bank testing services become compromised with any recall of products which in turn puts the patient's well being in jeopardy.  Ortho's customer service is very good and they are always responsive to the customer's needs. This has been demonstrated over several years in all of the VISN 1 labs. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:

		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority

Ortho Clinical diagnostics is the manufacturer of the automated and semi-automated gel blood bank testing system used at the Blood Bank Lab in the VA Connecticut Healthcare System and the Manchester VA. Some of the products are sole source products and can only be obtained from the manufacturer Ortho. No other manufacturer or vendor can provide these products. These products are specifically made for the automated and semi-automated gel testing systems. They are compatible with these systems and no other product can be used. They do not require any preparation because they are prediluted and ready to use. Ortho offers the only class of reagents that are gel compatible with their systems. Ortho is the preferred vendor for the open market items because they too are prediluted and ready to use for testing.

This eliminates technique variables and incorporates minimal handling of reagents and samples making the testing safer for the techs performing the work. Ortho offers the only class of reagents that are gel compatible with their systems. Ortho has proven quality products utilized in all the sites within VISN 1. They are reliable and cost effective. Switching to any other brand would require many comparison and validation studies and other vendor's reagents are not as sensitive or specific with the gel testing system. Other vendor's products would also require more time for the testing and increase variability while decreasing standardization and quality of work potentially putting our veterans at risk.
 
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

All sites within VISN 1 are very satisfied with the performance, reliability and cost of the Ortho products and they are compatible with the automated and semi-automated gel systems in our Blood Bank Labs. All sites have expressed that Ortho products are the only product that they would use based on past experience and a switch to another product would be very costly and not work properly with the gel systems.  All sites are currently standardized with these systems throughout VISN 1. They use the most compatible, sensitive and specific reagents and cells that work with the new gel systems in their labs. Both Company A and Company B are methods for slide and tube testing according to the manufacturer's instructions. These methods require more steps and tech intervention and do not produce the same sensitivity, specificity and standardization as do the Ortho products in conjunction with the Ortho gel systems.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based upon the fact that the pricing provided is the commercial price for these supplies and based on prior year's pricing.      

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Ortho Clinical diagnostics is the manufacturer of the automated and semi-automated gel blood bank testing systems used throughout VISN 1 and at VA West Haven and VA Manchester Blood Bank Labs. The requested products are not on Ortho's Federal Supply Schedule but are compatible with the systems. They do not require any preparation because they are prediluted and ready to use. They are also more specific and sensitive than the alternate vendor products. They have proven themselves to be quality products since all sites currently use them and find them reliable and cost effective. Switching to any other brand would require many studies and would not work properly on the gel system automation. Technical market research concluded that both Company A and Company B are methods for slide and tube testing only according to their manufacturer's instructions. These methods require more steps and tech intervention and do not produce the same sensitivity, specificity and standardization as do the Ortho products in conjunction with the Ortho gel systems.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

Vendor is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the supplies used on the automated and semi-automated analyzers and they are compatible with existing VA CT & VA Manchester equipment. These tests provide rapid and accurate results utilizing the equipment already in place in Labs within VISN 1. This system already provides a cost savings in tech time with minimum handling and is safer for the techs since there is less sample handing as well. Along with this their product is more sensitive and specific in detection of antibodies and typing. They have proven over time to be reliable and of best value to our Blood Bank labs.


10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

Contracting activity will continue to encourage brand name or equivalent specifications. VISN 1 Network Labs will continue to monitor new products to identify products that may meet our specialized needs.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1,  VA New England Healthcare System, Network Consolidated Laboratory, Mary-Ann Bridgwood, Program Manager, NCL  113, 940 Belmont St., Brockton, MA 02301
Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
New contract request for base plus 4 year option agreement for reagent test kits from Biomerieux for Lyme Disease Testing on the VIDAS 30.  Options will be exercised at the discretion of the Government.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
Kits for Lyme Disease Testing with an estimated minimum of 60 kits purchased per year 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

X    (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
The Biomerieux VIDAS 30 was purchased with equipment funds in anticipation of changing the methodology for performing Lyme Disease testing in the West Haven VA Molecular Lab. In the summer of 2011, the supervisor had access to an old VIDAS and was able to perform correlation studies to compare this new system with the current system for Lyme Disease testing.
Specificity, sensitivity and patient correlations were performed and compared and the VIDAS 30 Lyme testing method was clinically more comparable to the gold standard (western blot method of Lyme testing). Another factor was that this new test method was also much cheaper than the current methodology. These test kits are specifically made for either the VIDAS 30 or miniVIDAS and only these kits can be run on these analyzers.  Biomerieux is the manufacturer and sole source of supply for these test kits and the VIDAS 30 system.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
The cost analysis was performed by the Supervisor for Molecular Diagnostics. These were the 3 test systems/methodologies under consideration during the technical research period.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The commercial price of these test kits from Biomerieux is $X.XX/kit of 60 tests.  Biomerieux is offering the Government discounted pricing.  Pricing is deemed fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
Three different test systems/methodologies were evaluated and or considered during technical research evaluation. The Biomerieux VIDAS 30 method was cheaper and clinically better than the current method in use. The VIDAS method required 15 minutes of tech time while the current method required 45 minutes of dedicated tech time. Turnaround time was improved from 3.5 hours to 1 hour. The VIDAS method also requires less sample manipulation therefore decreasing the potential for contamination, and making it safer for the tech running the assay.  The assay showed excellent correlation with the current method and even better correlation with the Lyme Western Blot results. The VIDAS Lyme assay is the most used assay by labs that participate in the College of American Pathologists Proficiency Testing Surveys. No issues have been identified with this assay when reviewing participant summaries.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
The VIDAS Lyme method provides easy result interpretation. There is no equivocal zone for the VIDAS Lyme IgG results. It is clear cut and rapid allowing optimized treatment depending on the stage of the infection.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
Three methods were technically evaluated and/or considered.  No other sources are sought at this time due to the acquisition of the VIDAS 30 system in FY 2012.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
A base plus 4 year option provides the VA with the ability to not renew an option if the service or product does not meet the standards and requirements of the VA. This will be reviewed each year before renewing the next year's option.
